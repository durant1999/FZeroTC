10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1. The Great Wall2. Venice3. Bartolli's Hideout4. Opera House5. Offshore Rig6. Diving Area7. 40 Fathoms8. Wreck Of The Mario Doria9. Living Quarters10. The Deck11. Tibetan Foothills12.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

Tomb Raider 32. Tomb Raider 4: Last Revelations3. Tomb Raider 24. Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles5. Tomb Raider..."
12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."
10,"I am not a pro. just a dedicated homeowner with a lot of experience.For limited crown molding cutting. you could definitely do without these stops. but you would have to spend more time. They are really simple stops that just bolt in place on the table of the DeWalt saw. If you put a secondary wood platform on the table. you may have issues. I just have the saw and they mounted fine.SO. since I have had these I have done several major projects with lots of CM and have not been disappointed. They attach easily. are super sturdy and simple. If you have an appropriate DeWalt saw. just get them if you are doing CM."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
8,"Puts Frontline to shame. It killed them initially. but they came back and/or didn't get rid of them completely. Other products worked at first. but more showed up only a couple of weeks later.Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away. The only disadvantage I see is that it doesn't kill ticks. but my cats don't go outdoors so I'm more worried about fleas. Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus."
6,"I paid $6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder  .... WHAT BUNK!!  No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil. but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area!!  Not that $6 is a lot of money. but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together. when they cannot be. especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations. FALSE ADVERTISING basically."
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
6,"To use this product. first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. Not necessarily a bad thing. but a time drain if you're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation. Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits. Again. another time drain. In my case. the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder. making it look as if there was any organization. This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs. which looked much better. I would not recommend this product at all."
6,"At first I was skeptical that a business card printed on an inkjet printer would look 'professional' - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that. in fact. I can't tell the difference between a print-shop business card and the ones that I made at home.  The clean cut edge is very smooth.  To make things easy just feed the paper one at a time and put the printer on the thick-paper setting. and then fold the edges of the cards toward you when separating them."
6,"I bought these labels for two reasons; one. to use as shipping labels; second. for labelling my DVD storage cases. The 2 x 4 inch size is large enough for the addresses or the movie/TV title. and they stick very well; the application is easy and fast.  The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. They are of good quality and they are reasonably priced. I have rated these labels four stars for the design. quality and overall satisfaction."
8,"First Impression: Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift. It seems to be for lazy humans. Fetch is not my favorite game. so we don't use this toy very often. However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device. For the most part I just look at her like 'Why did you throw the ball way over there?' then she goes and gets it for me. Don't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball... But why should I retrieve it? I'm not a retriever!Conclusion: If you like to fetch. this is a great device for your parents to buy. They will be able to throw the ball farther. and they won't wear out as quickly. Plus if they are 'old' they don't even have to bend over to pickup the ball! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball. Nifty. 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie's are not big on fetch."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
8,"This has been on my &#34;puppy wishlist&#34; for almost 6 months. I've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason. It's not expensive. My dog loves to play fetch.This takes fetch to a whole new level. I can throw pretty far. but get tired out. This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out. I got the whistle balls too. which make him even nuttier. We played with this today until he could fetch no more. That's never happened before. It has a compact size. but can throw quite a distance. I haven't completely got the skill of using it down yet. but it's still pretty effective. If you are thinking about buying this. stop. Add to your cart. get a couple extra balls. and check out."
8,"I have a blue nose pit with skin conditions due to allergies.  I stopped letting her eat all the stuff she is allergic to months ago but her skin still hadn't cleared up.  She had eaten rocks a few times which told me that she was lacking some minerals.  I ordered this product and have been giving it to her for almost 2 weeks and she looks gorgeous and hasn't eaten any rocks.  Also she had always been trying to eat anything and everything she get her little paws on and now she doesn't act like she's starving. likely due to getting the vitamins and minerals she needs.She  looks gorgeous and seems very content.  I add some water to it to make it like a gravy and pour it over her food.  She loves it.  I will always feed her this.The ingredients are top notch; i will definitely reorder when I run out."
4,"This is your Momma's homemade version of animation and it'll suit me fine any day over material like &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; or for that matter. anything Disney has done of late.  Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses. certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy. especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Holly Jolly Christmas&quot;.  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone. but yourself.  I've encapsulated it in very trite terms. but make no mistake. there's nothing trite about this little gem.  It's a great one for the kids to watch over and over."
6,"These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size.  I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members.  She draws a picture and we laminate it.  Pretty easy.  Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin.  I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose.  Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5' wide pouch."
8,"I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy!  We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b/c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy.  We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way.  I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one. but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard.  It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces. but I prefer the small version of this toy.  But. it works as intended and my dog doesn't care which one I use. she loves the game."
11,"I. like many others. first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it. The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential.It's an attractive game (lot's of little pieces though!) that draws people to it. Good for getting people who don't like other German board games (Catan. Carcassone) to play. Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people. although 3-5 is ideal.The only difficult thing is the cards. They are tiny little things. and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently (the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards). This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards. I believe there is an add-on (1910?) that contains bigger cards."
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
6,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact. I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP. this stuff is expensive. especially if you print photographs. and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos. I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan. yellow. etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great. as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges. so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
6,"it is expensive. cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples. as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers. no difference."
4,"As someone who grew up with a theologian as a father. I have heard and read about the death of Jesus Christ hundreds. possibly thousands of times.  However. nothing could prepare me mentally for this film.  I have never shed so many tears in a movie theater in my entire life.  I could feel his pain and every second of his torture as he sacrificed his life for all of us.  It was more than that though.  It was the mere thought that people were made to suffer like that in those days and it was also the thought of how much so many of us complain about our lives today when so many died to get us here.  For some a flat tire will ruin their entire week.  This is a serious wake-up call for those who can appreciate it.  I left the theater with a renewed sense that all is possible as long as you try.  Mel Gibson is a magnificent actor and an even better director."
7,"Nothing like a chain saw to bring one's manliness to the fore.  This one is more powerful than I anticipated. and the fact that it can be used both at ground level targets and those in the air is an added advantage. The saw attaches easily to the pole.  Trimming that limb over your fence. no problem (assuming you don't smash the fence).  Cleans up yard trash in a snap.  I did not experience the oil leakage described by others.  The chain doesn't turn fast enough to burn. so oiling isn't as critical as with a gas saw. And the fact that it's green will appeal to your feminine side."
7,"If you&#8217;re looking for a well made axe and you don&#8217;t want to spend over a hundred dollars to get it then this is what you should buy!  I have beat the hell out of mine so far this wood season and so far I&#8217;ve gone through over 6 cords of tamarack pine and oak and this thing never seems to tire me out!  Love the light weight handle which is not cheaply made. but absorbs most of the off strikes and doesn&#8217;t seem the worse for wear. just some nice scars.  Holds an excellent edge and cuts through wood like a hot knife through butter.  EXCELLENT PRODUCT!"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
9,"I was an Dr. Bronner's almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I've recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to. almost an acquired taste.Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.This isn't my favorite scent. but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner's. For a grade I give it an A."
11,"Monty Python's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs.The basic rules are simple draw one and play one. however the draw rules the play rules. the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card.This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things. the Knights who say Ni. rules that count '1-2. 5 (3 sir)' and actions that can be taken if the rules get 'Much too Silly!'The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know. its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it.  It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble.This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home.  Get it."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
9,"Here is the scoop. I did a bunch of comparison research.  I chose this optic because of its eye relief and rugged reputation. I mounted it on my cetme rifle. It is tough as nails. Zeroed just fine and is fast to pick up on low power and plenty powerful enough for100-200 yard shooting. The optics are clear and bright. Solid system. It does what it is suppose to do. Best quality scope in its power and cost bracket. Easily handles 308 load recoil. My first choice would be the Redfield 2-7 33 mm. The bushnell was half that cost. I use equipment hard and only use good proven stuff I can depend on to protect my world and put meat on the table. This optic system does both very well."
11,"This is probably one of the better dice rolling games out there. They have just enough mechanics in the game to change the random nature of dice into a not-quite-as-random set of parameters that make for an enjoyable game. this game has the unique feature of letting you have as many or as few players as you want to play. making it an easy pick up and play game.My only complaint is the game is not very balanced. some investigators are clearly better than others. and some cards are mind blowingly difficult to defeat due to the random nature of dice."
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
9,"Whether you're working in the yard. the garage. at work or in the field. having a tool kit is essential.  This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release.  A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire.  An 8 cm and 3' ruler are integrated into the handles.  The file. screwdrivers. bottle opener. Phillips screwdriver. and knife are all easy to access and operate.  A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools.  For the price and the number of tools. this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall. I am pleased with the Tool Kit."
7,"After reading the listing and reviews. I expected a length in the range of 5 feet and that's what I got. With that in mind and my expectations in check....this is exactly what I needed to trim a huge hedge. The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall. You may think this trimmer has a huge extension length but it does not. It has two sections that couple as one section and that is it. What it does have that is nice is a head that pivots in so many directions. This thing works and I am really pleased with my purchase. As far as heavy...15 minutes is about tops before you may want to rest your arms."
7,"The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick. and at five feet away it's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick.  As a result. it broke on the second day.  Amazon replaced with another. which broke due to same issue. but this time was too late to return.  I bought another. more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else: ARS LA-180ZR203 4-to-7-Feet Long Reach Pruner"
3,"I expected a War story about U-Boats in WWI what I got was love story about a young girl and a fledgling U-Boat captain. The author. whoever it was. captured the essence of the aristocratic German officer. It was interesting how his attitudes toward the war and country were affected by his love for Zoe. There is a little bit of U-Boat combat action but that is a mere sideshow to the love story. Not a War story involving lots of action. but not a bad little love story."
3,"This was a great little addition to the series. I love having another look into Bella & Z's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents. Given Z's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking. But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great. His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes. This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series!"
3,"When you buy a .99 romance book. you never know what you are going to get.I could not put this story down. It was so wonderfully written. I love second chance at romance stories and the way this followed a blossoming high school romance to betrayal to the hero and heroine finding their way back to each other.After  I finished this book I immediately went searching for more books by this author. I was sad to see there were none. Ms Leedy. when you do write another book. you are officially on my auto buy list.Pick this book up if you are a romance lover. you will not be disappointed."
3,"I think this story has such a low rating is because it was offered free on the kindle and people who normally don't read this specific genera put their two cents in.  Let's be clear...this is futuristic erotic.  And for its genre it is very good.  So if you like sci-fi. and you like erotic. then this book is for you.  Plus. the other three books in the series are also very well written.Don't let the low star ratings push you away from this story."
9,"Ended up returning it and getting the Becker bk7 but it's really just personal preference vs any major flaws with this knife.  It is a whole different type of tool.  The Becker is massive. burly. tough. heavy duty and heavy.  The SOG is light. nimble. and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade.  I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker.  It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.  Nice knife. just not what I needed."
7,"I purchased this in May 2011.  One year later and I'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle. Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months. so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use.I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types.  The nozzle worked well in the beginning. though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it wouldn't last many years.  After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop.  Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off.I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it."
3,"I don't mind when authors write a back story. but come on....more then half the book is about their early years. Why have a full chapter beginning from when they were 7-8 years old all the way through high school and beyond. when more then 3/4 of that had nothing to do with what really broke Lizzy and Payton apart in the first place? More then half those chapters didn't even relate to what happened anyway. All those extra added chapters just became so boring. and very repetitious. if you ask me.I will admit; after the first 6 chapters I started skimming through. and I very rarely ever do that....ever!Would I recommend this book? Sorry to say. but no."
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
7,"Not sure if this really gets mosquitoes.  It does kill everything else. It is like a redneck carnival outside!  It goes crazy the first few nights it is outside and then tapers off.  So it does a good job of keeping bugs down.  Unfortunately it kills good bugs and pesky bugs.I bought the mosquito sent. but they don't stay stuck to the bottom well.  There is not enough surface area for the sticky part to adhere to.It is also pretty bright.  I had to close the blinds at night as it lite up the whole room."
3,"When Sociology professor Meg visits a jungle in South America looking for ruins. she finds a wounded jaguar.  When she hears her local helpers are all running away the next day. she finds out what scared them off.  It turns out the wounded jaguar is a man.Santiago knows that human women and his kind don't mix.  So when she helps save his life. he starts falling for her.Treasure Hunting is a nice little treasure.  With some Indiana Jones type action. some creepy bad guys. some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!). this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian"
7,"I love this feeder.  It is a little bit bigger than I expected. but I absolutely love it.  I especially like the weathervane on the roof. which is also the latch that opens and closes the top.  The opening to fill the feeder is quite large so it is very easy to fill and the feeding area is great for handling the peanuts and sunflower seeds I put in and hasn't jammed or anything like that.  An interesting feature is being able to control the bar that is meant to keep squirrels out; I haven't figured out what adjustments I need to make. but it is a neat feature. Overall. I am very happy with my feeder and I am looking forward to getting a lot of bird traffic in my backyard with it."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I'd like to preface this review with a few important points. As stated in the title. I hate hippies. I do not support Dr. Bronner's pothead activism. I also don't buy into all that vegan. organic. or sustainable garbage. And the grammatically incorrect 'inspirational' phrases printed all over the label of this product make me cringe in disgust.All that being said. this liquid peppermint soap is AWESOME. It is intensely refreshing and I can't believe how squeaky-clean it leaves my skin. So while I don't endorse the brand. the man behind it. or their target consumer group. I highly recommend this soap. Shower with it and it'll leave you with a WOW feeling of crisp. tingly refreshment."
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
9,"The Zoom range is very nice 6x gives you plenty of field of view. At 18X you don't need a spotting scope with you and you can really zoom in on your target area for some precision shooting.I have it mount on a varmint AR-15 with a 24' barrel. I was able to produce some crazy small groups with this setup.Shooting .223/5.56mm did not throw it off zero or rattle anything loose.I added some butler creek flip up lens covers:Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #17 Eyepiece (Rear)Butler Creek Flip-Up Rifle Scope Lens Cover #47 Objective (Front)I used xx-high weaver tactical rings.I highly reccomend this product."
11,"This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by-and-large the same as in your other sets. There are four new cards that may be played out-of-term to mess with other player's card plays.But the clever part is in the Goal. Keeper and Creeper cards. which manage to evoke every popular Sci-Fi 'vehicle' you've heard of (and maybe some you haven't) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners. This is so clever I have no way to describe it.Play is the usual 'define the game as you play' affair. The theme is an amusing and clever one. as I've said. I recommend it. though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx."
11,"We've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times. For a game that has seemingly simple rules. it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well. Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking. Thankfully. the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy-to-understand. logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail.There's no setup involved. All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on (like a dining-room table). The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible. It's compact and stores easily.About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate. Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green. Other than this. this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests."
7,"I would rate this product at 5 stars easily based on how well it works. I give it 4 stars because I opened the package and realized there was only one glue card in the box. I did not think this was a big deal until the next morning I realized how well it worked and the glue card was full! I had to order some more glue cards and I am still amazed at how fast they fill up. Many different types of flies and even mosquitos get stuck on this thing. It works great!_Bottom Line_  I would recommend this product and suggest buying more glue cards ahead of time because this light actually works and the cards will need to be changed often!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
9,"1) To replace the batteries in them. get ready for a battle.  DUMB way to do it.  Just dumb.  Have to pull off or pry off the soft rubber circle. with hard insert the rubber circle attaches to. which NORMALLY means you will rip or tear the soft. rubber circle....2)  Turns on accidentally WAY too easy when folding them up. or throwing them around. thus dead batteries. thus having to replace them MUCH more often then you should have. thus. enduring #1 too frequently."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
5,"I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech. These work well with the Telecaster tone and string through design. I like the tones I get from these and the price is very good. I do know that Ibanez uses XL's with all of their new guitars and I have used these srtrings with an older strat and they last a long time and stay in tune without issue mostly due to their basic fundamental design.I am not loyal to any string company. but I find that different companies work well on different guitars. I am a big DR string user with my other guitars which require thicker strings. so using 9 guage is new to me.Originally. I went to the shop for some EB super Slinky's after snapping the high E string which were sold out and went with these and could not be happier. I may buy the same strings next time. but I see Telecaster players using GHS Boomers in 9's. so that is also an option for the future."
2,"I chilled the ingredients and the bowl prior to use. and only had to leave the ice cream maker on 15 minutes ! After trying the custard base ice cream and the yogurt. I'd say I prefer the yogurt base better.  Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat. Too much stress and time for me !  The texture and flavor to me was similar.I already had beautiful homemade yogurt in my fridge (courtesy of Saltons yogurt maker and AMAZON.) Try the chocolate frozen yogurt included in the booklet. tart yet sweet. yum.Ease of use is a definite 5 star.  All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly. The noise is a 3.  I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.  Would I run it during dinner etc. no.I would recommend this product and purchase again."
3,"This book did not pan out as advertised. There is very little submarine action in the plot. and that doesn't start until 70% of the book has been read. The underlying mystery of a murder on the boat is a little more interesting. but is still no grabber. There were many opportunities to punch up the story with tense action scenes. but the drama is just not there. From beginning to end the plot is flat. causing the reader's interest to flag. Next to the no action scenario. the biggest fault I found was the excessive amount of religion included in a book of this type. Another shortcoming was the number of typos. and misspelled or missing words. Given the above. this is not a book I would highly recommend."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
10,"Does not fit the Porter Cable band saw's 16'x16' work table -- falls short.  I managed to drill a couple holes in the rail (making it un-returnable) before realizing that the fence wouldn't actually span all the way across the table to have the back end rest on its rail.This is. of course. not the fault of the manufacturer.  It seems like a quality product that might stay true even without having the back of the fence supported (and I'll continue to use it).  The indicator over the front rail's rule sits far enough above it that parallax makes it hard to determine what measurement it's actually indicating.Easy to assemble. nice packaging. and quick shipping.  Worth considering if you have a saw that it fits."
5,"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums. its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor. PG seies. digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure."
10,"Essentially. BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the  way. I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt's and used the Hitachi's ( which I  thought may be comparable. because they look similar. except for the color.  and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison. The BOSCH is  by far the best. Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable  difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we're supposed to )  to what you're cutting. Both the top handle and barrel grip are  irreplacable. anytime anyone has used mine. they get them too !"
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
4,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now. but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more.  However. this video is fun and challenging and I  would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing.  The  cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this  crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor.  Keith  Cooke is pleasant too. but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael  Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli  Roberts working out along with the gang.  A MUCH better buy than those  overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,"This is my very first mini processor. i was so excited to get it for making baby puree.  Its a good size for that purpose.small enough i can leave it on the counter top.  However. i am disappointed after my first try.  I put baby carrot  and broccoli in it. used on HI as recommended. many of the carrot didn't get chopped properly. i can still see quite big chuck in it.  I have used the same receipt to make puree in a blender(non-cuisinart) before. and the texture turn out perfect. just like the glass jar puree you get from store. This one is quite grainy."
1,"Ok... so I got this because a friend recommended melatonin to help me sleep at night. The first night I tried it I got a little relaxed. fuzzy sleeping feeling for maybe 5 minutes (I was already a little tired) and then BAM I felt hyper. Every other time I tried it since then? Nada. I might as well be drinking water.As for taste... I love me some straight up spirits. so the alcoholy part didn't bother me. It reminded me a bit of NyQuil meets a bit of. I don't know.. some sort of flavored vodka. I'm certainly drank worse things."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
2,"I am surprised by all the good reviews of this vacuum.  I purchased this recently and am returning it right away.  I used it for about 5 minutes. and the smell from the machine was so horrible I had to air my whole house.  It actually made me ill.  It is made of plastic that smells. and for anyone sensitive to smells. beware of this vacuum.  It also does not have a place to add a hepa filter. which it had stated in the description. and I really need a hepa filter on the vacuum.I had bought this for my basement floors. but I would never use it.  I have a Miele for the upstairs. and I'm considering finding a used Miele for the basement also.  No smells from the Miele and you are able to add a hepa filter.  It may be more expensive. but it would be worth it."
12,"Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now. Lara kicks way more...in this one then in the first. Some of the reasons why are listed here:Excellent 3D levels such as -1.

12,"I realized how much I sucked at RPG's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it's one of the best games in the franchise. The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997. you can't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are. The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII. the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal. The story is great and just like the other FF titles. the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well. The Final Fantasy games don't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD. FFVII is a classic. Good luck trying to 'beat' it. *crosses fingers*"
1,"I recently got a new job and have been driving an hour a day to get to it.  So I started taking coffee in this deep thermos mug which quickly became soiled.  This brush really does the trick and I have found it so useful for other cleaning operations.  Not good as a toothbrush. but good back scratch!  I took of one star because it doesn't really look so good. and the whole to hang it should be a smidge bigger so it goes over hooks more easilier."
5,"I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar. it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately. and you would be more likely give up. This. on the other hand. is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments. this included. It plays very loud and clear. zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else. look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case. So I bought this one here. that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"
5,"I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif. simple and easy set up. just plugged it in and it worked fine. no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal. a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif. that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that. so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL)."
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
12,"If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists. new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title &quot;The Wind Waker&quot; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of &quot;Ocarina of Time&quot; for Game Cube. Not just the good old &quot;Ocarina of Time.&quot; made famous on N64. but also an enhanced version called &quot;Master Quest.&quot; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
7,"The body of this being glass is very nice so it will last in the hot sun and survive the dishwasher.  However. it makes it pretty heavy. so if you are using a window hanger. make sure its on there REALLY good.  The body comes unscrews from the top hanger easily. backing it a breeze to take down and refill.  Not sure 4 seats are necessary as hummingbirds don't like to share. but it doesn't effect its usage.  Wish the body was a little bigger to hold more as the birds go through it every 3 days. but that would probably make it too heavy.  Didn't influence my rating though."
4,"Minette Walters' sensational first novel made her an instant star in the mystery world. and this 3-hour 1998 TV adaptation is very faithful to the original book. Three women in a remote country house are suspected when the decomposing body of a man is found in the old ice house on their property. and it's up to the local police chief (Corin Redgrave) and his enthusiastic sergeant (a very young Daniel Craig) to solve the case. The writing. direction. and acting are first-rate. and Penny Downie (who played Adam Dalgliesh's assistant. Kate Miskin. in the BBC adaptations of the P. D. James novels) is a particular standout as the mysterious lady who owns the house. Great atmosphere and an intelligent story--what more could you want? Highly recommended.PS--You should also read the original novel. and all of Minette Walters's wonderful suspense novels. She's one of the best writers around."
12,"They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge. but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order. as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next. as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But. even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one. it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although. does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels. but it's only for the PC)"
12,"Ok. alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying (i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider (the 2nd. and 4th onwards) should be named 'City Raider' the graphics are kinda yellowish. the lighting can be harsh. but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat (partially cause i jumped triliogy installments)but its an ok game. its better than the 2nd. and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
1,"There are a lot more expensive multivitamins than Twinlab's. and they're probably a whole lot better. too. However. I don't personally need anything fancier than this basic multi because I take various other supplements as well.For anyone who wants a very convenient routine. where you don't have to plan out what additional supplements besides a multi to take. I also recommend theJarrow Formulas Jarrow Pak Plus. It contains a month's supply of vitamins. minerals and nutraceuticals in convenient foil packets.I'm one of those people who cannot swallow thick 'horse pills.' I have no problem with this multi. It is a rather thin. oblong capsule. and I am able to swallow it easily.By the way. it's important for men and women past menopause to take an iron-free multivitamin. and this one fulfills that need."
12,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump. crawl. slide. ride on a jetboat. and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh. and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game. then you won't need it. but... it's recommended. In conclusion. this is a fantastic game. and if you love this. make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
12,"I don't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional. The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice. The characters look much like blocks of polygons. but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7's are seamless. The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris's theme is my favorite. but one can't forget One Winged Angel. which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot. In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once. It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause; of self-doubt and self-searching; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds. The characters' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future."
1,"After I bought one of these and started using it. my dentist noticed how much better my teeth were and made a note on my record that I use a Sonicare. I used to have to go three to four times a year to have tartar removed and now I don't have to go as often. So this toothbrush paid for itself in less than a year. Plus it feels so wonderful after brushing. The charge holds plenty long. the timer is a nice feature to make sure you brush long enough. Buy enough replacement heads. because the brush works better if you replace the heads every few months. I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. and I certainly do it after drinking coffee. My teeth look a lot whiter."
2,"First. this is a very cute machine. I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop. I was worried it might be loud after reading a review. but it is NOT - not at all. We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great. The only thing is. I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says. because it was quite sweet. The sorbet was yummy and fresh. and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away. Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream. and it was delicious. It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish. With summer approaching. this will be a fun machine to have around for the kids and guests! Making ice cream and other frozen treats was never so easy and fun!"
2,"Macy had these for $39.99 so I bought three.  All three failed within a very short period of time.Cuisinart charges $10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart. plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice. repackage the unit. deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $17 difference in simply buying another unit.Then again. why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you'll be going through the same process a few months later."
1,"I'm a big fan of the Oxo Good Grips products generally and this brush does not disappoint. The list price on Amazon is about the same as you will see at most offline retailers but Amazon's actual sale price makes it more comparable with similar generic brushes in the offline places.The brush is very sturdy. easy to manipulate and clean. and stands up to some tough cleaning situations. The bristles don't deform under heavy use. which is usually what happens with other brushes I've tested. We've found this to be a very solid product and will definitely buy the same replacement whenever this starts to fail."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
10,"very satisfied with the amount of light this thing puts out. would be nice if you could adjust the beam like you can with maglites. the bigger battery that this goes with comes in handy because it makes the light more stable on uneven surfaces. used it all day today in my crawl space and the articulating head. amount of light and stability all made this a great help in my project.updated: 12/11/10 - i have two of these and both had a problem with the switch after a year or so. took it to my local milwaukee repair center and they fixed them free of charge. then they sent them back to my house. also free of charge. i still highly recommend this product."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
4,"This is one of my favorite Godzilla films. This release is unique compared to most of the other dvds. because it has both the english and japanese versions of the film. The only bad thing in my opinion. is that it is widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9.In other words. it has big bars. but you could probably solve that problem with your dvd player manual. The lighting is pretty good throughout the movie. except for a few night scenes. Overall. I'd say the performance is pretty good.As I mentioned in my title. the packaging has one flaw. It's not like a normal dvd case as you can probably see. It opens kind of like a book which makes it less secure than the average dvd case. However. the disc stays in pretty well. Bottom line. this is an excellent choice."
5,"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose. nearly stripped. when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.  Had I paid $300 or more for the guitar I'd have been upset. but as is that was an easy fix.My biggest complaint is that the finish on the body is thicker and less &#34;natural&#34; that the image appears to be.  It's pretty enough. and fine for a $100 guitar.  But I really wanted &#34;natural wood&#34; and it isn't.  Otherwise it would be a 5 star.  I play it every day."
5,"I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable. but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable. played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then. I turned the amp off. unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next.  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
10,"I have been an amature woodworker for some time now but I'm new to the scroll saw.  I bought this one because I thought it would have little vibration due to it's mass.  Was I ever right!!  Others have said that it has a small amount of vibration. but that doesn't do it justice; this saw doesn't vibrate. That alone has made it a wonderful tool for me.  I can concentrate on learning fretwork instead of wrestling with vibration.The one downfall is the &quot;hold down&quot;. While simple to use. I have a hard time getting the right presure on the workpiece."
2,"I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots. My worst problem is when the scraps of food are extremely sticky and they won't come off even with repeated scrubbing with soft sponge. and that is when I decided to get this kitchen brush.The nylon brush tips are amazing. they are gentle to your stainless pots but are strong enough to make short work of those food scraps. There are even brush tips at the bottom of the brush that allow you to point it perpendicular to the bottom surface of the pot and clean it when you need to angle it pointing straight down. Amazing brush. just like the OXO bottle brush!"
6,"I purchased this two years ago for one reason: to have a phone I can use when the power goes out. which happens several times a year.Modern phones are terrific... as long as they have electric power.  When the power goes out. however. they are helpless.  I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out. but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery.  I can check with the power company. talk with neighbors. and potentially most important. if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.  Just store it in a location that's easy to access when you have no lights."
1,"I've been using these patches for years for international flights and have always been amazed at how well they seem to work. I don't even crave a cigarette while on the plane. However. I realized that maybe it's easier to not crave a cigarette when you know you can't have one anyways (since it's illegal to smoke on a flight). I'd always rip the patch off and light one up again after getting my luggage. What a mnistake. I should have stuck with it. But now I'm going to finally try to use these patches to really quit. once and for all. I smoke ultra-lights -- about a pack a day or a little more. I think I'm going to start with the 14 mg. ones first. and if I find that I'm still having cravings. then I'll bump up to the 21 mg."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
10,"I purchased this tool to replace the drill press mortising attachment I had been using.  This is so much more convenient and a bargain if you can find it on sale.The tool is great and had no defects when I unpacked it.  Assembly was easy. If you pay attention during setup and use care while operating. this tool will cut perfect mortises every time.  This is not a production machine but is perfect for a small shop like mine.  It does require some skill on the part of the operator to ensure proper setup and use.My only complaint is that the chisels needed some clean-up work to improve their finish and some sharpening."
4,"This is #5 in the series of wonderful Godzilla films. This time the big lizard is a good guy in the end. Throw in Mothra in caterpillar form. Rodan and finally Ghidorah and you have a huge Japanese monster kill or go home flick. The three headed Ghidora is awesome in this film and is bent on destroying mankind until the big three conjure up a tag team for the ages. The fairy twins help cipher what Mothra's plans are that includes a plan to chase off the tri headed bad flying pest from another planet. There's also a sub plot where a princess is on the run and snaps in and out of consciousness and eventually ties into the monster story. Have fun with this one..good fights and cool story with a good ending."
1,"I really like OXO products so I expected that I would like this grout brush when I purchased it as an Add On item to fill out an order.  To my surprise. I not only like it. I love it.  I was one of those who was using an old toothbrush to do grout and I can't believe how much better the grout looks using this brush and with a lot less effort.I was so happy with the brush that I ordered another for the upstairs shower a week later.  This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
1,"I'm so sick of adhesive bandages (and face it - we all call them band-aids!) falling off and not sticking.  And I've tried the more expensive sports and waterproof ones and (yes. I admit it) I have tried the other less expensive brands. but go through them like water. because they just don't stick.  These basic Band-Aid brand adhesive bandages get the job done and STICK!  AND this huge. very inexpensive pack has LOTS of different sizes for all of our possible needs.  I hope I don't go through them too quickly. but I will likely purchase another box. just in case!This package includes the following:8 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1.75' x 4'120 Comfort-Flex Sheer  1' x 3'40 Comfort-Flex Clear  .75' x 3'82 Comfort-Flex Sheer  .625' x 2.25'30 Comfort-Flex Clear Spots  .875' x .875'"
2,"The slicer is slightly smaller than a large cheese brick so you can't use it unless you slice some off the side first... but when you do use it- it slices a perfect wedge about the right size for a sandwich.Only problem. is. the more slices you need. the harder the plane is to slice through the cheese because it really starts to stick to the cheese. and does so more and more after each slice.I love OXO normally. so. I also got the wire cheese slicer.  It works much better than the cheese plane does."

11,"This is a pretty fun group game. but can drag a bit with multiple players. This is because people want to calculate their moves on the board before committing to the best possible route.  A fun variation we like to play is that when you start your turn. you declare your gear and then roll.  Once you roll. you 'drive' the car the necessary moves.  No take backs. no do overs.  This encourages players to pay attention to their car when it is not their turn. and also adds and element of hazard that would be present in a real driving\racing situation.  Makes a good party game. but you may want to limit games to one lap per game."
6,"How bad can a mouse pad be?  That's what I thought....First. be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad.  Basically. it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32' foam pad.  Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads. but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides. and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad isn't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it.  It is very distracting.Finally. the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it.  VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles. so 2 stars."
6,"There is no doubt that more people are choosing to get mobile phones for whenever they need to call up. as well as cordless phones for mobile use at home. But there are still those of us whom would just rather prefer the need of just having a simple phone for one place in the house to call. That is the case with AT&T;'s 210 Corded Phone. This is a very simple and easy to use phone that works for just about anyplace in the house. where you want to keep your calls stationery. I also found it to be very easy to read and understand. and rings louder than my cordless handsets in need of a call to home. If you really are looking for a extra phone for the home or the office. than I definitely recommend this classic phone from AT&T.;Price: B+Convience: BOverall: B 1/2+"
11,"Party Gras is a great party game.  Players can range from teens to lively adults.  The game comes packaged in a clear. durable plastic tote bag versus the typical game box.  The plastic case makes it easy to transport from one party to the next.  The bright. festive. eye-catching colors is what drew me to this game.  I think that most groups of 4 or more will enjoy playing this game if the participants are outgoing and have a good sense of humor.  This game is not for introverts or for someone seeking a high educational value from a game.  Party Gras is a great ice breaker. good humorous family/friend fun. and a welcomed change from board games that keep you seated.  Start the holidays and new year off with something different...Party Gras.  If you tire of this game. just find another person that likes games and do an exchange."
9,"These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself. I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid's sized. but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing. The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight. and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically. The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an 'okay' job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents. I'll never be buying these again. nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children....(in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them.)"
10,"I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting. They are used in the under-cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter. About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs. This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably (lower currents in the system means less wear and tear. so the speak). But they still burn out. These bulbs are a perfect replacement. They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs. but the difference is barely noticeable. I give them a thumbs-up."
9,"I've had experience with Victorinox Swiss Army knives for over 40 years.  My primary casual pocket knife has been the Swiss Army 'Mechanic' for over 20 of those years.  I've always been satisfied with the quality. and with the fine edge you can achieve with the Victorinox stainless steel.  This knife is no exception. Same fine quality.  A little large to comfortably carry in my pocket. but a problem easily remedied with the available Victorinox Cordura Belt Pouch for Swiss Army Knives. Two of the most useful features of this knife are the scissors and the pliers.  Of course you also have the available screwdrivers. as well as all the other features.  It's amazing how handy this knife has been.  There have been times. when I don't have the knife with me. that I find myself reaching for it to perform a certain task. and then. &#34;Drats. I wish I had it with me.&#34;"
10,"I've used the Jorgensen Bar Clamps for years. Bought some other clamps as they were cheaper.  Over the years I know when I am picking up a Jorgensen Clamp.  Fit and finish does well in my workshop which rusts tools! Needed a good vise. It was highly rated and I am impressed by the company. Have yet to install it but it looks well made and it is sturdy.Down side is they need to have a better set of instructions. Can't find anything when I Google it. Some You Tube Videos by ambitious woodworkers. but companies should be doing it!"
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
6,"I haven't used this a lot yet. but. based on my fairly small sample of experience. this product is a lot stronger than other mounting tape I've tried.  We used it putting up posters at a fundraising event and it did an outstanding job - even on a brick wall.  It gripped the wall and the posters very well.  It didn't take a great deal of length to hold bulky and moderately heavy posters.  Pretty much exactly what you're looking for from a product like this."
6,"These are general use return address/locate labels. 2 inch by 4 inches.  I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers. so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And. of course. Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning. so you can not loose buying these.  And the TrueBlock really works.  I took one of the blank labels and pasted it on the dark blue folder the lables come in.  No blue shows through. it is pure white.."
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
6,"Packaging says that the mouse pad is 50% pre-consumer recycled content. and that the packaging card is 100% post-consumer recycled material.Seems like a decent mouse pad and it'll fit my needs. I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently. I don't mean to slight a product because of it's color. but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey."
3,"During the wholes series I was and I am a fan of DJ. I love the way she treats her friends and helps them. Even love her bad habbits :-).What I did not like was the way this story was going. Quinn isn't able to stand a woman. who is standing on her own feet and not fearing to fight for herself? Does he really need to make her small to fell great. feel like a man?For me this book is pushed high. You must know Susan Mallory offers her readers in the US free books 14 days before publishing and they have to write a review to be in the next round for a free book."
8,"I have an 8-pound toy poodle whose passion is fetching balls.  Her mouth is so small she could not get the regular chuckit ball in her mouth and carry it very far.  I ordered this mini-chuckit and though the ball is a little bigger than her very small balls. it works fine and she catches it in her mouth as it's heading toward earth. I have noticed that this mini-chuckit hurles the ball much farther than the regular. which is great because she loves to go far to fetch it.  We use this launcher several times a day and we never get tired of it.  The ball it came with got trashed within a month so I bought Tuff Balls to replace it.  We absolutely love this launcher.  It's fabulous for the beach.  You can't go wrong with this if your little toy dog loves fetching."
1,"We have 3 of these. and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to. and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory. but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best. as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things. so while I preach 'pack light'. they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately. one charge lasts at least a week. so the charging base is only needed on extended trips."
11,"I don't know why my expectations were so low on this product. Frankly. I've been playing RPGs since I was 14 which would be the summer of 1979. Back then RPGs products were crap. I recently decided it would be fun to play some of these games again so I picked up this because I really liked the theme of it and the videos FFG did really won me over. Overall this screen is well made (boardgame quality construction for the screen) and the content of information on it is perfect for anyone not familiar with the conventions of this game which will be about 90% of their customers since so much of it appears to be new.If you have an android device or iOS get the FFG dice roller as well. Its MUCH cheaper than the physical dice!Star WarsTM Dice"
1,"I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy. wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation. itching. skin staining. clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again. it's just wasting money."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
10,"I've had the opportunity to use many different belt sanders over the years. This one is hands down the best one you can buy. Superb engineering. and design. coupled with flawless manufacturing produces this gem. You simply can't go wrong with this sander. I especially like the variable speed feature. This thoughtful feature makes it possible to adjust your at load speeds which helps with softer material. An architect friend and I have used these sanders on many materials including wood. The 3X21 model is this boys little brother. which I found to be a benefit when I need to work upside down. If you're looking for a belt sander. this one will keep you happy."
5,"I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables.  If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound. this might not be the cable for you.HOWEVER. for the price and purpose this a five star cable.  The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection. but also feel sturdy and secure.  The gold plating ensures a solid connection.What I like most about this cable is that it's guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement... or so their packaging claims.  I have not had to replace mine."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
11,"The kids love this guy BUT the programing is not easy. The buttons are a little bit tricky to press and for my 8 year old. it was confusing. Once I programmed it. we had a good time with it. It is great for talking about measuring and basic ideas of computer programing. If only you could program it from a PC... seems like it would not be too difficult to add a USB interface of some kind.If I could give 3.5 stars I would. If it was a little less difficult. it would get 5 stars. For a 10-12 year old. it may be just right."
9,"In my humble opinion. the best supertool around. and I own probably two dozen of them that I've collected over the years. The tool exhibits a fit and finish better than anything else out there. and one great feature is that the tools fold out from the outside of the handle. It featured a positive locking mechanism when most of the other tools still had yet to offer it. including the famous Leatherman. Even with all the innovative multitools of recent years with each new one trying to outdo the other. this took remains head and shoulders above the rest. Next to this. as with a previous reviewer. I would rate the Leatherman Supertool as best."
1,"For most people. that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector). you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life. so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe. and feel like a big spender."
5,"This case it built really well. it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck. it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe."
5,"I've used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel. sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you can't go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them."
10,"I use this tool weekly and it's well made as most Dewalt tools are.  This saw can be found elsewhere including the stand for less money.  A MAJOR FAULT in the design of this tool is when you go to switch blades or reposition the blade whole doing delicate scroll work is that the arm will not stay up and you have to find a 2x4 or something to hold it in the up position!!!  I have heard that there is some sort of retrofit available to solve this problem but can't find it.  Otherwise this is a great tool!"
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
6,"I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back. I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits (you know. the ones with the syringes?). Both ruined my printer. after awhile. They seem to work initially. but you can tell the colors are off. Sure. the generic inks are so much cheaper. but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink. Trust me on this one. buy Canon OEM cartridges!"
1,"I had the older version of this from a couple of years back. and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband. and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one. and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid. though. it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions."
10,"Bought this router with the idea of using it in a table exclusively. I Figured it would be too heavy for using it without a table. but I was wrong: the smooth slowstart feature and the router having no vibration makes it easily controlled.I did end up mounting it in a table and it works great with large style and rail cutters.I compared this against the larger DeWalt. but this one won based on price. As to performance. they are probably equal.If you need a larger router for a good price. get this one."
1,"What can I say? Metemucil works. not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels. Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly. it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF. has no MSG or related products or aspartates."
10,"Replaced my standard router base with this D-handle for better control when routing dovetails using a dovetail jig. Just one thing to keep in mind is the cord on a standard base 690 is too long for use with this handle. There is no good way to manage the extra cord so I shortened my cord on the router and will use an extension cord if I need to use the fixed base again. It was easy to remove the cover on the router and shorten the cord or you could just cut the cord to length and add a new plug if you are nervous about getting inside the router."
6,"This is 200 sheets of wide rules filler paper.  It has three holes punched for your binder.  The lines don't fade or smudge as some lesser filler papers are prone to do.  It is crisp. clean. white. smudgeproof. and looks and performs like the best papers in the world. at a reasonable price.  I like to get 200 sheets in a package as this is a generous size but not so much that I have to store a lot of excess paper on a shelf where it can get dusty.  Mead makes great office supplies from the ones I've been seeing lately."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"I love power ! This tool delivers boat loads of it. But you know what ? It doesn't sound like it. I was never able to use a belt sander before without earplugs. This one runs at only 84 Db. It's the quietest on the market. It's also the smoothest I've used.I've used all of the 4x24 sanders and the Makita just seems to do more work faster. Maybe it's the fact that it has the highest speed of any . maybe it's the high tech . powerful motor .the efficient drive train. Whatever it is . it kicks butt . The dust collection system is also top notch. For small jobs and fine work . I prefer my Bosch 1274 dvs. It's much lighter .compact and easy to control. For extended use or heavy sanding though . you cannot beat this tool."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
3,"K.A. Mitchell is my favorite M/M author. her ability to create realistic characters is amazing.  I love that in this story both men would be what I would call Alpha types. even though it's primarily Jeff in charge. Ryan also steps up.  Very realistic storyline. Jeff can't let out that he's gay for fear of losing the time he has with his daughter. Ryan was in the Air Force so he's been in that same scenario where he has to hide that part of him. The sex scenes this author writes are incredibly descriptive & erotic; makes me feel a little like a voyeur!I do agree with the other reviewers that the book does end abruptly and hope the story is continued.What I didn't like: 2/3 of the book is the story. the last 1/3 of the kindle book is advertisements for other books to read/buy.  So very short story. but still a great quick read that I feel was worth the price."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
3,"I was eager to read this novel and downloaded it at the time it was 0.99. Big spender I know but I am glad I did not spend more. I was intrigued by the concept and some of the scenes of college life are both surreal and funny. Though that is all the positives I have for this meandering book. I mean there is no Jekyll Hide scenario. no ON/OFF if you will. Its like the whole book is more off than on. there is one speed and it is slow. Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective. but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny. but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me."
3,"Recently stating that I very seldom find a 5 star book. I have now read 2 in a row. Naturally I'm pleased! I have read Stephanie Bond before but nothing as good as this book. Hero is reviewing a hotel recently bought by a big corporation. He stays at the hotel without the manager's. Cindy aka heroine. knowledge. HILARIOUS happenstances start on the first page and continue throughout the book. Cindy is hard working. lovable. and accident prone; but a good hotel manager. Eric (hero) is there to do a hatchet job on the hotel. he's crazy about the heroine and wants to pad the report. but does not. Chemistry is great between the H/h.... naturally needed in a good romance. and the humor is top notch. Great..Great..Read. I highly recommend this book and I thank Ms. Bond for the entertainment."
1,"I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily.  Once she tried it. there was no other alternative that worked as good for her (she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin. or left a rash).  This soaks in quickly. doesn't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night (she bumps into anything & a bruise starts. Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either doesn't happen or it fades away in a couple days).Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts. when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face (yes. just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large. angry acne marks are gone).This stuff works quickly on pain. doesn't stain. is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product."
3,"Some editing issues and odd word usage... also a little contrived and heavy handed in spots.That said. despited a feeling of redundancy. I very much enjoyed this bundle as well as the fourth book. Dark Wolf Rising.HOT! HOT! HOT! Even if most of it is all tease! lolThese stories definitely got my motor running.I liked the characters. and the sub-plot running throughout the four books (though it was less of a factor in the fourth book.)The resistance/aversion push/pull is an effective device but I would have liked a bit more variation. One slightly annoying feature was how often a character decided to &#34;Go for it&#34; only to NOT go for it shortly thereafter.Still... I enjoyed them."
4,"There is nothing 'real' or 'realistic' about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie. It is. quite simple. an orgiastic celebration of pain and suffering. See the bad guys sneer and laugh as the blood splatters their faces with full Dolby sound effects! In many ways the violence in 'Kill Bill' is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?). this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience. For the time capsule called. 'The Dumbing of America.' save room for this ridiculously overblown religious treatise that cheapens. not celebrates. the life of Christ. Pure drivel."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
4,"WOW this is a DVD?!?The show is as it was in the TV release and the extras do bring it to the modern day but I think they (Sony Wonder/Golden Books) could have packed all the shows on One DVD instead of making you buy  3 of them... Look to Warmer Bros. Year w/o Santa Claus...Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Frosty could have made it all in this DVD... Well I got it in the collection and saved some over buying them one at a time...Enjoy the show and worry where the popcorn money will come from later..."
5,"I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily. Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn't get tripped over or dinged. Enter the String swing.I have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble.The Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster. Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it's own center of gravity.The base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory. I didn't use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs.These are well worth the cost."
3,"This is the story of Devin. a skittish diva who is running from love and Erik. the man hell bent on chasing her crazy behind until she admits she loves him and is ready to move their relationship to the next level. I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin. afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived. is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest. most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries! Have your little black book handy. you might need to call in reinforcements LOL!!!"
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
8,"Ok So I have used this product for the past two months and it is not working. I don't know why. it appears to be in the exact same box as the one you would get from your local vet. I know it says it takes at most 18 hours to take affect. Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me. I am not happy about this at all. I only paid about $20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office. WHAT'S THE DEAL????Is this S*** fake ?????????????????I don't usually do reviews if the product is good. but when it is bad I do because I don't want anyone else wasting their money!!!JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS. For some unknown reason this just isn't working and I am frustrated."
10,"I don't know why I waited so long -- I purchased this to do my basement -- makes doing any sheetrock job -- especially ceilings -- exceedingly easier than doing it the old way with a cordlesss drill and dimpler bit.It takes a little practice to get used to how fast you can work with this. but even taking your time loading screws. it sets them at a perfect depth everytime which saves a HUGE amount of time in the long run when mudding.I'm holding back 1 star to see how well the tool holds up over time. but 25% of the way into my basement project. I'm extremely pleased with its performance."
11,"I am really enjoying playing this game. When I first heard about descent they were no longer in print. Later hearing about the second edition I was very excited.The production is excellent and the rules although a bit much at first are quite easy to learn. They are even easier to teach to someone. Weapons. spells and overload powers are really fun. The art work on the tile sets allows you to be fully taken into the experience.Games are also around an 1-2 hours and are nicely broken up into two acts for making it easier for groups with time constraints.If you are into dungeon board games. then his is for you."
11,"This game is really fun. and not that difficult to learn. Only takes a couple of games to figure it out. and the games are usually less than 30 minutes.The game is 2 player. and it has a defense / offense type strategy with the corporation being the defensive player trying to score agendas. and the hacker being the offense player trying to hack and steal the agendas. There is also an element of deck building.Very fun. would recommend buying some sleeves to protect the cards. Can't wait to check out the expansions."
11,"I like the Scene It games pretty much. The premise is similar to a Trivial Pursuit type of experience. but with 2 changes. One. all ages can play (with an older helper to read. use the remote. etc.) and two. the 'questions' sometimes involve watching a 'scene' (hence the name Scene It!!) and answering questions about that.The kids think that the dvd part is amazing! They love watching the scene and trying to guess what the question might be. I think it is kind of cool myself! Still. sometimes the game gets slightly long for younger children. My family does have fun playing this game. but it is one where you don't want to immediately play over again when it is done."
11,"This kit is really cool.  It comes with little tracer designs and a backup LED light so you can place all your parts where you want them and then trace your design.  Then you can finish up with cool colors. accents. details. etc.  You can make anything from a family SUV-type to a racecar to a Bug to everything in between.  My kid spent days taking personal requests and then lovingly designing a custom car for everyone in the family.  The final results are very high-quality too!  I definitely recommend this pack."
3,"I was not disappointed. sometimes sad. sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages. I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past. but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale. a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and can't wait to start on them. (I went for the freebies so don't know how the 3.00 plus books would be.) formating.english etc. may be better."
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
4,"Although I will never watch it again. I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie.  It accurately portrays Jesus' last tortured hours on planet earth.  I give kudos to Gibson. who was brave enough to finance this movie himself. amidst much controversy.  I would encourage all to watch this movie. at least one time. to understand why throughout the ages. thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ.Yes. this movie is violent. but this world is violent. and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world. but to share in our sufferings."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
8,"I have tried numerous bones and chew toys without success. My 90 lb Lab/Pit mix is a heavy chewer who has destroyed just about everything I gave him. Even the heavy rubber Black Kong Extreme he was able to conquer. I ordered the Galileo Bone based on many positive reviews. Initially I thought the price was high. $14.00 bucks for a dog bone? This thing is huge and will outlast 10 cheaper ones. My dog loved it! It has a chicken flavor that made it irresistible. He chewed it for over an hour straight barely making a mark in it. This bone will last a long time and is worth the price."
1,"Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!"
6,"FIrst. before you order these. pay attention to the dimensions listed in the description.  These are RETURN address labels -- the small ones you stick in the corner of the envelope -- NOT the usually-larger address labels that contain the address where you want your letter to go.  They are. therefore. SMALLER than address labels.  Don't order these expecting to get larger labels.  :-)That said. these are excellent quality. print easily in my inkjet printer. and. as the package says. are easy to peel off the backing sheet.  I used one of the templates I got from the Avery website (I'm on a Mac. using Microsoft Word for the Mac). and designed some nice-looking labels.  Don't expect to fit more than 3 lines of small print on each label.  Like I said. these are small."
10,"I bought the Bosch belt sander because. at the time. it had the best warranty. I planned to sand all the peeling paint off my 1 1/2 story clapboard house and repaint it. I thought that I'd go through at least two of these sanders. I bought the belts by the case and spent several weeks sanding the house. I'd run this thing until it overheated and stopped. I'd let it cool down and go at it again. To my surprise. I completed the job and the original Bosch sander was still working good as new. I later found out that this sander is good for more delicate work. I have more control and it seems to lay flatter. It eventually died (smoke poured out of the motor)and I replaced it with a Makita sander. a very robust and dependable unit. Over all. I'd prefer the Bosch for finer finishing work and ease of use."
6,"The best way to go with these business cards is to download the free Avery Design Pro software. Using this program. one can create a wide variety of business cards to satisfy virtually anyone.These cards do have a matte finish which is more conservative in appearance than the glossy or semi-glossy stock that is also available from Avery. They take color nicely and look very professional with their smooth edge.The cards break loose easily and dry quickly. It is usually wise to let them sit for a few minutes before stacking them.I am very pleased with the business cards that have been produced from this product and can recommend them to anyone wanting to exercise creativity in the design of their business cards."
9,"I think Casio under prices this watch. I have purchased watches from Nike and some of the other expensive brands and this Casio is still my favorite. The low profile makes it wearable every day. It says it is water resistant. but I have gone to the lake and swimming with this watch and never had any water issues. The back light is not as bright as some other brands but I am glad it is not because this helps the battery last longer and it is bright enough to see it. The watch is very user friendly for first timers. You can not beat a watch like this. especially when it is a quarter of the price of other watches."
11,"We got this for our family for Christmas and it was great. The game has a similar feel to Settlers. but isn't quite as cut-throat. so it's easier to get through a game without people feeling frustrated at each other. I can see why this game has won so many awards. I also love that it comes with three extra train pieces of each color so to account for pieces ever getting lost. The only thing we didn't like was that all the cards are very small (about 2 1/2&#34; tall) making it very hard to shuffle them)."
9,"First off. these amplify ALL sounds. so they are useless in a factory where there are constant noises echoing from a distance.When I walk on concrete. my FOOTSTEPS get isolated by these headphones. and the phones mute for almost a half second EVERY step. I cant even hear myself walk WITHOUT these on. They are hot and not exactly UNcomfortable. but you feel much better NOT wearing them.To top it off. I got it at the last GoldBox deal. and I was *NOT* sent the '7S' model I paid $99.99 for. I was sent this 6S model that retails for exactly $79 on Amazon. and I didnt notice until 5 weeks later."
10,"I mainly purchased these to replace the standard thrust washer that came with my tablesaw. So with that in mind. they work great.  As for the stabilizer part. I don't think they add much for standard kerf blades. or at least I don't notice any  appreciable difference.  I don't use thin kerf blades as a general rule so I can't speak to their usefulness while using thin kerf blades.I hadn't really intended on using both pieces when I ordered them. again intended to replace the thrust washer. One added benefit that I didn't think about is that it shifts the blade over. in my case. to the right.  Now I can reuse some of my old chewed up zero clearance inserts!I do only use the outside stabilizer with my dado set."
9,"I didn't buy the scope for the case or the stand I was looking for a good mid-range spotting scope that is what my review is for. I shoot 100yds. with a marlin wmr 22 and I can see my shots on paper very good.I also shoot a Savage axis at 200 yds. and can still see my holes in targer. for someone that does bird watching or simular hobbies this is a very good scope for the price. I could read the lettering on a building that was at least 1200 yds. away 12' letters."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"My Porter-Cable gets a lot of use and the pad will eventually loose it's &#34;grip&#34;.  When using the sander one should not use excessive pressure as I think this is the reason the pads will fail after about a year of heavy use.  Believe it or not. I get impatient and apply too much pressure which I believe develops excessive heat causing the velcro to fail.  When this happens. the sand paper will only loosely attach only to fly off.  Then it is time to put on a new one.  For the price of a replacement. I'll gladly fork over the dough to get away from the old stick backed sanding discs."
8,"Are you sick and tired of picking up slobbery. wet. drool dripping tennis balls? Then the answer to your problems is in the Chuck It. I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog. It's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground. It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it didn't just fly into the ground (I put too much arm swing into it). This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean. The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also. depending on the size of your dog. It also comes in a variety of colors. Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them!If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls. or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you!"
5,"This is actually the first capo I have ever owned. as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. That being said. I paid close to $14 with free shipping for this capo. and I feel it is a good value. It feels well constructed. like it won't break if I drop it. The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings. Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar's neck. The spring mechanism is plenty tight. but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed. even while playing. The capo is sleek looking. and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3&#34; x 3&#34;. but I have no frame of reference for comparison.Item was shipped on time. and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging. Part number: 83CB. Made in USA! No counterfeit here. If you have any questions. feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO"
6,"If the size is very important for you. check the photo of the box first. The description by Amazon lists these as 1-1/4. however the box actually lists 1-1/16.Even then. really the usable size is closer to just 1'.We needed super large clips at the office. and measured that 1-1/4 would be just perfect. however with the actual usable bit measuring in at 1'. we're having some problems making them work.Granted. they do work great. but the item description was misleading online. and the actual stated capacity is also stretching it a little.Durability is great as usual. though unusual warping may occur due to the larger size. Harder to open to the full 1' size."
9,"This is great for baking it just takes some getting used to.  Cookies and turnovers get over cooked unless turned.As for the reviewers who complain about the handle getting hot.  Just buy the lodge signature series with stainless handles (it only costs 5 to 10x as much) or buy a good oven mitt or two.Obviously several of the reviewers are illiterate as they didn't read the care instructions.  But to be fair Lodge doesn't say that you really need to boil water in the pan and then wpie with oil and heat before using.  The pre-seasoning only shortens the seasoning process. it DOES NOT REPLACE SEASONING!"
4,"ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has beendeemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to seemalice where none exists.Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows ofthose with the same mentality as the book-burners of1930's Germany.Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian 'Newsspeak' toedit our past? Come on... this IS a cartoon. for Pete'ssake. NOT some social/political statement.Nothing here needs to be edited or 'cleaned up'. Theseare simple 'good vs. evil' stories with a happy ending.and should be offered in their entirety... music/songs.credits and all.And. if one is offended by ANY of this... then one mayexorcise one's freedom NOT to purchase such!Nuff' said..."
1,"I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again. we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them. definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!"
10,"This product is almost exactly the same as the Ryobi BE231 it replaced. Externally the primary difference is a carbon pad to reduce frction on the Bosch. The Bosch cost twice as much. and became nonfunctioinal after little use. while the Ryobi model withstood heavy use for years. There was so much friction on the carbon pad. that it heated up painfully. The sander started breaking belts for no apparent reason. The dust collection on the Ryobi was not good. but it was totally nonfunctional on the Bosch.I have been satisfied with the Bosch routers (1613.1617). but their sanders. both belt and ROS. have not worked well for me."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
9,"All natural. does not polute. no chemicals on your skin. all natural. So natural you can brush your teeth with it! It has been a favorite of us backpackers for years and only a few drops will usally do the job. I have tried the Almond. Citrus. Eucalyptus.Tea Tree. and Peppermint. My favorite is the Peppermint which leaves you tingling and smells great. and taste's allot better than the others for brushing your teeth. If used right a bottle will last a very. very. long time. You can also wash clothes. dishes. whatever. with it. There are several stories about it and its creator on the web. A peculiar history for a great product. that is still made by the same family operation.I started by just using it for backpacking and now get it to use at home too."
3,"I loved this shorter story about Zadist. Bella and Nalla. I had no idea that they were having troubles in their marriage. I couldn't believe that things almost didn't work out for them. My heart was breaking for Bella and Nalla. and Zadist too because of everything that he was going thru. It's like a normal every day marriage - there was lack of communication and I was so happy that during the read they were able to figure out what they needed to figure out. talk about what they needed to talk about. and work it out. Oh I just love the whole series and can't wait for March 2013. Once again J R Ward outdid herself with this short story about the now happy lil perfect family!"
4,"I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT!!!!"
11,"THis game only got 4 due to the luck factor.  No matter how well you play. you could just draw bad cards everytime.  That is it.  Other than that. this is a wonderful. wonderful game.  This IS the perfect game to get people into Eurogames like Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.  Easy to explain - 5 minutes tops.  Fast to play - 1 hour.  Good strategy.  Good theme.  You even feel like you are being educated at least a little bit in the area of US geography.Bottom Line:  Best family board game in existance.  Anyone can learn to play it relatively quickly."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows. I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product.  My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it.  In a last ditch attempt. I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral.  Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly (and yes. I am a lady)and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now.  You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated.  My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have.  I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up.  It also doesn't dry out my skin like other products.  Definitely a keeper!"
3,"Esme is abused by her father after her mother leaves them.  Seeking a way out she is going to marry until she realizes the man is just as awful (and as old as) her father.  When she witnesses the scene across the street she decides that Captain Radwell is the man to ruin her and get her away from her father.  What she doesn't count on is the honorable streak that he is trying to have.  He delivers her to his brother and his wife for help.  And then he sticks around.  Great read!"
5,"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop. the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway. I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack. don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise. I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!"
10,"Bought a box of this to go with my PC 343 sander. Don't make the same mistake as I did. The PC 343 is 8 hole. This sandpaper is 5 hole!But other than my mistake in ordering it. I have used it with the PC343 and it sands and sands and sands! The paper is heavyweight and last a lot longer than what I was using with my C-backed 3M sander. Picks up dust reasonably well considering I am only using approx 2 or 3 out of the 5 holes. Probably the best sand paper I have used in a long time.Price is alright if you are buying just one box. I have found suppliers selling it for $16 for all grits. If plan on getting several boxes or the higher grits. it is available from other online suppliers for $16 a box (Plus $6 shipping). Just do some surfing. you may get better deals from time to time with store promotions."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
11,"Unlike a lot of games I've gotten for my daughter. Qwirkle was one I was not familiar with from having playing it as a child. Not sure if it was around back then. or if it's just a modern version of a classic concept (like dominoes perhaps?). All I know is that I love playing it and so does my almost-six year old daughter. And the cool thing is we can each play at our own level and still play together. I don't have to &#34;dumb down&#34; my playing at all. And she never has to feel like I'm letting her win. Her moves have surprised and challenged me just as often as the other way around. Not many games like that. are there? Highly recommend."
4,"This sensational DVD. culled from a TV show I have cloudy memories of from my youth. presents Andy Kaufman in a way that surpasses the Milos Forman biopic (not to denigrate Jim Carrey's outstanding performance) and the  A&amp;E Biography. You get it all here. and it's mostly hilarious. Best of  all is Mr. Kaufman's dead-on Elvis impersonation...his choice of songs is  impeccable--&quot;Too Much&quot; is an Elvis hit that Mr. Presley seldom  performed live. Great introduction (or reintroduction?) to this fascinating  character."
11,"I appreciate the materials used to create this puzzle and our three year-old loves the picture that is formed when the puzzle is complete. Soy inks + recycled cardboard = Wonderful.I have only one criticism. and it's a minor one. Since the puzzle is intended for a younger audience. it might be nice if the pieces were a bit thicker. Our son has good fine motor skills. but the pieces can still bend and crease as he works to fit them together. With that said however. the creasing may be due more to his impatience when the pieces don't seem to fit right than with the build quality of the puzzle."
10,"This tool does everything the manufacture says it does and does it well.  No wonder many magazines have made it their &quot;Editor's Choice&quot;.I don't understand the negative reviews.  I have experienced none of the problems some people have mentioned.  Maybe a person needs to be smarter than the tool.  I make my living with a plate joiner doing plastic laminate countertops and it has been flawless.  I've used tools costing much more with no improvement in results.The only place I might take away a half star would be since the fence is so precise you wouldn't want to turn it over to an employee who would drop it on a concrete floor.  Other than that I don't know how you would improve upon it."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
10,"Product works as advertised but  the run-down test on a new Lithium battery was a bit disappointing.  With frequent power outages. I want a light that will last a long time.  I turned around and purchased the LED bulb kit and resolved this as an issue.The provided bulb's brightness was mildly disappointing.  The LED is brighter but does not throw as wide a beam.But if you add the cost of the floodlight ($35) + LED kit ($25) . it's a bit pricey."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
3,"As a stand-along book. I really enjoyed The Twelve Lies of Christmas. although it didn't have as much of a holiday theme as the title would indicate.The main characters were engaging. if a bit under-developed and the story was fast-paced and kept my interest throughout the story. The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series. I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand. I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha. I can't imagine that their lives would become less exciting that they started in this book."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
5,"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal. it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot. so I had that replaced. but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product. but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had."
1,"This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this."
1,"While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands. I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience. as it depends what you use them for. but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year. so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand."
8,"This 'wiggly giggly' ball was very disappointing.  I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective. which of course amazon was quick to replace.  The second one came and was no better than the first one.  It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person. but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog. it went mute.  He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back.  I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $12. I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball."
3,"The WSJ for Kindle is overpriced. and the customer service has gone completely haywire since the newspaper was bought out.  I have read and subscribed by Kindle. print edition. and iPhone app (WSJ Mobile).  Unfortunately. they are all horrible in contebt delivery--even though the writing is still superb--and try calling them.  10 minute waits to speak to someone in a different country who will put you on hold. and then when you try to cancel. it is abysmal.  More waiting.  I will never be part of WSJ Online. pinrt. Mobile or Kindle after my recent experiences.  Again. the company has been bought out and is now on its way out.  Beware."
8,"Ok. I don't own this. but have thought about it. After discovering arm and hammer cat box deodorizer...I can live without the littemaid. I buy cheap litter because I've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage. I keep the box. garbage bags. the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer. I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter. Try this. if you are leary of buying the litter maid.  I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing!"
1,"Bought 3 packs. prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each. but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW. it is true that the description is misleading. the batteries I received are alkaline. not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices. but for toys and flashlights. alkaline is a better value."
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
5,"Ever since I started playing the guitar. I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with. but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them. as you can get them at your local music store for about that."
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
6,"The Swingline Classic Cut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer is exactly what it says. it's LIGHT. and it cuts very well.  The lightness of the product does make it feel a bit cheap. but I think it will hold up just fine....it's a desktop item. not something you're going to throw around or jump on!There are two sets of measuring guides. on at the top of the cutter and another about 5 inches down which is kind of nice. the entire bed of the cutter it filled with grids so it's easy to make sure that your paper is lined up straight. very useful for cutting smaller items.I am very happy with this cutter. a great replacement for my old heavy elephant of a cutter. definitely worth it!"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
4,"What an encouraging story!  With all the odds against him. Dr. Carson came out on top with his faith and the teaching and prayers of his Mom.  If you are a single parent. I highly recommend this movie as a great source of inspiration.  The positive impact of a parent is so dramatically displayed.And if you are into details. be sure to watch the 'extra' information on the making of the movie.  It will really add to your appreciation of Dr. Carson and those who worked so hard to bring his story to life."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
5,"I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough. I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done. this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings. I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
11,"I purchased this game after watching it played on Tabletop on the Geek and Sundry youtube channel.  It can be a little daunting when you first set it up but is easier to play than it looks. I really like that it supports up to 8 players as we have a large group of friends that game together. It can be hard to find good quality games that support more than 4-6 players and many of the ones that do can become tedious waiting for your turn.On our first time playing we got our butts kicked. but we still had a great time."
5,"I never really considered a cheaper cable. I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon. I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise. this is an excellent cable. with good build quality and a strong. thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables. and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm. guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over. try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!"
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
5,"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge. then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most. and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke. and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own. just make sure to not let the sponge drip. ie. wring it out. and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
8,"Shipping was fast. got it within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  Says that it stops all stages of fleas. and kills and protects against chewing lice and ticks as well - I'm not sure about the chewing lice and ticks. but I did find fleas on my Lab puppy when I got him.  I use this on him. and within two weeks I didn't find any on him at all. not even after I bathe him and used a flea comb on him.  Says it works up to a month. and is water-proof.I'd highly recommend."
9,"When I considered returning the compass for smaller ones. I learned that Amazon does not accept returns for this item due to hazardous material regulations.  Not a problem in my case. but thought you'd all want a heads-up before purchasing.I purchased a few of these as additions to emergency kits I built for friends/family (see my Listmania lists).  I planned to make the kits out of Nalgene bottles. but the compass is a little too wide to fit. so instead I made the kits out ofMTM Survivor Dry Box with O-Ring Sealwhich worked out better anyway."
11,"I'll keep it pretty short. If you're considering the expansion. I would hope you already own Last Night on Earth. I think LNOE is a great game that offers suspense. teamwork. competition. and usually a lot of laughs. This expansion does not change much. What it does do is add some more locations (in the form of some new L-shaped boards). some new characters. new hero and zombie cards. and a few new scenarios. On top of that. it comes with new game pieces that are used with the free scenarios available on the games' official website or that can be used to design your own scenarios.In short. this expansion does not reinvent the wheel. What it will do. however. is help expand and reinvigorate an already great game. It's a little pricey. but if you like LNOE. it's a good investment."
9,"this lock is useless on my glock and shotgun and only barely fits very awkwardly on my sig sauer.  it does fit on my ruger revolver but barely too.  it is bulky and you're better off getting a small lock box instead of this.  it may sound good until you try in on and it doesn't fit or barely fit. not to mention it may scratch up the gun.  this claims to fit many or most guns but it doesnt fit the popular ones out there like the ones i have.  what's worse is that the 3rd digit on the combo gets stuck and is difficult to move.  that would totally render this lock totally useless.  it doens't fit and if it does fit it would take you forever just to roll the digits over to your code to unlock it!  overrated lock."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
8,"I adopted Sam from a local shelter.  He had a dull. brittle coat. constant rash and other health issues.  I had him allergy tested and found he was allergic to some 40 foods and environmental allergens.  The allergy testing places compiled a list of dog foods he could eat.  All were expensive ($60+ for a 30lb bag) and hard to find where I live in rural Alaska.  But we love our dogs up here and I found that I could get Avoderm on Amazon for a hair over $40 for a 30lb bag with free shipping.  I haven't made my postman happy. but my dog loves it and I love the price and ease.  Sam can't have potatoes. peas. and a lot of grains. so Avoderm has really changed his life and mine.  Thanks Amazon!"
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"Double bladed. my only gripe is the blade's a tad short. Most manufacturers of great knives don't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges. but SOG. The characteristics of this knife make it a good fighting knife. but a little on the smallish side. Take a look at the Cold Steel Voyager with a 5- or 6-inch blade for not a whole lot more money. Chances are you'll drop this one in a heartbeat.Free shipping on knives would be great. too. but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales. At least on smaller items."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it. I hadn't noticed that in the listing. maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable. my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle. good as new. I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit. I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days. Works a charm on acoustic guitars. haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet."
5,"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works. and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele. and it is easy to add. move. remove. With the trigger-type release. it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards. and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo. Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality. this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended."
9,"Love it love it  love it.I've been needing a camping knife for a while. I already owned several SOG products and have found them to be an acceptable balance of price and quality. This product is no exception. Are their better? Of course! But there are much worse for much more money. as well. THis is an excellent value for an excellent blade that I expect to last forever. Or.  until I give it away / lose it/ abuse it to disrepair. This buy is a no-brainer for anyone in the market for a similar sized blade.The only thing I may--- MAY - have changed. was going for the kydex rather than nylon.... but I do like that the extra storage in the nylon version is perfect for a sharpener or my SOG multitool."
9,"This set is good for the office - and if you have carpet. it would help if you attach some velcro at the ends to make the mat straight. Otherwise the mat is my biggest complaint - it does not straighten out enough. The return mechanism is pretty good. the unit itself feels fairly cheap. My 7 and 10 year olds enjoy it. even set some obstacles to make the course more interesting.As far as using it in the office. I had a few bosses who like to &#34;practice&#34; at the office. and this would be a winner for a birthday gift."
8,"Bought this for our 50-pound dog. for use following surgery. to reduce the risk of post-op hernia.  Trained him on it prior to surgery. since he's used to jumping in and out of the van.  Dog navigated it just fine. even in post-anesthesia haze :-).  Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table.  All surfaces are coated. so there's nothing to scratch the vehicle's paint.  When folded. ramp kept closed with a coil spring. protected with a bit of clear tubing.  Simple solution that works just fine.  Notch in rails well-placed to carrying when folded.  Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp.  Definitely recommend to dog friends."
4,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend in the theaters as soon as it came out.  This is not really a very religious movie. but rather describes the last 12 hours of Jesus before he was crucified.  The content of the movie is very strong though.  Throughout the whole movie. I was bothered by how many times Christ was punished...was just in about every other scene!  I think. that the director(s) abused a little of the punishment. but that's my opinion.  We didn't get to live those times to find out how it really was. but it was very hard. lots of punishment and suffering.It shows clearly all the suffering Jesus went through. and how he stayed strong the whole way.  Like another reviewer mentioned. the Satan character and deamons that haunt Judas were well done.Overall. the movie is very good. with lots of strong & violent scenes and sad moments as well. Go watch it and/or buy it and renew your faith!"
10,"A well engineered product released after they 'got the bugs' out.  Doesn't sound very American.  Jorgensen has a well known reputation and they seem to want to maintain it.  The metal is clean. all parts align and the size and weight are a good mix for most applications.I would only suggest two additional things.  The handle's end caps don't fit well (sometimes).  Do not force them on or they will split.  Lightly taper the handle and either screw. glue or do both. 'J' could send 3 to avoid user problems.  Secondlyly. I would like to 'J' supply a pair of hard wood inserts for the steel jaws.  TJS"
4,"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it. thinking it was a film. not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals. you risk being burned at the stake. an act of love to purify your soul.This film.as a film. disregarding the topic. is a dog. A cheap 'B' grade. blood spurting. flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour. but won't bother."
9,"These don't last long if you sharpen a good deal.  After a couple of months a significant amount of the grit is gone and you have to start seeking good spots on the sharpener. usu. top and bottom.  Same with my Lansky fine sharpener. When the grit goes. the holes (on either) start catching the edge--not good.  Still. even quality stones wear. and as I said. I just bought my 3rd one in 3 years. so there must be something right about it.  Basically. it is quick. gets a good--not great--I use Japanese water stones for my best knives--edge. Frequently. I have had friends admire whatever knife I am carrying and pull theirs out and this enables me to put a quick. easy edge on their blades and hand it back to them. tickled."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
9,"The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad.  Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize.  The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft.  The unit just doesn't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose."
1,"In general. Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox. and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming. i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these. I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case. I will continue to buy online."
5,"At the begining I wasn't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this. so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box. I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals. then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain. so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise!. connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine. I also realized that pedals positions (routing signal) has something to do with it. I couldn't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right. so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it. so it work as it is supposed to."
11,"I'll admit. I like it. we have a 4 and 6 year old and they ate it up.  It made Christmas really fun this year.  Some drawbacks:  1) I got tired of telling them to be good because the elf would tell Santa (do not let this replace real parenting).2) If you are a Christian like I am. you will need to bring the real message of Christmas into this story or it will overshadow it.3) Don't forget to move the thing every night!  Sheesh. my kids thought the elf didn't move because they were so bad the day before. the elf couldn't bear to tell Santa."
1,"They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year. the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite. in the manual that comes with the weather station. recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite. we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far. the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life. except to say that it's at least a year. at least for our type of use."
3,"I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults.  Warning it is a long. involved tale that can't be read in one evening.  Since every character is a man. it is a less than sentimental journey.  Though they are definitely some tearful scenes.  One character is a former slave. but is treated as the others' equal though somewhat condescendedly.  I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone.  And no spoilers. but you may want to read another Verne classic when done with this one..."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
6,"I absolutely love these mailing labels!  They are convenient. and make life so much easier!  These mailing labels are smaller than certain other types of labels; therefore. more labels will fit on each sheet.  And if you use a lot of mailing labels. then that does you a lot of good.They print so quickly and easily.  Whenever you need a label. just peel it off.  These label sheets save a lot of time and energy. and are so neat.Highly recommended if you use mailing labels.And these are for ink jet printers. which is the type of printer I have at home."
11,"I bought this on a whim to play with my D&D; friends when we don't have enough players for our regular game.  It is enjoyable and novel as a result of the clear card format.  The art is interesting and the flavor text on teh cards is great.  I recommend.The loss of the fifth star is largely the result of the cost and the quality of the cards.  My set is a little bit cloudy and they have gotten moderately less clear with minimal use.I also bought the expansion and made identical comments there as well."
1,"First. you don't buy specialized bandages like this very often. I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones. yikes! The adhesive - able to stick for days (thru showers). the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material. the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed. Latex-free and hypoallergenic (I've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids. not just the latex). This stuff blows away other (more recent) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it. Except my surgical tape isn't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes?"
6,"Generally. my main complaint about labels is the poor quality glue that's used and their inability to stick to anything other than a narrow range of paper types. Most Avery labels can stick to a wide variety of materials ranging from paper to pained surfaces to plastic and these are no exception.As advertised. they are very opaque and anything underneath will generally not show through. If you hold the label up to the light. you might be able to make out what was underneath--but otherwise you can't see through it.They feed through printers without issue (even color lasers that may snake the labels through several rollers) and peel of cleanly.Do you need Avery labels for everything? No. not really. But you are definitely getting a better product for the money."
1,"I'm lucky. these are 'cheap' and work great for me; I eat a lot of dairy!I usually eat between one and three with my first bites of dairy. occasionally I've made a mistake and taken after. never have had a problem. knock on wood -funny thing. I live on a dairy farm. and I can drink our raw milk just fine. I need lactaid to eat our aged cheeses and pasteurized milk. I have not tried raw milk ice cream. and our yogurt is fine for me. all yogurt is fine for me ...I'm delighted I can buy this through Amazon. hard to get locally ..."
4,"Did Mel want do resell this video or was it because he wanted the art to speak for itself. then over time say his part?I didn't even know this was out until someone on the radio was discussing watching it. It seems like there was always a 'making of' planned for the DVD but with the controversy surrounding the film. it seems like he put this on the shelf until time had passed by.There was little to no promotion regarding this special edition as I mentioned. so I don't think this was about reselling as it is giving the fans of this film what they want.Time has passed to be able to watch the film. listen to the commentary and now get a peek behind the curtain.Braveheart is still my favorite of his though."
6,"I love making my own greeting cards.  These work perfectly with my canon inkjet printer.I like to take tons of pictures at parties and get togethers.  It is amazing how many funny looking faces some people make while trying to smile for a photo especially a big group.  There will always be one in the middle of doing something else instead of getting the smile right.  I like to take and isolate that one and later for their birthday or something make a funny card.  Or put funny sayings in word balloons over their heads and make a funny card.People like personalized cards and not only that. this is so much cheaper than cookie cutter cards at the store.  My friends all seem to look forward to my cards so I use lots of these Avery Half Fold products."
10,"I've used this for about six months now.  For the price I am satisfied. But you get what you pay for. It required at least an hour to true the sole. clean the paint from certain areas and sharpen the blade. And the blade doesn't seem to hold an edge for a long time. I think I'll ask Santa to put a Lie Neilsen in my stocking this year. For the weekend warrior. this is probably the perfect plane. But beware. the blade needs to be sharpened before use."
1,"I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold. my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it's a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However. for some reasons. it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don't have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning. wash it off by the afternoon. and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face. it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes. shine. oily looking. However. if you don't care too much about your appearance. it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh. did I mention that the price is very reasonable?"
9,"I have an older one and I have to agree with the flaws cited by other reviewers.  The hard plastic wheels are slippery. make an annoying grinding sound. and they ride rough.  The handle is way too short.  I have to hunch over to hold it.  Other less significant problems: the foot rest is too narrow so my 1 year old just drags his feet (2 year old can peddle or push with his feet fine).  The best thing about it is the low seat height (1 year old can climb on easily. not so with Radio Flyer).  It's also not expensive like the otherwise much better-made Kettler.  Between this and the Radio Flyer. we're set until it's time for real bicycles.  Trikes do tip.  I think that's how boys get tough. no?  or at least more careful."
6,"Overall. I'm very satisfied with these.  I originally had thought I'd use them for individual labeling of mail. however. my software doesn't allow for single print of labels.  So. I initially wasted an entire sheet when the address printed on all the labels.So. I've gone to using them for my return labels.  I use a Canon M83 color printer and they come out just fine.  I will say that 'virtually disappear' is a pretty big stretch...to me the labels are still very visible even though they are clear."
9,"Perfect soap for me. It doesn't dry out my skin. its hypoallergenic. it is biodegradable so I can use it while backpacking. it has tons of freaky pseudo-cult stuff written all over it for shower time reading. what more could you want? No weird fragrances means that it is basically just castile soap mixed with peppermint oil. The peppermint oil can be a bit jarring on really cold winter mornings. but it is completely amazing after working out. When you are trying to cool down after a workout. the peppermint oil is so. so nice.Recommend for anyone who likes simple refreshing soap?"
8,"Our German Shepherd. Gabby. is so energetic when we give her these. which is every morning. She does prefer the roasted beef Zuke's better. but loves these. also. The vim and vigor that she gets from these are unbelievable and she is very peppy after consuming the recommended amount. I think highly of this product and believe that the ingredients make a huge difference in the well being of our pup! She is happier. springier. and does not act like an old lady. like she used to! Awesome stuff!!"
9,"I've been using Dr. Bronner's for many decades. It's my favorite camping soap. but is a refreshing wash-up anywhere. I use it to freshen water bottles too. It gets rid of that funny plastic taste and smell. Larger quantities are cheaper than the smaller bottles you might find at your local mountainously overpriced sports stores. I gave it four stars because I do prefer the original formula that was stronger and left a size-able tingle on your skin. but even toned down it's a great soap. I'll continue to buy it."
4,"This one totally bites.  Unless you were born in the 40's this one is completely out of date.  No bite no bang and way too much buck.  The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room.  Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers.  Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot.  If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride.  That's a biker flick.  This is yet another example of how phony the 60's were.  Save your money.  I wish I had."
6,"This is the one.  This is the first all-in-one keyboard cleaning kit I have ever used that really delivers.  The instructions are clear and the tools are high quality.  After using the cleaner for the first time I was amazed that my keyboard (a Logitech ergonomic) looked and felt brand new after I had used dirty fingers to pound out thousands of pages on it.  Don't even bother with searching for another kit.  There is one thing though.  There should be about twice as much of the cleaning solution provided."
3,"I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut. fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author. Mr Camacho. made Hannibal a very human hero. who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!"
11,"Since it was high on the list of popular games at the major gaming convention in Germany. and it was a worker placement game (my favorite mechanic). I was very excited to finally get this new game. Not disappointed at all!! The theme is so fun (elves. dwarves and gnomes). it is easy to learn. and the depth is very good. You can make it easy to play or more difficult. depending on a few simple modifications on the board. I would say it's medium to light-heavy for strategy. I got this game about two weeks ago and have already played it six times. So happy I got it. If you like games like Le Havre. Agricola. or Calyus. you will probably like this game as well. Enjoy!"
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
6,"This notebook paper isn't the best that I've used. It's still pretty nice though. It's a little on the thin side but It fits nicely in a binder. The only advantage I can think of for this thin paper is that your notebook won't be so heavy! I also wondered if the thickness of the paper meant that ink would go right though. I checked that with my runniest pen. which is a Pentel gel pen and am glad to say that the ink does not bleed through. The wide ruled paper is perfect for some children that write bigger. Other than that. the paper has no other flaws and works nicely as notebook paper."
10,"I bought this handy contraption because the Bosch brand has never let me down. It's just the tool for cutting wood trim and  does a great job on PVC pipe. too. Plus. this saw has all the features I value. I like using it freehand to square off or flush cut studs and rafter projections when prepping for drywall in my half remodeled 1930's vintage home. It can reach into places where getting a handsaw is impossible. It has a variable speed dial that lets you match the tool to the material. It's a shame it doesn't come with a blade for metal cutting. I don't use this tool as much as some of my other Bosch products. like my Progressor jigsaw. but it sure is great to have on hand. Never know just when you'll need it. Thanks. Amazon!"
11,"I bought this set for a 13 year old girl who is a friend of the family because she loves fashion. She spent the afternoon putting together a fashion line. The ribbons. sequins. beads. and 'fabrics' (paper) come in such a large variety of lovely choices I couldn't resist joining in. This would be an excellent gift for an older child in the hospital. travelling. or simply to pass a rainy weekend. There is so much paper included and choices with the stencils that this book provides a great deal of playtime."
10,"These blades cut great.  Nice clean cut on veneered products such as the side of a cabinet. etc.  Only downside. and maybe it's just with my Festool jigsaw. when ran at high speeds (cutting) these blades make the worst high pitched noise you've ever heard.  I can't even explain the sound but if you don't plug your ears it will literally make you brain dead.  You can feel your ear drums resonating in your head!  And again. maybe it's just my saw or my ears but it's painful.  If I am only making a 5&#34; cut with this blade I will literally walk off the job site to my truck and get my ear plugs.  It's that bad.  Other than that the blades cut great!"
3,"I love On the Edge! Meeting Brett. Leo and Lisa through the out of the box series made me want to know soo much more about these characters. If you haven't read the out of the box set. On the edge is a great introduction to what you will get a whole lot more of in the rest of the series. HOT scenes between the trio. and the different combinations of duos too. I just reread the story again. and the second time around it is still as good as the first... now seriously thinking about reading the rest of them again too :P I love the personalities. and they all play off of each other in great ways. Thanks Kallysten for continuing to keep me aroused. entertained. and eagerly awaiting what ever series instalment you have coming out next. :)"
5,"Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me. so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine. Seemed no matter how I tried. I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitar.It seems that &#34;C&#34; shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings. and I find that is better done by hand. So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature.  And the string winder itself also works well."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
5,"I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!"
4,"The Visual Bible Gospel of Matthew is excellent.  I love the acting and the way the Bible comes to life through the word for word script.  I found it very inspiring and helpful.  My four daughters and I have watched 'Matthew' numerous times and it always is benefitial.  I especially like the happiness that Jesus portrays.  We know he drew people to him. and the actor in this video has appropriate expressions and whatnot which make him very appealing.  Throughout the Gospel he is not always happy. of course. but is appropriate to the situations. happy. sad. angry. distressed. etc...  Jesus was very human. and this is apparent in this Visual Bible Matthew.  Jesus was also divine. and God's love shows through as well.  I really highly recommend this Visual Bible. Gospel of Matthew.Thanks!"
11,"Ihad my doubts at first.  Let's face it. when someone says &#34;Let's play monopoly.&#34; the first thing you think of is Oh no! a long boring game.  Well. that was my first impression when my husband suggested buying the game.  Totally changed my mind from the very first time we played the game.  We have family night and couples night with this game.  It is fun and worth the investment.  I know it's a little on the higher end of cost but it is lots of fun."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal. you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount. if necessary) and more tone control. but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range."
1,"I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it. not exactly a rave review but definitely a 'thumbs up'.Cheers"
4,"When I was just a little boy. my heart was filled with glee whenever my friend Underdog appeared on my TV.  From lovable. humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound. no better television show for childhood could be found.  Now that I am older. I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV.  This Collector's Set Edition. so carefully restored. can once again be purchased. to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew. ages four and six. just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks.  I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime.  So let's lift a toast to Underdog. a hero for all time. and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme."
11,"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play. it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat. but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win. until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature."
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
11,"I have never played 1st edition of Descent but always wanted to. Sadly. the time to play a game of descent was said to spread from 3-6 hours. Now. second edition comes out and it can easily be played within 1-3 hours. On top of that there are 16 quests to go on! I love how Fantasy Flight Games come out with great games and never skimp out on the quality. This is a great game for players who were always curious about Descent. it plays well and the instructions are easily learned. I would highly recommend the Conversion kit as well. This adds more monsters and heroes into your game. but does not include the miniatures. Love this game!"
10,"if you are like me and not ready to spend [money]on a dado set. look no further.  this baby performs.  i chose the 6' for my 10' delta contractors saw. i believe this is wise to compensate for the lower horsepower of my saw.  a smaller blade will have more rpm's than an 8' or 10'. its physics.  anyway. i like the case to keep it all organized and it comes with a handy guide that tells you what chippers and shims to use for certain cuts.  quite handy for undersized plywood.  big carbide tips that look like they will stand up to several sharpenings.so why did i only give it 4 stars?  someone at freud  just got off break on friday just before quitting time and shorted me an 1/8' chipper. Quality control cost ya a star Freud."
9,"After discovering the possible dangers of traditional soap and shampoo. I was recommended Dr. Bronners by a co-worker. I received it without realizing you can basically use it for anything. not just shampoo and soap. I've used Dr. Bronners for shower soap and shampoo. for washing my hands. for shaving. and for even cleaning a sink. Rumor has it you can even use it for mouth wash and/or brushing your teeth. I am not 100% sure if that's true. but it is a rumor. Try at your own risk.The smell of Dr. Bonners is great and even though it's expensive for a small amount. it &#34;lathers&#34; really well. You only need a dab of this stuff to clean a wide area of whatever you are cleaning. It doesn't leave your hair/skin dry like traditional soap and shampoo can sometimes do. It makes you smell great for a while after using it. Highly recommended to traditional soap and/or shampoo."
5,"The shell and the lining of the case are perfect: hard on the outside. and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap. and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I'm not traveling around with my guitar too much. so that's not a problem for me. but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise. it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches."
1,"Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner. and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great. however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads. I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"Well folks this saw is the best I have ever owned . I chose this one over the nonsliding variant soley for versatility . I can bounce from framing to trim with no extra work beyond flipping the crown stops .The stock 60 tooth blade is adequate for most work but for delicate ornate trim I use a series 40 ( 96 tooth blade ). I have had my saw for about 3 months and I love not doing the old ' upside down and backwards ' technique .If anyone wants to see some pics . ask and I'll email you asap.I have used it on wood .poly. and foam crown with great results.  Tom"
4,"I enjoyed the message David tries to portray and have respect for what he is trying to tell us. I am disappointed in his presentation.  Our family home schools our children and we were hoping to be able to use the series to educate our children about the christian message.  The American Heritage Series is basically just a long lecture. Its an unpolished narrated lecture that makes history boring like they do in many classrooms.  David is like the expert professor who puts his class to sleep because of presentation. I rate him 3 stars. Actually an average of 5 stars for content and 1 star for presentation."
4,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie! We have three different movie portrayals of Jesus Christ. which are completely consistent with their respective Gospels. and we enjoy all of them. (Read my other reviews if you're interested in them.)The happy. laughing Jesus in this movie is intriguing. The way he speaks to people and looks at them warmly portrays his love for everyone. I think the actor really does a great job of portraying the duality of Jesus. how much he loves us. but yet that all is not hearts and flowers and warm and fuzzy due to the human condition.If you're looking for a great movie to share with friends. family. small group. etc.. this is it! Don't watch late at night because you'll want to stay awake!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
5,"If you need it. good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated. this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument. since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap. Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price."
1,"I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise. a strange place. and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room. it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic. elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road. this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby. sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car. driven round and round and round and....)"
11,"This is the basic Fluxx card game that will change your ideas about 'rules.' There really aren't any set rules in Fluxx. That's why it's called Fluxx (though I have quickly learned this can also be used as a cuss word.) The rules are constantly changing. as are the ways in which you can win. so you can kiss any sense of strategy goodbye! You simply have to go with the flow and luck of the draw. The only thing that can ruin the fun of this fast changing game is the eventual winner. The more they gloat. the less you'll want to play."
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
9,"Today I bought the second of this scooter. The first I had bought last summer and was great. It's seen a lot of use. and a fully grown adult has put it through its paces without issue.Tonight I bought another one. and it's going back to the store immediately. The problem with it is that the handlebar tube is jammed and very stiff. There's no way a child could adjust this. since I estimate I had to apply well over 100 lbs of force with my foot against the foot area while pulling very strongly against the handle bars to get even 10&#34; of extension. I'm unable to pull it out further. The handlebar is just hopelessly jammed into the tube. so back to the store it goes.Too bad. as the rest of it continues to seem fairly bulky and lots of shiny metal everywhere."
1,"I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks. it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size. though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet. the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!"
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
4,"Blows the door open on Socialism for all to see.  We always suspected that something was not quite right behind the facade of the Soviet 'peoples paradise' and this film confirms it.  Some images are not for the faint of heart but are heart rending  in the brutality displayed. This film should be curricula in High Schools across North America.  Maybe then we could put this fascination and obsession about the glory of Communism to rest once and for all.  The survivor interviews were particularly touching.  Only a heartless b**tard or a devout Socialist / Communist could fail to be moved by the emotion on display.  A must see to fully appreciate the democracy we all enjoy."
4,"I first started reading the Mandie books when I was twelve.  Needless to say. I'm more than twice that age now.  So it was quite a delight for me when I stumbled across this movie at Blockbuster.  I had no idea they were making Mandie movies. I'm so glad to see it!  I thought this movie did a fairly accurate portrayal of Mandie and her kin.  I really enjoyed the Cherokee personalities.  And I thought Dean Jones as Jason Bond was especially good.  Uncle John was well portrayed by a dapper young gentleman.  And in essence. the movie was darling and very likeable.  The single and only reason I don't rate it a five star movie is because I thought the almost comedic style of acting in the movie detracted from what could have been a very serious and successful story line.  Other than that. I really enjoyed this movie."
8,"I had this for less than three days. The first day it was great.  I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine.  The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat.  Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated.  Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors.  Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement.  I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly.  Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter.  Within an hour the towel was saturated.  Luckily I bought it at Walmart.  Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap.  They put it aside to be reshelved.  I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it."
1,"We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version. but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better. but at this price point. I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home. and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from. but I stick to the modest. classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight. but I believe Maglite to be the best. and I hope this review helps."
4,"This four hour video looks a the familiar &quot;Joseph&quot; story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First. it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say &quot;brava&quot; to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally. the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However. my &quot;four star&quot; rating refers to the &quot;flashback&quot; section of the film.  Yes. why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the &quot;B&quot; grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden."
8,"My bullies love Nylabones. they are the one thing that they do not destroy! I got them these & the big smooth bone 2 pack for Christmas. Those were a big hit. these they don't seem to like. I do not know if it's the flavor or texture . . . They have the big smooth heavy bone looking Nylabones which they like okay. they have the BIG nubby ones which they love. so I thought they would like these but they looked at them. chewed on them a little & left them for the big smooth flavored ones in the 2 pack. Those they chew on daily along with the big nubby ones. Maybe it's the flavor. They have Nylabones that are 3 years old!"
5,"I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS:  It fits perfectly; it's 'fur' lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five). but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over. two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side. and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.CONS:  It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some 'Made in China' characteristics.I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest.  On a personal level. I'd prefer it didn't say 'Epiphone' on the outside.  But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335."
4,"What makes this little film so special is so varied and precious. that it's hard to identify one area.  Of course Rudolph is the main character. as is his little girlfriend.  Then there's Burl Ives. who narrates it. and the wonderful music of Johnny Marks.  I perform his music every year. it's so upbeat and inspirational.  That he was asked to write the music for this movie was no surprise.The animation is a little dated. but the kids won't mind.  You won't find this kind of movie made anymore.  It has so many nice qualities. not to mention Santa and his elves. and the Isle of Misfit Toys. and the 'Bumble.' and Cornelius of the Yukon.I laugh as I think of all this. and it's a sweet smile. and a great film for Christmas!!!"
9,"Being new to shooting using a scope I have found this one to be simple. rugged and easy to adjust . I have it on a Ruger American in 308 and once I used a little loc-tight  I have no worry about it moving .  My only complaint if you could even call it that was there were no scope rings included with the scope .  But with this set up shooting off a bench I have a .75 to 1 MOA rifle with the right ammo so for the price I can not complain ."
1,"This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a 'a grout brush'; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement). but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium. lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head. the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out. I will reorder another."
4,"I'm another one of those people who used to see daikaiju movies on Saturday matinee TV as a child. Close as I came to a couch potato and it made me really interested in Japan. I've been waiting so long to find these films given a proper digital conversion. The last few years have made me very excited (for an adult) as Toho has finally pulled the cork out of its uptight behind 15+ years into the digital revolution and allowed the west to see the Japanese-language widescreen versions of most of the Godzilla oeuvre without spending $$$ on an import.As usual. on Ghidorah. Classic Media has added some interesting short extras. I feel lucky. at this point. to even get to see the theatrical release. so my bias is very pro. but the price really is a no-brainer. isn't it?"
6,"I've used print at home business cards before. and they always left a rough edge.  There was no way around it- you could tell you printed them at home.  I have to say however. that these 'Clean Edge' business cards are a vast improvement on the past!  To a trained eye. you can still see the edge was that of a tear-away. but they look pretty darn good!  I wouldn't be embarrassed to pass these out. as I was with the older versions."
8,"I had my dog on this for a couple months and noticed a wonderful bloom in his coat but also noticed his ears began to be unusually smelly. I feed my dog raw so he doesn't get grains anywhere. I checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed. Took him off Nupro and his ears cleared up. We now stay away from anything with flax. After adding raw green tripe to his diet. I am noticing similar positives. It is a shame. Nupro is otherwise a great product. I would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax."
4,"First off. not ALL of this movie made sense to me. I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything. Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen 'Life Of Brian' which is the exact opposite of this film. So I might have learned some things already. I do have many questions about it. though. I get why so many people were offended. Because Jesus sinned in some way. Throughout the movie. he kept praying that he. along with a few other folks would be forgiven. but THAT'S where I get confused. Oh well. I'm surprised I did understand SOME things. and yet. it's very interesting."
10,"The Delta 12&quot; drill press is OK for a bench top model.  I was disappointed in the chuck as it tends to stick and requires using the key at all times rather than just for final tightening.  Also I believe I would rather have had the 5/8&quot; chuck that comes on the 16&quot; floor model more than the 1/2&quot; chuck supplied with the 12&quot;.  For the extra hundred and fifty (approx) bucks I should have bought the larger floor model and got better capacity. longer quill stroke. larger and more stable table for mounting fences and jigs. etc.In the 12&quot; presses defense. it was and is the nicest of the benchtop models I have seen."
3,"When I read the book description. I thought this would be an interesting read. as a story about a married couple discovering their 'forbidden' desires and kinks is right up my alley. but when I opened the ebook and realized it was a short story. I had to lower my expectations. Still. I thought it could be good. because skilled authors can make almost anything work.Sadly. that wasn't the case here. The story's premise was never developed into anything resembling a plot. The book description was the whole story. or better. the setup for the sex scene where Roake's and Jenesta's hidden sexual needs were revealed. I've read and enjoyed stories like that (aka smut) before and I'm sure I'll read and enjoy others in the future. so why didn't I like this one? It all comes down to Roake and Jenesta. I'm afraid. I didn't 'connect' with them so I found myself indifferent to their sex scene and HEA."
9,"I bought this trailer for a trip up north. My husband filled the tires at home to the correct psi. Drove it around the driveway and everything worked great. We get to our destination and go to hook it up and the tubes are BLOWN. Actually shredded looking in spots. We were way up north and spent over an hour in the car to find a town big enough that had a store that sold bike supplies. Once both tubes were replaced the trailer worked great. Very easy to put together. I couldn't figure out how to attach it to the bike but that isn't my area. My husband had it attached in less then 2 minutes. The rubber on the original tube was very thin. I'm surprised more haven't blown."
4,"This is a fairly short Christmas special but it was made in the old days when a half hour on TV contained only four minutes of commercials. The best part about The Little Drummer Boy is its wholesome simplicity. The fact that it is so unabashedly religious is its strongest point in my opinion. Chasing the hate out of your heart and replacing it with love is a valuable lesson for all children. so I agree with another reviewer about its being a timeless family classic. It begins rather slowly but the last five minutes are absolutely outstanding and worth scanning back to watch a second time. The quotations from scripture give it its oomph but this also means that it would never be televised today on any of the big three networks. This might be a good DVD to buy because you probably won't catch it for free."
5,"These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company."
6,"Not only did I use these for notebook dividers. I used them to label file folders.  They fit and look great with some minor adjustments (putting one folder inside another).  One of the nicest aspects of using these for dividers is the straight placement.  I think they look much nicer than anything I've used before.  I have several notebooks that have over 25 dividers. so the time I saved creating and applying the labels is very much appreciated. I also took advantage of the fact that I could play around with section titles to see which would fit best.Avery labels are about all I can get either at my local Staples and Wal-Mart stores.  (I don't even know who else makes them anymore.) I'll be buying these again."
11,"Formula D is a great party game that gets the entire room cheering. Even for the starter players. there is a set of basic rules that most can grasp very quickly. Every time I have played this game. I've had a great time. I do not enjoy cars or racing but the excitement of this game really gets your adrenaline going.The game lends easy to advanced players who want to implement the advanced rule set that want to make the game far more complicated and even more exciting.With the amount of people that can play. this game is a great pick for people that want to start introducing people into unconventional board games. I highly recommend this for anyone that is looking for a game to include a large group of people."
5,"Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage. it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small &#34;thumbs up&#34; to Amazon."
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
1,"This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++. would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet. so I am not sure on the quality. I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know . because I did the hard ground-level research. opening the controller. finding the battery. removing the battery. examining the battery. finding the name of the battery. replacing the battery. closing the battery containment area. and so on."
8,"My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew. and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems. with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well. that. and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep. since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!After months of use. I take the worn down toys away and replace them. and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.If you have a dog that loves chewing. I've say to give them a try. at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine. these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot."
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
11,"It threw me when my six year old asked for a body for Christmas. When he explained he wanted to know how the body works. I found this and I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. We do this often and we read the book that comes with it. The only way this could get better is if it came with a case to hold everything. He likes that the body parts are squishy and I like that he's learning while playing. The Organ-izer is one of his favorites. He likes knowing what everything is called. and I like the book that helps with proper placement of the organs. I would buy this one again!"
9,"This is a good quality indoor-outdoor basketball.  The texture is soft and very easy to grip when new. with deep seams allowing excellent ball control.  Regulation size (29.5).  Being soft. it's not Spalding's most durable outdoor ball--the Street model may be more durable if you play outdoors all the time. and the tack on this one does wear off after a couple of dozen hours on cement.  Indoors. it'll last forever and stay nice and grippy. It needed a little air when I received it. but otherwise. I'm totally satisfied with it.  (Although not a big deal. I also happen to like the rich leather-like color more than the brighter orange of some balls.)"
6,"These are amazing! How clever that someone devised a way to bend thin strips of shiny metal in such a fashion that they can be used to clip several sheets of paper products together so they don't get lost. They don't work as well as my stapler. but those with commitment issues will find the paper clip a great alternative. They can also be bent into fun shapes when you are faced with idle time sitting at your desk. However. it seems that once they are altered from their original shape. they do not perform their intended task very well anymore. Sure glad that I purchased 1.000 of these little buggers."
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"I bought one to try it; I will be buying more. All I had to do was adjust the screws for a tight fit.  Some have criticized the noise level; remember that blades designed for exceptionally smooth cuts will contribute to the noise level because of their inherent design characteristics.  If this is a problem for you. cut the initial slot using a blade with a strong alternating angle on the teeth and a wide kerf.When installing. you might have to increase the relief on the bottom; my blade was all the way down and made contact after only 1/4 turn but I didn't have to increase the relief.Personally. I'm going to buy at least 2 more; one for 45 degree angles and one for my dado blade.  Exceptional quality and price."
1,"got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But. the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4.5.8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts."
4,"Richard Boone is both narrator and participant in some of these episodes.  The historical background given by Boone in the opening scenes is brief and to the point so that you can be taken to the scene of the action quickly and efficiently.This series is a fine snapshot of medical practices of the 1950s which might seem outmoded now.  Electro-convulsive therapy is shown as a treatment practice in the '50s.  The effects of a nuclear bomb explosion are graphic and chilling to watch and listen to.  The open heart valve replacement is quite intriguing even in black and white.  Overall this is a series that while it might seem to be somewhat dated is good for historical background and comparison with the way medicine is practiced now.Growing up in the 1950s this was the state of medicine as I knew it and it seemed pretty impressive.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in medical history."
4,"Did I miss something that the other reviewers saw? Or did I get a defective DVD set? This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The &quot;Cliffhanger episodes&quot; are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father. Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls."
9,"Coleman stoves have always been easy to dent. scratch. get burned on and are not for the weak of spirit.  On the other hand. properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost.  The white gas can be stored for years before using.  Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots.  I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones.  It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out!  I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous. tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect.  By their nature camp stoves get stored a lot and used some.  These are the good ones."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
11,"ABBY CADABBYThe Easter Bunny brought Abby to our two year old granddaughter this year.  Abby is one of Paige's favorites on Sesame Street.  When Paige saw little Abby sitting in her Easter basket she screamed ABBY! and hasn't let go of her since.Abby is made very well. very sturdy and durable. She is a GUND. so you know she is of high quality.  Her outfit is bright and shiny. her little mouth has a heart in the center of it.  She is cuter than you can imagine and a doll that any little girl would love to own.  She comes complete with her wand; how could she function without it?Abby has a good and happy home now.  Get one for your special little girl.  We did!Thank you!Pam"

A knock at the door interrupts them. and Wade is suddenly on the scene.  For the first time in his life. Ryan has to face unfamiliar feelings. and the fact that he doesn't want to share Angie.This is a very erotic sexy story.  The chemistry between Angie and Ryan is to die for."
8,"I haven't used the product long enough to evaluate whether or not it will help my dog's hip dysplasia. however I can tell you that it has caused HORRIFIC gas. Bad enough that I had to put my dog out of my room in the night (wher he usually sleeps) because it was almost gagging me and was hard to breathe. He has not had a diet change. the only thing changed is I added this supplement to his regular food. so it's obviously the supplement causing the gas. Not sure how long I can handle the gas. but I will give it some more time to see if it helps his hips. as he really needs that."
1,"I suffer with very very dry eyes. They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them. Recently the drops just weren't doing it for me anymore.... felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan. I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes. I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging. For my 'Dry eye syndrome' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped. My eyes are no longer red. They do not burn. they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it."
9,"I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years.  I have lots of knives. as I'm a collector but this is my go-to blade for just about anything from fishing to cutting up boxes.  For the price. it's hard to get a better knife.  I still use my old one after 15 years. even though my wife bought me this new one last Christmas.  There's no reason to ever second guess whether or not you should buy this knife.  It's a no brainer.  The newer one changed ever so slightly. but for all practical purposes it's the same one I've been using all these years.  Just get it.......trust me!"
4,"Ghidorah (also known as 'Ghidrah' in the U.S. edit of the film) is a merciless three-headed dragon from outer space with the abilities to shoot lethal electric bolts from its mouths. and it will have to take the combined might of Rodan. Mothra. and Godzilla to defeat it! A very enjoyable movie. It starts out a bit slow. but once the film starts to get going. it has possibly some of the best and most exciting action scenes out of any Godzilla movie. With a really good story. four monsters. one of them Ghidorah - my favorite Godzilla villain. it's hard not to like this one. This film also features Godzilla's transition from bad guy to good guy and the last one in a long while to be taken mostly seriously. A great movie that would be a shame to miss out on.Highly Recommended!"
4,"I have many copies of this movie. I pass it on a lot..I use it in teaching religion classes all the time..Jesus is not a solomman who walks around in majesty...He is a person who loves the people he heals.he laughs.he is charismatic.he cries...he isGod....He is the Jesus I always in visioned.....If you aren't afraid to take Jesus off his holier then thou shelf and placehim in the human world of laughter.love.and pain...and still be the Son of God. I suggest this movie."
9,"The soap smells nice. lathers up easily and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. I am a firefighter and after being exposed to smoke from burning plastics etc the smell stays with you for a day or two. I use this soap and it seems to get rid of that nasty smokey feeling after the first shower. I have it in my locker at work and in my shower at home. I will probably never buy any other soap at this point. I like the tip from others about using a foaming dispenser...will try that for sure.I dinged it one star due to the preachy label. I peeled the label off as soon as I got it since it only has a few lines about the actual product and ingredients. all the rest is like scripture. If religion is your thing. good for you. but I don't need it in my face and I don't need a religious message on the stuff that I am paying for."
4,"'...'The Passion of the Christ' has caused plenty of controversy. just like the ministry of Christ did and still continues to do to this day. When a faith-oriented film has such an emotional impact on so many lives and creates so much discussion between millions of people with different religious backgrounds. you know a must-see feature has been made.' -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder'It's the same story the Bible's been telling us for years. but Mel Gibson did a truly awesome job of bringing it to people in such a real way.' -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films. check out cruciflicks.net where 'We don't judge people. just the movies they make.'"
4,"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney. this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift. but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl. and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age. you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.That is what indicates real staying power. not how many toys one can invent. market and make profit from."
6,"These come in one of those standard cheap plastic containers which is always a bummer because you end up needing to put them in something else eventually.  However. the price was great for a 30 count of various sizes.  The only size lacking is the very large ones which I do have occasion to use when I'm unable to use anything but.  That or sit with a whole puncher forever and put them into a binder.  The shipping was quick and they were in pristine condition when they arrived.  I haven't as of yet had a problem with them not being durable which is big bonus so great material."
10,"I bought this belt sander to help strip the barn board floors in our 1870 farm house.  The unit worked very well to strip 85% the lacquer that would other wise instantly plug up may dewalt pad sander.  I have used roughly 20 of the 40 grit belts so far and only had to adjust the tracking only three times during heavy use.  As far as the bag unit provided I have not tried it as my wife had bought a small shop vac years ago that had the right size hose to attach to the exhaust port for instant dust removal. I did have the dust collection unit plug up once but I did use a large shop vac to blow air backwards through the sander and it cleaned out the plug instantly.  Overall I'm very pleased I bought this sander."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
5,"This is a tough unit. easy to set and locks tight.  The materials are robust.In a home studio there is never a lot of room and I didn't want a big boom hanging off the other side of my mic stand.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the package there is an illustration of this being used at the end of a long boom to hang a mic in the perfect possition. and yeah. one could totally do that with this.This is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture."
10,"Have hung my share of drywall over the years (not as a pro) and always used either hammer and drywall nails or a cordless drill with a bit to drive screws.  This drywall screwdriver really speeds up the process--even for a small room.  It does take a while to get the hang of it. however. because unless you drive the in screw perfectly straight. it won't seat properly and you'll have to back it out and try again.  I'd practice driving a few screws on a scrap of drywall first to get the knack of using it and to adjust the depth setting for your job before beginning work--the screw should be just below the surface of the paper so you don't hit it with a taping knife--if the knife &#34;clicks&#34; on the screw when you go over it. you need to set the depth a little lower."
8,"At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically.  It definitely doesn't get chewed down.  The material is very. very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth..  However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls.  Me I don't like it. but the dog does and since she doesn't chew on it obsessively. unlike other things I'm not too worried about her teeth."
5,"i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break strings.hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands."
9,"The lock combination can be set by the user.  I bought 6 of them. and set the combination the same on all of them to make it easy for me to remember (I only have to remember one combination. and I do not have to worry about loosing any keys).  This is an excellent feature.I also like that it fits on my shotguns. pistols. and rifles.  You can not see it in the picture. but when you separate the two sides of the lock. there are pressure pins that catch the trigger mechanism to ensure a tight and secure closure on the trigger.  Very good design at a great price."
3,"On the Edge will keep you on the edge of your seat as you read this hot story by Kallysten. On the Edge is a short story about a couple. where Brett is the owner of the On the Edge Club and has an apartment above the club with his silent partner Lisa.  Although the club is new in town. it is an instant success as humans and vampires gather to party together.Lisa. a vampire goes down to the club to party and feed. Leo. a vampire from her past appears and she brings him home to play with Brett and her.  Brett is surprised that he likes what the three of them do together. The next morning Leo isn't sure how Brett will feel but the surprise ending made this a perfect short story.  On the  Edge may be short but it is packed with emotion and lots of hot vampire sex.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review.  The views expressed in the review are my own."
1,"I have been using Ayr Nasal Gel for the past two years at bed time and have found that it keeps my nasal passages open throughout the night and it has eliminated the stuffiness I had before discovering this product.  I buy it in quantity from Amazon and save substantially from retail pharmacy's.  I can't recommend it more highly. especially after this winter.  Since it has been unseasonably cold making keeping adequate humidity in the home next to impossible with humidifiers and even warm mist vaporizors. Ayr Nasal Gel has provided relief that otherwise would of made my sleeping through the night extremely difficult. A small amount at the bottom of each nostril is all one needs to use and a tube will last for a reasonable time making it a cost effective means verses nasal strips."
11,"If you're new to Munchkin. I recommend checking out the original Munchkin and its reviews first for game play. mechanics. and feedback.  Especially my review.  It's a good one.  (Shameless self-promoting - I have no pride.)Munchkin 2 is an expansion of the original Munchkin.  It's not a complete game in itself.  It provides no new variants to game play. no extra aspects to consider. no new rules.  It's just more cards.  More items. more monsters. more humor. more cool stuff.BUT... more cards means less card repetition which makes the game more fun and definitely increases the replay value.  And the new bits of humor on the cards is worth the extra cost alone.  Size (of your deck) matters.Munchkin is awesome.  Buy this.  Buy it now."
4,"I first rented this when I was about 15 &amp; my mum went apes**t. A movie about a guy who kills people with a blowtorch. COOOOOL! However the blowtorch isn't that big a player in the movie. This is your typical Vietnam vet revenge story ad nauseum. Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds &quot;life&quot; to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes. including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed. and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder? I'd advise you not to eat a hamburger while watching this movie. Worst of all though is the godawful country-western song which plays during the opening credits. Yeech!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
9,"This was a great surprise for the money.  I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out. At this price why not?  I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.  The door anchor worked great.  I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.  This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I highly recommend."
1,"This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good. subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy. those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS."
3,"This is a short story that give you an insight to the series of On The Edge .. Brett owner to a club that not only caters to Vampire but humans as well.. and his girlfriend of 11 months... And how Leo well you gotta read...There is a M/M. M/F. M/F/M scenes not graphic...I found the book to be interesting and different... Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series...I received to book for an honest review and with being a spoiler I found the book to be 4 stars. thanks"
3,"A little ho hum.  Joanna is a great heroine who really needs a break.  Aiden is her break.  He is a super nice guy but the I can never love again because I buried my heart with my first wife has been done to death.  He comes from a dream family with the exception of one brother who i assume will crop up in another book.  They're all kindness and light.  The good people from the church however are all mean and backstabbing.  Could someone explain to me why in all these Christian books the church goers are gossipy hags who have fun hurting peoples feelings.  Anyway it is nicely written and has some real charm going for it.  But don't expect originality."
8,"I have a senior maltese who is prone to knee problems.  He began experiencing pain in his legs when jumping on and off the couch so I decided to get these for him to help with his joints.  I give him one each day and I have not seen him limp or yelp in pain ever since I started giving these to him. which has been over a year.  The best part is. he loves the taste of them. and when I open up the baggie. he gets super excited and starts wagging his tail and licking his lips!  I knocked off one star b/c I have noticed that some bags are not as fresh as others (no I haven't tasted the product myself but the fresher products are softer and the older ones are harder)."
8,"This product is great for about 1-2 years. Over time. the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food. which causes the motor to break down. even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor. so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain. but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food. fur. and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir."
10,"If you've got a lot of wood that's the same width to rip. this featherboard is a great help!  It locks onto an iron table like a suction cup. and is hard to move without using the built-in cam.  The built-in cam makes it easy to move when you're ready to reposition it.Here are the only things I don't like about the product:1)  If you're not doing a lot of repetitive cuts. it's sometimes more trouble than it's worth to set it up.2)  If there's ANY dust on your table. the effectiveness is immediately reduced.3)  The plastic holddown makes a loud SLAP sound when you push the wood past it.  You get used to it. but it does cause one's attention to be diverted sometimes. and that's not great.Having said all those negative things. however. I'd rate the tool 4 stars out of 5. and I use mine on my table saw at least 2 times a week."
3,"Kasey and Garrett are twins who happen to be both gay and public figures. Garrett is an out gay actor and Kasey a basketball player who isn't ashamed of his sexuality but is hesitant about comming of for safety reasons.Gram is an openly gay club owner in the city the twins live in. Garrett frequents the club more often than Kasey does but Gram has a crush on Kasey.This is Kasey and Gram's story and it is a good one about find love and working to hold on to it even when it doesn't fit your 'ten year plan' to have it now.Kasey and Gram find ways to be together without to many problems and Gram is an amazing partner who respects Kasey's need to not be out to the world.A very good short story that delivers on many levels with some pretty hot sex scens"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
10,"I have used this sander in many ways it was not intended. Abuse after abuse it keeps running. I would have given it four stars because the dust bag is somewhat cheap and does not attach properly but then I dropped it 2 stories on to a paved driveway. Not even a dent. Up to five stars. I have used it non stop for hours. I should have bought more sander for the tasks but it was there and I needed a sander. When I do finally get a random orbital sander I will get another DeWalt."
4,"I really wanted to buy a kickboxing video that would not be too complicated. As a user of other Kathy Smith videos. I decided to purchased this one. The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout. Unlike a lot of Kathy's other videos. there are no modifications for lower or higher intensity. but since it is not a standard floor aerobics video. it really isn't necessary to do so. If you are looking for something different to add to your routine. this is a good choice."
6,"I've used Avery labels since my days as a mail clerk. way back in the Carter administration.  They have always offered a top-quality product. and the Easy Peel line for laser printers are no exception.These labels are just so wonderful; by using word processing software such as Microsoft Word. one can easily select the 'labels and envelops' option under 'Tools' and up pops the correct format for the labels.  Just start typing or import addresses and you are ready to go.  I'll admit that the most use I've had on these labels are for Christmas cards and hand writing labels. but these would be great for a small business.Recommended product; another winner from Avery.  They work well. perform well. and don't screw up the laser printer.  As good as it gets."
6,"These 1' x 2 5/8' labels have many uses. I've been using them for quite a while. and they've always performed perfectly. They stick well and they don't smudge.Also. although Avery says that each sheet should only go through a printer once. who works like that? I've done sheets printing one label at a time. with no problems at all. If you do that. I'd recommend starting with the bottom row of labels and working your way up. Of course. your laser printers might be different from mine. so your mileage might vary.The labels now have a 'Pop-up Edge' for easy peeling. but I haven't used it. since I usually print one label at a time. The pop-up edge facilitates peeling of an entire column of labels at once. However. I've never had the slightest bit of trouble peeling labels off individually.They are excellent labels. and Avery offers software and/or templates to make it easy to print on them."
8,"I received the bears (bought 2 of them) yesterday and I gave my 9 month old puppy Macie(Pug & JRT Mix) one of the bears. She had the pocket pulled out thru the head where the squeeky is within 30 min or so. She continued to play with the bear but also the pocket and the squeeky is just about destroyed....lol...she has a tendency to destroy every squeeky in a toy. so this doesnt surprise me. A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet. I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped 'Macie approved'"
8,"I just received this product and I ordered it for my dog&#8217;s food. I bought a 30 pound bag that I&#8217;ve been using and then filled in this container but it over flowed! (My dog eats Natures Recipe for adults) So right of the back a little FYI. Also the door for closing has a little snapped and it has a place on top to put a lock. Since mine was full the door is snapping back open.I ordered this product because it looked convenient to take the food out and I liked the container size. The size is the only reason why I&#8217;m thinking about keeping it but I&#8217;m not 100% sure right now."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
5,"Super low capacitance- on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from Mogami. Canare. etc. The connectors are fantastic and they come with Planet Waves' super-handy elastic cord wrap. These are outstanding guitar cables at a VERY good price. I used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors. but with these. I don't see the point. The lifetime exchange warranty also makes the DIY repair thing kind of pointless too (of course Amazon's return policy is still 30 days. so be aware of that- you'd need to mail it back to the MFR or take it to another dealer to exchange - that is if you ever had to)."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
1,"I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard. and sometimes I shave in the shower. so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time. but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also. if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week). I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product."
11,"I tried playing and my eyes glazed over and I was so so lost; meanwhile 6 kids sit down figured it out and can't quit playing.'Oh. take a halfling from Matt'' I have borrowed swords.''Does anyone have a plutonium dragon?''Do you have a wandering monster?''I have an illusion card.''I have a nasty drooler.''Can you kill it?''You'll trade me 2 treasures for that?''Is anyone a warrior?''I'm a warrior; I would give you... no. I'm not going to trade my warrior.''Let's take a level away from Matt.''I could make you an elf. Madi.''I'll just try to run away. I mean what's the worst that can happen. I'm dead. So. I can just escape from it.''So. you lose your helmet.''Hey can I be a girl instead of a boy?''Are you a cleric?'If you are looking for a great gift for a 13- 16 year old (which is probably the hardest age bracket in the world to buy for) you should consider this."
8,"I have a 7 year old Maltese. and a nine month old miniature schnauzer. The size of these treats was fine for them. and after some initial reluctance at the unusual flavors (pizza and cheese. with chicken and beef being the normal flavors) the dogs seemed to like them. However. the day after I began feeding them Scooby Snacks the Maltese began throwing up. and the Schnauzer had alarming. unnaturally colored diarrhea. It did not immediately occur to me that it might be the treats. but the next day when the symptoms continued I stopped feeding them treats altogether and all upset ceased. Nobody else seems to have had this problem. perhaps I simply got a bad batch. but I am not willing to try these again."
10,"I'm crazy about these blades. blades that perform exactly as promised. I made some cuts with my Bosch jigsaw using regular blades. Then I switched blades and made cuts in the same materials with the Progessor blades. I was awed. The cuts were easy. fast. and smooth. I even made some cuts in the wooden garden ties picked up from Home Depot. I usually cut these with my chain saw. The ties were no obstacle for my Bosch jigsaw armed with Progressor blades.I've used these blades on plywood. planks. garden ties. and 2' PVC pipe with equal success."
5,"These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine. I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use. I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers. or put undue stress on your guitar. Not only that. but they sound great. Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass. I love how they color code their strings on the 'ball ends'. To me this makes it much easier when changing strings. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands. Give these a try. I think you'll be satisfied."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
5,"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano. which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion. a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."
3,"This was a mildly interesting. slightly humorous. day-to-day chronicle of a very boring guy's life. I found the historical insights engaging. and some of the daily activities of people in those days interesting. I wish that there had been a little more about the wider events that were happening beyond just the writer's activities. But. then. that would not have been in concert with the title of the book. The author certainly believed in truth in advertising. The title of the book says it all. It's a quick read and never complex."
10,"This is a life saver. and delivers as promissed. but is way over priced for what it is.I cut a lot of yellow pine. which wants to pinch behind the blade.  I've had to shut the saw off too many times in the middle of a cut and pray for no kickback.  That is why I knew it was time to invest in one of these before something went wrong.  After ~30min setup on a Grizley 1023SL. I can't believe that I didn't buy one sooner.  It is so easy to add and remove the splitter. that you keep it on the saw!!!  The only drawback is the price.  Considering it cost half of what the saw cost me. it was hard to pony up that much cash.  But I must say. that it is still cheaper than one trip to the ER."
11,"This is the updated Fantasy Flights version of HTMF. This game portrays you as a hungry penguin on the hunt for tasty fish. In doing so you must round up your fish before any rival penguins claim it for their own. Your game board per se consist of 40 hexagonal tiles and always changes. Some might complain that this takes awhile to set up. but if you have some help with your other player(s) set up is a breeze. Fantastic game. great price and best of all the WIFE loves it!"
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
6,"It has an eye-angled. upright display. and is perfect to work on a desk. The keypad is not as soft as other calculators on the market. giving you a retro and reliable feel (if you have ever used those full size desktop calculators popular a decade ago. you know what I am talking about.)I find other calculators (e.g.. Sharp EL-377T) awkward to use on a desk. They are perfect for handheld. If you want to have a calculator on your desk and operate with one hand and without leaning forward to check the LCD screen. this Canon LS-82Z is perfect for you."
5,"This is my second order of the 10 pack. A local store wants 29.99 for one set of these. The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands I've tried; including. and especially the most commonly used eb's. I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings. On occasion. it looks as if the winding is chipping off. but not at the frets. I change strings quite often so it really doesn't matter. Not sure what that's about but it doesn't affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars. Any less and I'd look dumb."
5,"I bought this pedal at a local shop and use it with both guitar and Bass. I usually put it before a distortion pedal and my original Phase 90. or use it as a standalone with an old amplifier to even out the signal. I do notice it is more effective with the guitar than bass. but that is typical. I usually do not turn the compression knob past 12 o'clock. but when using a chain of pedals. the compressor helps even out the lows and highs. The pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also. For the price. it seems like the best economical choice for compressor pedal out there and the MXR pedals are built like tanks. I have had this one and the Bass model for years and they hold up great while showing their age well."
10,"I've had my Delta planer for quite awhile now. In its lifetime it has had hundreds of board feet of hard and soft wood passed thru its portels. Much of this wood has been some of the hardest stuff on the planet. Mesquite. Quebracho. Vera. Mistol and white Oak just to name a few. I am on the first edge of my second set of knives. As in all planers. knife adjustment is critical. and with these knives it is as simple as tying your shoelace. Knives are sharp enough to shave with out of the pkg. and the locater holes make alignment a snap. Getting four cutting edges for this price makes the whole package a five star unit. I've had my problems with some Delta products. but this isn't one of them.Love the planer and love these knives. Highly recommend."
5,"This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar. the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul."
8,"I have used Frontline Plus on all my dogs for years. It works great on my toy poodle and bichon; who are indoor 22/7.Now for my other dog a pitbull mix.. he gets ticks 3 weeks after I put in the application. I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin. but these ticks don't die! they feed on his blood :.( it gets bad. He stays outside 16 hours a day. I dont know why front line doesn't work with him. It works great with my other dogs."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
5,"On my mixer. I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip. return on the ring. and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4' TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return."
6,"Before the age of checkbook register smartphone apps. I dutifully turned to this calculator to balance my checkbook. I'd tried other calculators. but they were either too small. the keys were too close together. the display too small. or something else made them less than ideal. With this one. it stays in place on my desk. it has a large display. the buttons are laid out intuitively. it goes well with my modern decor. and it has both battery and solar power. This calculator would be good for home of business use. but would not be suitable for a student since it does not come with a case and probably would not stand up to being thrown around in a backpack. locker. or desk."
1,"this wax is awesome. its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out. and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube. ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75% gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens. Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them."
11,"This is a very fun and educational game.  Players use cute trains to build 'tracks' across the US to different cities completing a card that details what cities need to be linked to get points.  Its very easy to learn.  The only thing is that it can be complicated to score the game-we tend to do it at the end of the game rather than trying to do it during play.  This is one of the few games that is fun with just two players.  Very Entertaining! (ticket to ride Europe is also fun)."
6,"The first time I purchased Scotch Gift Wrap Tape was three years ago at Christmastime.  I saw it in the drugstore. thought it looked interesting. and decided to treat myself to something new/different.  I immediately became a big fan of it: it blended perfectly with my wrapping paper. virtually disappearing.  I was impressed with how nice it looked.  And. like regular Scotch tape. it was very strong and very easy to work with.Nowadays. this is the only Scotch tape I buy.  It's perfect for everything: home. office. crafts. and of course gift wrapping.  The price is the same as the other types of Scotch type.  It works just as well. if not better.  And it's made in the U.S.A.  What more could you ask for?This is one of those simple. elegant. no-frills products that gets the job done. and done right. every time.  Give it a try. you'll love it."
4,"Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic. rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas. I meant Happy Holidays!"
4,"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur 'The Fonz' Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts. he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it. as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."
9,"This is the little brother of the DMT diafold.  Very light and small.  I keep one on my keychain.  The extended length when open. is an aid to keeping a constant angle.  I have never had one come apart but I suspect they are not as durable as the diafold and are not available two sided (two different grits) which of course. would be heavier.  Mine seem to be rust resistant for use with water to wash away metal dust which would otherwise accumulate on the surface.  These Mini Sharps are not for any work heavier than edge maintenance.UPDATE 9/7/2012:-- The molded-on flanges of the plastic handle broke off when I tried to unfold my Mini-Sharp. No more than normal force was applied.  It is now in two pieces.  I want an item like this to be dependable. Lowering my rating to one star."
4,"This is the best film I'm ever seen. It is more than a movie. seeing 'The Passion of the Christ' is literally a spiritual experience that will not leave you the same. You will be changed one way or the other after seeing what Jesus suffered. The realism of this portrayal captures the historical context of the days Jesus was on earth. Use of the original language adds to the authenticity. Similarly the ethnicity of the actors adds another layer to foundation of capturing history on film.This is an instant classic indeed. Any objective viewer who sees it cannot deny this fact. It is 'other.' i.e.. it is in a category of its own. Yes it might be listed as a 'religious film.' but it is so much more. The artists. producer. writers. creators who put this work together had the help of a Power beyond their abilities."
9,"I got this for my father-in-law for Christmas. The knife is a smidge bigger than what I would have liked. however. it does have all the basic tools I would want in a Swiss Army Knife. After reviewing multiple knives I don't think there is another that has this convenient a set of tools. There are others with more bells and whistles. but I wouldn't want to have anything bigger for daily carry. If you are willing to sacrifice some tools there are smaller knives. but then you find yourself missing things when you need them. This knife is a good balance in the middle. Quality is what you would expect from a Swiss Army Knife."
4,"this is from the series of books that spawned the wizard of oz film.in this one.the lion must find the ultimate icon of good or something to that effect.i belive its a flower.dorothy is along for the ride too.the witch has a evil icon that spreads evil to everything it touches.only the flower can stop the witch.the kids like it some.its a fantasy/adventure type deal.the wizard of oz movie was far better than this cartoon.ive never read the book but i think it would be quite excellent.id love to see the other books turned into films also."
5,"I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it. but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick. sweep pick. tremelo pick. tap with the pick better. Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me. Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^.^"
3,"I finally read this book last month and enjoyed every chapter. It shows how they managed to survive on the island by making tools and items in their cave. This book is by far one of the best 'stranded on an island' books you could hope for. It is probably one of Jules Verne's best. The inhabitants of an island are banded together and when they get into a tight spot. there is a mysterious force that always helps out. This force is not revealed until nearly the end. I highly recommend it to everyone."
3,"I really can't say I loved it. It was good in parts and than slow and boring in others.  My biggest problem with the book I think has to do with the heroine. Yes. he abandoned her and so on but after he explains his reasons which were understandable you would think that the wife at some point would understand too. but nope.It takes 245 pages for this 2 to actually get together. After they finally get to lie together something else comes up and we have to read another 100 more pages for this women to forgive him again. The story and the idea is not bad the last 40 pages were quit good and romantic but before I reached those I actually struggled to continue reading."
11,"This game is very easy to learn (I don't understand any of the negative reviews saying it's &#34;too complex&#34;) and lots of fun. as long as you're not the big loser in any particular game. Imagine getting hemmed in and locked down in Settlers of Catan. multiplied by 100. That's how frustrating this game is if you happen to choose the wrong path cards which (unbeknownst to you at the time) conflict with someone else's ambitions. Satisfaction with the game is very hit and miss. as it can be VERY tedious when you have no chance of accomplishing your objections. Part of the appeal of the game is also one of its biggest drawbacks: you can easily see how well you're doing compared to everyone else. which means that you can also tell very easily when you have no chance at all of winning."
1,"I have been using another. more viscous. product for quite some time for dry eye. I tried this and liked it as something to use in between. because it is thin enough. it does not blur my vision. However. it is too thin for much protection now that the heat is on in the house. so I use both. alternating them. I have a bone to pick with the makers. though. They designed the little containers (this is preservative free single containers) with a funny grip that often blocks the liquid from coming out. which is very frustrating and not good for use while driving."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
8,"Previously I had fed our Lhasa other brands of food rolls in different flavors but after trying Redbarn Food Rolls. our four-legged companion voted her favorite flavor as Redbarn Beef.  I alternate morning and evening food between the food roll and kibbles. The 4-pound food rolls are so easy to store in the fridge and for long-term in the freezer.  I slice a whole roll into 1-inch slices and then halve them before dividing into two containers - one container for every day and one container in the freezer for future use.  I stick with the Zukes Mini Treats (all flavors) for bribes and training treats.  The food roll is boxed with bubble packing and arrived within a day or two after I placed my order."
3,"The first concern with the paranormal romance genre is whether it is believable enough.  Could I suspend my disbelief?  Yep.  Worked for me.  I liked haveing the bundle because I plowed through these pretty fast.  Each book centers around a man who for genetic and psychological reasons is outcast but loyal.  So... this could take place in Medieval times. a police force. or on a ranch.  The conflicts and the subtle character traits are the best part.  I also like that the danger and mystery element held up.  Sometimes its just a way to get the characters in bed.  Oh. there's that too. but the human element and the well-painted scenery makes these wolves &#34;real.&#34;"
11,"A D&D; themed euro game. What more could you want? :)Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement euro game through and through. You will be placing your 'agents' out in waterdeep to recruit clerics. fighters. wizards and rogues to help you complete quests. Each Lord of Waterdeep has a specific objective for you to complete. like focusing on certain types of quests. You get points by completing quests and bonus points if those quests are of the type requested by your Lord.This game has similar mechanics to Stone Age. Caylus and other worker placement games. but if you like Euro games and D&D;. this is a great one to pick up. It plays in as little as an hour and even though the box says 12+ my 9 yr old plays it with ease."
5,"I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals.I don't use this on my pedal board and don't know if I would recommend it for heavy live use. I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here.It does work well and will power many pedals at one time. I do not use it for powering only one pedal though. This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals.I also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet.Easy to use - it is what it is."
3,"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book. I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that. however. was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book. things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys. other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States. and. the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who. in this instance. are prepared to be generous."
9,"These bands are some of the most well constructed I have seen.  They also have clips on the ends which allows them to be used in tandem. so the red. black. green. blue. and yellow can all be used together for extra resistance. which is a major plus for athletes who need more resistance.  The door anchor included is a very simple design. but it works well.  All of the bands also have a lifetime warranty. just call them and they will ship you a new one (you have to pay shipping though).  The handles are well constructed. and the wrap around handle is pretty standard universal gym type stuff.  Will buy from this company again."
9,"I really like these bands for travel workouts. They take virtually no space in your bag and provide enough resistance for a respectable workout. It's hard to quantify how much weight each one represents. For a thorough workout for each muscle group. it pays to get the extra heavy. heavy and medium bands. Honestly. it's good for some muscle groups. like the triceps. biceps. shoulders and even the back. I haven't used the door attachment. but for the chest. good old-fashioned pushups will do the trick on the road. won't they? As you adjust your foot position on the rubber. you increase or decrease the resistance. Certainly worth the money. as many hotels have sub-standard guyms and 15 minutes with these bands can work you out just fine."
11,"Bananagrams the game is ok. not great.  I guess some people like it. but it's not my cup of tea.  What this is to me is a great set of tiles in a portable bag.  I use the tiles to play another game. Snatch-It.  Snatch-It is a much better game than Bananagrams. but it comes with terrible tiles.  They're harder to read. and there's not nearly enough vowels.  Buy Bananagrams. buy Snatch-It. use the Bananagrams tiles with the rules from Snatch-It."
5,"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz. eq. or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say."
6,"This is a basic stand for a monitor.  It's just a curved metal tube with a metal plate affixed to the top.  The first one I got was defectively assembled -- the metal plate on top was crooked. badly out of square.  I returned it. and the replacement is much better.The color is a sort of metallic black.  There is a gray Allsop logo painted on in raised letters on the front right part of the tube.It gets the job done and looks decent enough."
5,"Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas. but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks. depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood. really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest. but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward."
9,"I'll start by saying this knife may be small. but it is sturdy. It is perfect to carry on you keyring as it's small size won't make your keys excessively bulky and yet it has everything you'd need for day to day uses. It has a knife that is great for cutting small items (string and packaging etc) and although i've had mine for years it is still as sharp as the day I bought it. The scissors may be a touch fiddly but they are sharp and function well. The file and screwdriver have also come in handy at various times. These knives are always well made and their reputation is well deserved. they manage to be aesthetically pleasing. easy to use and sturdy all at the same time. no mean feat. A good entry level swiss army knife and perfect for small jobs whilst out and about.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,"If you like Christmas movies besides 'The Nightmare before Christmas'. you should add this one to your collection. If you don't like Christmas movies then buy 'The Grinch' or 'The Christmas Carol' and see what you act like Grinch/Scrooge. In my humble opinion this is the best telling of Rudolph's story in a musical. Many added side stories with Hermey the dentist. Yukon Cornelius. Abominible Snowman. and the Island of Misfit Toys adds to make a great story. The animated figures are excellent and smooth motioned. Excellent narration by Burl Ives. The music is first rate and will have the family singing along."
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
9,"I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me.  Right out of the packaging. this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable. but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also. the product description says that it is designed for 'spin bikes' and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes. so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike.  However. it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it. even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible.  This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs. which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times. but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand."
8,"We have an 85-pound dog and use 1.000 bags per year (3 per day). There is no denying how good these are. as described by other reviewers. It's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task.What bothers me though is the extra plastic and expense involved with these. Taking into account environmental and economic factors. I prefer to use the smaller and thinner120 Earth Rated Dog Waste Bags. Lavender Scented. 8 Rolls. 120-Count.So what we do is keep both items on hand in a fanny pack. For the biggest or messiest 'jobs'. we use Mutt Mitts. For typical 'duty'. the above linked product is very good. That way everyone wins!"
11,"I LOVE the illustrations on these flashcards. That is what prompted me to buy them for my daughter's second birthday. The cards are very sturdy and have a nice weight and finish to them. My one issue is trying to keep them together. The ring that holds the card together is kind of flimsy. There is value in having the cards be detachable but I almost wish the ring was more permanent. It can be frustrating when you are missing cards. Overall. these are the most attractive. charming ABC flashcards I have ever found. I think I may have been a little too eager though because my daughter is only 2 and she doesn't seem that interested yet. But if you want some nice sturdy flashcards with charming. frameworthy illustrations I would buy these."
10,"I bought this tapering jig prior to tapering my first table leg. It was inexpensive. I was inexperienced. 'nuff said.  The surprise came with its performance.  Although I am confident that I could bend this thing in half  if I was in the right mind. it does a really good job of guiding my  workpiece through the saw.  The adjustment feature is simple and easy to  use. but the &quot;graduated scale&quot; is a bit hard to use accurately.  To set it up. I simply adjust it by eye and then measure from the blade to  the trailing edge of the guide.  This trial and error usually takes no more  than a minute or two. and the jig stays locked on my final setting for as  many cuts as I need to make.  Although there are nicer. more expensive  versions out there. you cannot beat the value for the money with this tool."
10,"All the reviews of this and similar Fein blades are true; they cost a lot and they are fragile and easy to break. I am now faced with the prospect of replacing some of my broken and dull blades and I am willing to pay the price because I must. I have invested over a thousand dollars in blades and sandpaper for the Multimaster and the capabilities that having this kit gives me are too numerous to mention. My advice is to use this particular blade as a last resort. those few instances when no other method can perform the task without risk of peripheral damage to the valuable stuff that we tradesmen and tradeswomen have to cut into. Fein blades are like auto insurance; they are an expensive burden when you don't need them but when you do. you will be very glad that you have them."
5,"These are great strings. They are the right length and go on easy enough. They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on. sound bright. and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever. you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less. that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book. Worth the extra pesos."
10,"This finish sander just isn't up to Makita's standards.  It works well when new. but lacks durability.  Even in a non-professional setting. it just doesn't last.  The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place.  The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order.  It does sand well. I just wish it was more solidly built.  If you need a solid finish sander. you're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models."
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
4,"This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass. not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind. it is quite inventive.Where did he get his red suit?Why does he go down the Chimney?What about his reindeer and his 'Ho Ho Ho'?These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. but it is done well enough."
11,"With this kit you or your child(ren) can write up to 12 pages of text. each with its own illustration. send it off to the company. and receive a professionally printed hardbound book in a few weeks.  There are even options to get gift books. each with its own unique dedication page!  An 'About the Author' section really personalizes the experience.Everything you need is in the kit -- instructions. paper (including practice sheets) and pens.  There's even a postage-paid envelope. so when you're finished writing you can just drop it into a mailbox.  We could not be happier with this product.  It was fun and easy. brought out the kids' imagination. and the product we received was beautifully finished.Highest recommendation."
9,"I bought this to mount on my muzzle loader. It has the ideal magnification for deer hunting in heavy cover where things tend to get up-close and personal.  At the price I paid I didn't expect to get much more than the minimum.  This scope is much better than the minimum.  Light transmission and clarity are way above average.  The size is just right and the build quality is terrific.  My boom stick kicks like a mule but the scope hold it's zero tenaciously. I wish I needed two."
9,"I bought a few of these for my family.  I think I still prefer the rally over this model since it gets rid of the scissors and adds a screwdriver instead.  Still. there is a reason why this is a &#34;classic&#34;!  You won't be disappointed with this small keychain knife.  I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys.  The one keyring it comes with will cause the knife to sit perpendicular to your keys. adding bulk."
3,"In these stories everybody smokes.  The courtesy of offering a pack of cigarettes is common. The characters are classic 50s people. as are the social proprieties. The illustrations are highly representative of the 50s science/fiction dime novel. and the magazines of that time. Although he was not the first to deal with the principle of multiple time lines. I think he was the first to base a series of stories on the concept. These have not aged well. but the science behind these stories are still valid. I will have to admit I read these stories after Fuzzy Sapiens. his masterpiece. and one of the top books of all time. certainly in this genre. We lost a great storyteller prematurely when he left us."
8,"We were having a grand time with this toy. and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance.  That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who &#34;Chucked it&#34; as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever... Ok. so that's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there. but buyer beware: You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car.  It really depends on where you live."
3,"I have never read this author but I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would gladly read another.The disfigured Hero's fear. pain and pride were wonderfully described and I felt myself wanting to reach out and gently touch his scars to reassure him -at exactly the same times Aidan touched Warwick. Don't get me wrong. Warwick was a brutally strong hot male character-but we were so privy to his thoughts within this story that we began to get those protective feelings Aidan acquired. We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you! She is a one WOMAN rescue squad that is the perfect match for our mysterious- masked hired guard Warwick. The sex between them is hot and wicked as well.enjoy!"
3,"This was an excellent. fast paced story that I didn't want to put down.There is a small issue with formatting that I almost deducted a star for. but I just couldn't do it as it did not hinder my reading much at all. It's only a matter of sentences dropping to a new line in the middle and not having page breaks between chapters.  Annoying. but not debilitating.The characters here are vivid and believable. The writing is succinct and graphic.This was a steal for $.99. I will definitely be watching out for more from this author."
4,"There's so much debate about the violence of this movie that it may scare some from watching it. But Mel Gibson makes it known that he doesn't want to elaborate on the physical suffering of Jesus as much as he wants to elaborate on the courage and strength of Jesus to do God's will. Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe. But the last scene of Jesus resurrection gives hope and almost purges those feelings of despair. This movie depicts true Love and Hope through even the most darkest hours. Other than some rather cheesy scenes and some overdramatic irony the movie should remain a classic for it's indie aspirations and block buster accomplishments."
9,"I have carried one of these on my belt for over 25 years and recently left mine on the tailgate of my pickup and drove off without thinking. I lasted three days bare of my Victorinox and couldn't go any longer. The price is a little spendy but trust me you won't even give it a second thought after you use this tool for a month. It is extremely well made. engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants. I don't go 24 hours that I don't use this tool at least a half dozen times. It has it all and then some. The steel in the blades is exquisite. The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp. I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw. Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime."
8,"This is my second review for Duckworth and I still feel that this duck is worth every penny. It was the favorite toy of our dog that died at age 13 and it is the favorite toy of our 5 yr old dog that we adopted after the first one died. The dogs couldn't be more different in personality. but they both have loved this toy to pieces. literally. It doesn't get chewed apart but is so well loved that it looks terrible and is starting to fall apart. so we buy two each Christmas and save the second one for mid summer when it is time for a new Duckworth to appear."
5,"Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar. and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway. it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands. but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
5,"I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use. I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own. And every student I've ever had. has one on their guitar as well. They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding. They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time. they can be easily removed and relocated. After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. No matter how many picks you store. or for how long. the spring action loader never loses its resistance. I highly recommend these. I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product. If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks. this is the product for you."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
6,"I think it's a little pricey for 200 sheets. but then again with Prime that includes 'free' shipping.  We use a ton of paper at our tutoring center. and I prefer the wide ruled for my students. especially the ones in elementary school.  The wide ruled lines give the young writers more room to express themselves in words and numbers.  For math activities I'll sometimes turn the paper horizontal with the lines running up and down. This can help students visualize columns and be better able to list numbers one below the other.These sheets of paper have red margins on both sides for convenience of application. For those who look for it. the Mead filler paper has the  certified sourcing imprimatur."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
3,"Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends. werewolves. vampires. the like. as beings of an alternate dimension. Gates allow them passage to out world. Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down. building such as Stonehenge. the Indian mounds of the Americas. and other such structures around the world. But as humans spread and built. those impediments were destroyed. weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world. In their own dimension. they are far down the food chain. In our world. they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing. cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests. cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains. there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families. the Masons. from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event. and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
6,"This is traditional wide-ruled. three-hole paper. Exactly the quality you expect from Mead--decent thickness with clear. crisp lines and edges--and ideal for grade-school to middle-school writers. If wide-ruled notebook paper is what you. or your child. needs. this is as good as. or better than. any other option. With one caveat ... It's the kind of thing best bought on sale. because off-season or single pack purchase can be absurdly pricey: 4 to 5 times the price of the same goods at better times (like back to school events)."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together. it shows up very easily on gift wrap. being all shiny.  The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts..  doesnt attract or reflect light. so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape. Very simple and it works.Con:  this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use. but it can be used as such.  Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
4,"Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai."
1,"I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks.  I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month.  That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back.  What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same. 1800. and my body. which fights me to gain. will be happy with the lower weight.  One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol. it's doesn't work anymore.  I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis.  I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate."
1,"Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos. with sound. field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years. and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine. fast. priced fair. new in the package."
5,"My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones. I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars. The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage.One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely. but works with the others flawlessly. I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it's price. To me. the warranty is worth it because of the price. I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality. but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion."
3,"For whatever reason. Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The 'Tales of...' are great in that they explain background characters. However.Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work. this is mostly a book of action. not intricate plot development. In fact. the story ends with an exciting twist. but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love. or included a really interesting plot twist. Also. just to note. this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version."
8,"THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS!  I bought this for my Airedale's crate at night.  I thought it would be nice to radiate a little heat  (during these chilly winter months)  under her top towel. and on top of her cushion and blanket.  SHE LOVES IT. and has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning!!!  This disc is very hard. but she doesn't seem to mind (and I put it under a thick towel).  It actually stays warm for about 8-10 hours.  and I microwave only 5 mins and 15 secs. which is slightly under the recommended time for my microwave.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
3,"After seeing the recent major movie. I was prompted to pursue re-reading the original series of novels. I found them to be highly entertaining and as captivating as when I read them long ago. The writing is good. if a bit 'dated'. but Burroughs can still hold your attention. His writting may seem a little juvenile to some but I (at 70+) was thrilled time and again as I read them on my KIndle. I recommend them to all who simply wish to read a series purely for the entertainment value."
9,"It is convenient and packs up well for car camping.  The stove gets very hot. and is great for boiling water.The stove does not do 'simmer' particularly well.  Be careful with anything that needs lower heat settings.  Using a cast iron pan or high quality aluminum or copper clad pan helps.  Attempting pancakes. eggs or a side dish requires very close attention.I would say that overall this is a good value. but there are better units available.It does have good wind resistance to it. which is a definite plus outside."
10,"Other reviewers are correct. this is a terrific little sander with one problem. the switch is tricky to operate.  The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best.  Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task. this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production.  Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent. noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders.  I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable (with no dust collection) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC.  Highly recommended."
8,"If my dogs like like the taste of Purina One and they eat it. then there is not more that I can say except I trust Purina products. I am always looking out for the best products at a reasonable price and through the years Purina products have provided food that is healthy and balanced. at a reasonable price. and most importantly. my animals like the taste. Most of our dogs and cats live to their teen years. with two of our cats living to 19 and 20 years old. this I think I it in part due to Purina products."
12,"I bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience.  I was not disappointed.  It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless. since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also. the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me. mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better. but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall. a very simplistic. yet functional. design that works well."
8,"My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT.  Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received.  The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal.  It is all angular and sharp points. My dog wouldn't even touch it.  She even know the difference.This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we wouldn't know the difference.  I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them.  From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance.  Very upset with this kind of business practice.  All nylabone products ARE NOT equal."
8,"I use it to pre-treat my carpet in heavy stained spots. but it's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there. Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again (no way. it takes too much time). I just spray this and clean it off. I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula. not to mention its scent is even better. If you own a puppy or a pet that isn't fully housebroken yet. buy it. You'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner."
5,"Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder... Aquila seems to be the most popular now. I have used both and I am satisfied with both...I play the soprano. concert. tenor. and baritone. Each one different in it on right...Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO.  Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times:))))"
4,"This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful.  For many. myself included. the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity.  The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify. and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith.  Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible. gritty reality.  This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment. not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.  I am not a Christian. but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film.  This is not a film to 'enjoy.' but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind."
9,"tips:1. the lantern burns brighter on white Coleman fuel2. gasoline is A LOT more dirty then Coleman fuel so try to pre-filter the gas before use.3.gasoline will gum up the lantern in storage VERY quickly.so dump out the gasoline after your use.4.if you burn gasoline a lot make sure to pack an extra generator(a lantern part)because they tend to plug up much quicker then with Coleman fuel. the generator is cleanable if soaked in parts cleaner or 'seafoam'.5. if you need 'directional light' cut a thick foil pie pan to the same dimensions as the globe.but make it only wrap half way around the globe(it will stay in place by being pinched between the shade and the mantel metal bottom. this will give you about 200 watts of directed light....perfect for Sasquatch hunting or signaling the mother-ship.that being said; these are great lanterns and simple enough to repair and pass down to your kids....a rare product characteristic nowadays."
12,"This game was a very fun game. You basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings.. each one leading you into a different world... and in every world... you have to find 7 stars... (one of em is the 100 coin star where you need to collect 100 coins then it pops up it's the hardest star to get)there's 16 worlds in all... most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it.. This game right here is history... It's one of Nintendo's biggest hits... and when you buy this game you'll soon find out why:)"
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
1,"The National Brand of the best working Lactase Tablets - they get the job done--i.e. preventing embarassing dashes for the nearest lavatory. which can be a pain if you're taking the train. particularly as it tends to be rather drafty in there and on cold mornings any trip where one has to run down a long series of connecting cars just to partially disrobe to read a newspaper and pretend that's all you went there for- which allows you to be comfortable and not have to make the weaving sway-bumping into others -as you fairly leap down the cars to the necessary--only to find it &#34;occupied&#34; - is a good thing to have on hand to use instead- make sure you take it WITH the dairy product - not after and not more than 1 minute before eating ...(heed my advice on this -or- don't say i didn't warn you)."
6,"I've loved the trimline phone ever since I got my first phone more than 20 years ago.  Then. the trimline was a real. Bell System. telephone.  Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones. it still has the great. comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset. which makes it an excellent choice.  I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone. but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T; version.If you read the other reviews. you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.  Yet. here we are in late November 2004. and its still around.  I'm guessing (could be wrong here) that this phone will be around forever. even though AT&T; no longer promotes it on their web-site."
5,"I bought this set mainly because I wanted a cheap micro-fiber cloth to polish off my guitars.  For the price of just a microfiber cloth. this set throws in a polish.The cloth is just what I wanted. It is soft and I feel good rubbing it on my instrument. I wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate -- mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear.  The polish is just that -- it is works to bring out a shine. but it is not a cleaner.  You also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish; there is a bit of wax in there and it is not string-friendly."
3,"This story is very short (think novella). but it it's very well-written and the plot moves at a nice. quick pace. This is a great. easy read for a few hours (especially for the beach or that plane trip).The story revolves around an estranged couple. a misunderstanding. and a cute and funny revelation at the end.I don't really understand the negative/mediocre reviews. because I personally loved this story.  I get that everyone has their own opinion. but if you're a fan of adult historical fiction. you will definitely enjoy this!"
3,"The story idea was sweet. with a hunky editor who is trying to convince his prized writer to start writing erotic novels.  Given that this is a new genre for her. they engage in a little erotic research under the premise of helping her writing.  I liked the characters and the scenarios. but I expected a bit more eroticism and a little less sweet.  It seemed as though the sex scenes were a bit on the vanilla side compared to other books in this genre.  Still. a light and entertaining read."
9,"People complain about the lavender smell.  Yes it is STRONG when you smell right from the bottle.  Actually using it as a soap/shampoo it leaves a very faint smell.  You just have a nice clean smell with a hint of the lavender.  I have used Dove body wash for years and this is a much better product.  It doesn't have the lotion that products like Dove contain. but it has a really nice. clean. refreshing feel and smell that is hard to beat.  No lotion-like residue like the Dove... but still the skin is pretty moisturized.It doesn't foam up quite as much as most commercial soaps. but you actually use about the same. or less. of this product to get the same level of cleanliness.  Plus being fair trade. environmentally friendly. and having an ingredient list that is actually comprehensible is a huge plus.I will never go back to Dove... and will stick with this unless I end up finding something superior."
5,"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo. but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos.  important to take it off when not in use so the 'rubber' does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another."
6,"The tape - at first I wondered: 'How can this be different?'. The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss (satin if you will) finish. For a 'tape collector' I guess it is slightly between 'magic' and clear tape.* Not a big deal to me and most people. but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered 'photo safe' I guess that means it won't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has."
4,"Are we Jaded? Rate this product. . . We EXPECT what we purchases to BE.  To work without difficulty. without oops. without interruptions. to provide the intended use.

1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper.

Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
8,"We have used Frontline Plus for several years on our dogs and never had an issue.  Never seen a single flea or tick on them.  I have a lab who loves to dig and roll around in the grass and sand. and I haven't had any problems.  Last year we decided to try the new generic equivalent to save a few bucks since we are buying for 2 dogs.  BIG mistake.  We pulled off several ticks.  As soon as we could. we went right back to FP and haven't looked back.  It is worth the little extra money (there is not THAT huge of a difference in price) to be sure our dogs are safe from fleas. ticks and all the other nasties out there."
1,"I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War. many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door. I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor. a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;"
1,"Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating; he was so grateful; 'He was like Mom it really does work. thank you!'  Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago. raising young children. working and just don't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems.  Anyway. it worked for him...Be sure that whom ever uses this product. that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1. Use at night before bed (do this twice in a row)2. Then use every other nightDon't quote me verbatim. just read the direction for yourself before using. as I'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product.  If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product...Good Luck!"
12,"This is the origanal Gameboy Color its not some crappy SP this was amazing due to all the colors on the screen and the size was better than a gamegear for sure. Most of the titles are great and take full advantage of the colors  many people say that it's not that great only because there is no backlight.but who cares anyone remember the Gameboy Light? And how did that turn out. horrible nintendo did mot want to take another risk like that and they were right backlights and graphics don't make a game console*cough gamegear cough* its the games for the console and these games are awesome so if you want dust off your old library of Gameboy color games go for it youll be sorry if you don't"
1,"B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device. which puts others to shame.  In fact. the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used. but even at first brush. it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it. and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you. Amazon. for making this available to me at an 'irreteethable' price."
1,"I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others. I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer. so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more. you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation."
9,"This thing is amazing! I go on river floats basically every other weekend in the summer and this is used as the beer barge where we keep our shoes. coolers. keys etc. Not only does it admirably hold all the weight loaded into it. it has so far remained completely damaged even though people repeatedly throw crushed beer cans and bottle caps in it. I've only used it a couple times as a person floater but it had ample space for me (6'2&#34; -185lbs) and I didn't feel like it was going to sink. I've also not used the oars yet. If I were going to make this purchase again. I probably would look at getting something that could hold two people for me and a friend to go play around in the creeks etc but I'm not sure that they make anything as cheap as I want that does all that. I highly recommend this boat and the full Intex line to anyone looking for river float craft."
9,"I like the Speedo Hydrospex Swim Goggles. They have a snug. relatively comfortable (for googles) fit and won't leak if you follow the instructions on the package. These Speedos look good in the water and provide decent visibility. I find the tinted versions too dark to see underwater.  I have used these clear goggles for a year now. and after about 30 uses.  there are no durability issues so far. These are nice goggles at an affordable price. better than the cheap ones I had as a kid that leaked all the time!"
3,"Rachel has come back to Cougar Falls in search of a new beginning. The legacy from her beloved Aunt Charlotte couldn't have come at a more fitting time.Burke Chastell just wants Rachel to collect her inheritance and sell him the land so they can find the totem that protects Cougar Falls before the rest of the world discovers not only that it exists. but all of its secrets.Rachel's Totem by Marie Harte is HOT!  I enjoyed this story more than expected. Since it is part of an ongoing series. I was afraid I would be lost and confused. but I wasn't. I had no problem following the story and motivations of the characters. There was an unexpected m&eacute;nage. but it was definitely a fun one. I will be checking out more of Ms. Harte's stories after this one.Elysiareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
5,"I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes. plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to. is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly. there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6' pop filter.  If you don't. you'll wish you did."
6,"Make note that this product is for laser printers!  Great product for office or at home use.  If you have a mass mailing to do. you will find Avery templates and labels extremely useful.  These products come with Easy Peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier.  Anytime you have to print labels. look to these Avery labels.  A good value for your money.  You can address 750 envelopes with just one package.  Do you know how much time mail merge. a printer. and some avery labels will save you.  You won't be disappointed!"
3,"GREAT ADDITION TO THE LEARNING CURVE OF THE KINDLE.  Just finished reading the third edition of this book. I was surprised about the little tidbits that I didn't know about!!! My Kindle is used only for downloading books via either my computer or Whispernet from Amazon and of course reading them. I am not interested in using the Kindle for anything else so a lot of the book does not apply to my uses. But those that do are worth the small amount charged for this book. It is a bargain. Even my dogs are happy that I have converted over to the  Kindle since the pathways they use were growing smaller with each new book brought home."
4,"I was pleased to see in the extra features that Dr. Ben Carson was on-hand to advise in the production of this biographical retelling of his autobiography. He is a gifted speaker and writer. but I had hoped that they got the story right. Read the book first if you can; it's a page-turner. The movie leaves out some of the faith stories of Dr. Carson. making it a draw to a wider audience. But make no mistake. Dr. Carson credits God with all of his success. pointing out that it was his Christ-following mother that prayed for and encouraged him to reach his potential. taking him to church and teaching him in the way he should go--even as a single parent."
12,"This game is really fun. but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more. One thing that annoys me about this game is that you can't look behind you. I pressed every button and I can't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming. So nine out of ten times. I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64? It's still a nice little game. a little pricey. but still nice to have in your N64 collection."
10,"Great miter saw.  Lots of capacity and lots of nice features.  The tall sliding fence is great. just make sure to slide it out of the way during bevel cuts.  The supplied blade is fine for general work but youll want to upgrade if you plan on doing any work requiring a quality cut.  This saw is easy to adjust. just read the manual as it tells you how to adjust everything on the saw.  Adjusting it took me all of five minutes and has stayed true ever since.  My only gripes concern the cost of the accessories.  They are ridiculously expensive and should be included considering the price of this saw.  I also recomend purchasing this saw at your local home center as DeWalts packaging jobs leaves a lot to be desired. One piece of cardboard is all that secures this big saw inside the box.  Other than those minor gripes this is the best 12' saw on the market."
3,"This book was my least favorite of the series. It was lacking detail in the beginning and the heroine's purpose seemed too manufactured to me. I also couldn't get my head wrapped around the alternating first and third person accounts chapter to chapter. The static characters were a little too static for me (there could have been a little more explanation for some of the behaviors or snootier snubs. And none of them ever really seemed to be resolved).The ending seemed a little scraped together as well. Having already read others in the series. I know this is just a fluke. I will say I liked the characters though. in better development of their back stories or resolutions I would have been more apt to give four stars. Still. it was a decent read. But not one I would be in a hurry to re-read."
3,"All in all a great read. I would have given this book five stars except there were some repetitive thought processes in the beginning that had me saying 'alright already - I get it... he wants to stay but he's afraid she'll recognize him and reject him or turn him in'. (reminders would have been okay. but perhaps less wordy ones) However. by nearly half way in the book it moves away from that. There's plenty of action and suspense throughout. and a nice romance to boot."
4,"The acting was fine. but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown. covered with blood. hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone. Jesus Christ or anybody else. taking such an ass kicking. What was it. 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here. Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh. there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds. sunlight through a hole in his hand. Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday."
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
4,"This is a great Woody Allen film.However. it is only 85 minutes long. just like every other release.The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.It is widescreen. but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.All special features are only written text and only in Korean. so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.It is not.It is. however. a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release."
5,"Long story short. this string set has a strong metallic character. which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it. but for me. absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar. so by its nature it sounds mellow. warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out. I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position. WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes. it is that bad. you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line. I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so. definitely avoid this string."
10,"I purchased this sander nearly one year ago and can't say I have any complaints about it. The dust collection works surprisingly well. though if the bag isn't pushed in all the way it has a tendency to fall out (fault of the user. not the tool). It isn't unbearably loud although I still wear my ear muffs when using it. The vibration in the hand is low. and it does a superb job at what it is designed to do - sand. I don't know where the components are made. but at least the tool itself is assembled in USA which is more than I can say for the 18V Li-Ion drill and impact driver combo that I have as well (Makita brand) which is made in China. This is a purchase you won't regret."
6,"I never oiled my previous shredder and paid the price after about a year.  This time I bought the oil at the same time I bought the shredder.  Now I oil the shredder fairly often. maybe even too often.  The only issue I have with this product is that it's a bit messy when you &#34;pour&#34; the oil onto the shredder blades.  I cut the top of the oil container as small as I could. but oil still manages to come out too fast and get on the shredder body when I oil.  No big deal as I just wipe the excess with a paper towel. but it's worth noting."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
4,"After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions. and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three. but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks...."
6,"This is easily the best gift wrapping tape I have ever used. It is transparent. of course. but not shiny. like some competing brands I have used. UnlikeScotch Magic(TM) Tape 810-3PK. 3/4-inch x 1296 Inches. 3-Pack(which is also fantastic). this tape doesn't look cloudy on top of wrapping paper; it really is just hard to see. The adhesive is strong enough to hold gift wrap together. but is also forgiving enough to allow you to peel it off and readjust if need to. All in all. this is a great product."
3,"Many post apocalyptic stories are very grim. This one isn't. It has a lovely cast of characters. of beings who are trying to build new lives.The pace of the story is easy. like walk on the beach. The story starts with a wolf/human who is banished because the elders of his tribe are afraid of his ideas. On his journey he meets others: a young boy. an orphan and artist. whose body is damaged by the pollution of his former city and a female dolphin/siryn who has been helping the boy to survive and of course a very intelligent dog that they name Misschief.Many other new characters are slowly introduced.The book is infused with the love and healing power of nature. The characters are well defined and they all have a purpose. that they gradually discover."
6,"This 3 Ring Binder is well designed. Avery took what is wrong with most other binders and came up with excellent solutions such as the Pins for the Binder Ring connections. Other binders use V connections which don't always work well. I also like the Single Button to release the Rings. The curvature of the Rings makes it easier to handle large volumes of paper.The Labels are also Premium quality but I won't be using them with a printer or the free Avery software. Only reason is that I don't make that many Binder labels at any one time. But I have used other Avery label products with Avery's free software and they always worked well.If you want an above average 3 Ring Binder that can be used frequently and smoothly then I highly recommend this Avery product."
8,"I typically pre-treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning.  This is a ok pre-treat but I likeBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 ozbetter.  I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge.  I've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time.  For lighter carpets. I would recommend theBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 oz."
3,"I became attached to the characters. I liked the series for the most part. I only had 2 complaints. The characters kept saying that they weren't monsters. that they are the same people they were before immortality (which I agree). However. the author kept calling it the dark gift. I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing. I'm not sure how to put into words. but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example. Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this. I got the point the 1st 2 times they explained their thoughts and feelings.  For the most part. I liked the series. Just these 2 points bothered me."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
2,"I've been using this almost daily for about a month. Easy to use. easy to clean. and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints. except that the bowl feels kind of thin. like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl. but I guess only time will tell. Other than that. no complaints. and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up. and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it. but hindsight is 20/20."
10,"I had this for my first table saw when I started woodworking. No matter how long I spent adjusting it. I couldn't get the rear of the fence to lock solid. or to lock in the same place every time. VERY frustrating when you're trying to make pieces of plywood with square corners.This is not the same caliber tool as Makita's hand tools.It may work OK for carpenters. but compared to woodworking. they don't need any kind of precision. For that. a good contractor saw like a Jet would be good. But do spend the money for the upgraded fence. The stock fences on those are garbage too. If you really need a lightweight. compact saw. look at the DeWalt and the Bosch."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
2,"If you're not a cook. then you probably won't have a use for this. but anyone in the search of a superior vegetable peeler. look no further. I've had mine for over two years. and it's working as well as the day I purchased it. It doesn't dull. it peels efficiently. it's safe. light. easy to handle. easy to clean. and doesn't rust. It works well with potatoes. carrots. cucumbers. and zucchinis. I've never tried chocolate. though. It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try. I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,"I was totally amazed to find out this uses NiCad batteries that suffer from battery memory and are horrid.  I had to call Eureka and get new batteries sent. the first customer service agent was horrible and made me call back 24 hours later in the event the batteries suddenly started to work.  NiCad batteries are horrible.  The Vac itself is great. but the batteries make it not worth owning.Among rechargeable battery technologies. NiCad rapidly lost market share in the 1990's. to NiMH and Li-ion batteries; market share dropped by 80% for good reason.  With the battery technology today there is no reason Eureka should have used them except to be cheap."
5,"I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD&G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great. I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing."
5,"I bought this recently and I love it. Why?  It has no &#34;smell&#34;. it leaves no residue on your hands. it's very &#34;light&#34; but yet it cleans. shines. and polishes your guitar beautifully.  It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish. it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors. This is fantastic stuff. If you own a guitar this is the best product out there. But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson. I was very suprised that it was this effective. This little bottle goes a long way. I have already polished all of my guitars and my friend's guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left. If you need to polish your guitar look no further. This is your best choice."
6,"It might seem silly to be excited about labels but I am. I've been looking for labels that aren't a pain in the you-know-what and I've found them.These labels are return address label sized (80/sheet). I'll be using them for that as well but my initial use is for 'reorder' labels on products I sell. The printing is clear and smudge-proof. important for labels with small print that might be exposed to liquids or creams.What I like best about these is the Easy Peel feature. which will save much time and aggravation when I'm label several items (or envelopes) at once. I'll be ordering these again but with 80 labels per sheet. it may be a while."
5,"I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  I guess this kit works okay. but it's hard to use.  It will probably last my entire lifetime.  I think a smaller kit would have been better.  You really need to remove the strings when you use it. so you have to take off all the strings.  I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings. so I had to change my habits.  If you have a guitar without a truss rod. that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings. since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time. and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  I'm no expert. but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  However. since I love my guitar. I use it anyway."
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
9,"I've owned my XLT since shortly after it came out. and it is absolutely the best knife I've ever owned. even better than the SwissChamp I'd carried for 10 years prior.  I work as a computer tech. and this knife has about 90% of the tools I need to fix a computer. all in a (relatively) small package that I can carry in my pocket.  It's got things like Torx and Hex bits. and the bit driver is exactly the perfect size for tightening the little nuts on either side of a D-SUB connector (VGA. Parallel. Serial port. etc).  Even the little straight pin has come in handy for resetting PDAs.  I have used every single tool on this knife except the fish scaler.  Heck. even the toothpick has proven useful!"
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
2,"I live in an apartment. so I wanted something that I could hang over the door instead of drilling/nailing things into the wall for me to fill later when I move out. It was really hard to find! This comes with the hardware to mount if you want to. which is nice if/when I go somewhere more permanent. but honestly. hanging it over the door is working great. Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part. I ended up using a hammer which caused some of the white paint to come off. but you really can't see it and it doesn't affect function. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
8,"My mom's beloved Bichon Frise is the family pet.  The grandchildren all love her and we'd be lost without her.  Unfortunately. she is highly allergic to flea bites.  She also cannot tolerate a flea collar.  We have tried everything for this poor. sensitive dog and finally found Frontline Plus!  We apply it every 45 days because she's mainly an indoor dog and only goes out for using the bathroom.  The vet suggested every 45 days because of her sensitivities.  It works wonders!  We just started using it May of this year (2008) and she has not had a single reaction to fleas for the first time in the 10 years she's been alive.Every dog should have Frontline Plus applied to keep them flea free!  We no longer have to put her on allergy medication.  It's been such a wonderful product for her."
5,"Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board. this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs. combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further. with the transformer being well away from the board. there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?"
10,"I have two desktop high intensity lamps - one I bought a few years ago. and one a recent purchase. The older lamp failed about 3 months ago. and I replaced it with the new one thinking the older one was finished. Then when the newer lamp blew a bulb I decided to get a set of these bulbs to see if it would work again. Replacing the blown bulb with a new one from this package took a minute or two (being careful not to touch the bulb with my fingers). and the new lamp was back to working. So I decided to try one these bulbs in my old (presumed dead) desk lamp. After carefully installing the new bulb my old lamp was back to life. They are both still working. and I am delighted with this purchase."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
2,"It's a stick vacuum. folks. So it won't do much more on carpet than collect surface debris (like any stick vac. it's not designed to. though it does have a &#34;carpet&#34; setting) or solve big cleaning problems. But it will. from solid floors. remove crumbs. most dust bunnies smaller than bowling balls. dog and cat hair. and -- for those like us who have canaries or other pet birds -- all 2.000 feathers that each one of those little darlings drops during their annual molt.What I like best is that this model comes with TWO batteries. so I can keep one in the stick vac and one in the charger so the help I need is always at hand. For the price. I like this machine."
2,"I've used a Premium grade. Innova 8 Qt. for years. It is way too big for every day. single person use. The Presto works decently. but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop. catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid. the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height. the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top. but not the sides."
10,"I purchased this saw because I was building a 600 sq ft deck and really needed something that would work well. What a great investment this was. I can't begin to tell you how many pieces of wood we had to cut and the saw did it with ease. I am extremely happy with the results and very happy that I followed the reviews of others before I purchased the saw. Even after completing the deck. I still don't even have to change the blade. I also purchased the reciprocating saw from DeWalt which also worked great. You get what you pay for and it's worth every penny. especially when you don't have tax or delivery."
3,"I liked the premise behind the plot. mental attachment between wolf and man. as I like this type of interaction. Unfortunately. for me. the original promise of the plot never quite materialized and in fact ended up being chaotic for me with an unexpected side-step into shape shifting halfway through the book.For me. the book almost works well but doesn't quite make it. The plot premise didn't deliver quite what I anticipated. the characterization was a little predictable with secondary characters not well developed as individuals.I did finish the book but admit to skimming quite a lot of the last half. It wasn't a bad book. just not  my kind of read. Bland would probably be the best way to describe the book for me."
9,"If you Want a decent scope that can stand the pounding it takes from a .308. then this is your scope. I previously bought a Barska scope that  shook to pieces after 12 shots.  After 3 hours of shooting. and more than 60 rounds. I shot my best pattern of the day at 100 yards. and I am not that great a shot ! The adjustments are not as smooth as a $4.000 scope. bit it is not a 4k scope. and bottom line is. it worked fine for me. Two thumbs up For Bushnell."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
9,"Just so nobody gets confused here. this is a very small pocket knife. To be worn on a key chain. Nothing remotely what is considered EDC (every day carry). But here is why I got it: You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc. Scissors. a nail file and what I like the best....tweezers and a toothpick. None of the high priced Leatherman etc. multitools have tweezers. and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be."
4,"If you want to view an interpretation of Christ that reduces him to little more than a helpless idiot. watch this movie.  If you actually respect him. avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing. then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here. he is portrayed as a victim. dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there. just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message. love. pacificm. or teachings. it's a sensationalist view of his suffering. which doesn't fit well with the Christ story."
4,"Kudos to RareFlixNClassic for reliable and expedeiant service. ordered (03 March 2010) same time as other products. I recieved this one 9 March 2010 and as of 10 March 2010 Amazon still has not shipped the other iteams oreder with this one. All with the super saver shipping including this one. Quick shipping. Recieved product as advetised in new condition. The movie it self is a classic anti culture movie ot its time. I like the movie for what it is and you get to see Nickolsen from his earlyer years in the buissness."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
12,"Probably one of the best games for RPG players.  However. too expensive currently (as of August 2006).  I bought the PC version and the Playstation version years back and still have them.  The PC version does look better especially during fight scenes.  Unfortunately. for use on Windows XP you have to get a software patch for later in the game (chocobo race).  Great great game.  I would say 'shame on you' to the sellers that are charging so much for the games but I understand their reasons.Find it cheap. buy it. play it. enjoy it!"
4,"The informational content is superb but it is presented in a combination of psudeo talk show and lecture format. In addition. Mr. Barton speaks very fast and dispenses a large volume of information in a short amount of time. The result is that the episodes tend to be dry and boring. Adding to these difficulties is the fact the DVDs include the promotions for the series from when it aired on TV. As a result the episodes are interupted approximately every 8 minutes with what amounts to a commercial for the series. This gets exceptionally tiring after a short period of time. While I would wish that every high school student in the nation along and every adult citizen study this series. I think that anyone who is not seriously interested in the subject matter will find watching it to be a tedious affair."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
9,"This pedometer has a clock which resets the count every day and keeps a seven day history.  I just leave it on my belt and don't have to worry about resetting it or checking it right after a walk.  My wife has a pedometer with manual reset and she never remembers to use it.The sensitivity adjustment helps avoid false readings from car vibrations. and the aerobic steps feature is useful to determine how much exercise I'm actually getting.It is very durable.  I've worn it every day for over a year with no problems.  It also has a small enough size that I hardly notice when I'm wearing it.In summary. the combination of durability. features. size. and price makes the Omron HJ-105 an excellent choice."
2,"I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules. you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally. it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA. otherwise. highly recommend."
4,"Woody Allen's directorial debut. and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know. he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered. this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure. it has some korean styled packaging. but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie. not a commercial movie.  Beware. this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap."
6,"I recently went through my filing cabinet and purged all of the old crap that was cluttering the drawers.  The problem is that I now had a stack of very usable folders that were 'tattooed' by the old labels.  You can't tear the old labels off without damaging the tab and if you put new labels over them the writing on the old label shows through.These new Avery File Folder Labels are absolutely perfect for this situation: you can place them over old labels and they completely block out the writing on the old labels.  Problem solved!!Nice and heavy-duty. these are excellent labels.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day. so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say. Hi!') feel free to post it below.Thanks.Claire"
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
9,"I picked this multitool because it has the best combination of features for me: I really like having a saw. phillips head and scissors. All of the tools are well designed. The saw cuts aggressively in both directions and all of the blades came paper slicing sharp and are easy to restore. It is also surprisingly lightweight for its size; unlike Leathermans which are also great but for different reasons. If I had any complaints it would be that some of the tools are slightly difficult to access (particularly the hook - which I don't use anyways) and I think that there is space for one more tool on the bottom."
3,"I thought this would be a great book after reading the description.  But. the author has put way too much filler in and that just turned me off. There are also lots of misinformation as to how things work out. For example:  He ambled!  Her senses hummed.  Women don't growl in dismay. they likely would sign or moan. Men don't glide. cattle bawl. they don't bray.  Mules and donkey bray!  And on and on.  I think the author had a good idea for a story. but she just had a first novel or juvenile attempt at this one. I got it free and I am happy at that.  Cannot recommend it.  Explicit sex is also a turn off."
10,"This drill is an absolute work horse.  Besides doing lots of hole drilling in different materials. I've used this drill to mix thinset mortar. grout. and joint compound....it just churns away and barely gets warm.  After burning up two Dewalt drills. I decided to go with Milwaukee.  The keyed chuck is the best on the market and you never need to worry about it slipping once you've secured it properly.  The drill has a lot of torque. so use the additional handle and hold on tight!  Great drill....great price!"
5,"In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality. I've never broken or worn out the capo. I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars. The spring tension remains strong after several years. which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing. The only problem I have with them. they seem to disappear when I'm not looking. I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use. Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty. it cleans easily."
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
4,"Love seeing these cartoons in PERFECT re-mastered condition and bright colors.  Over the years. they have aired on channels including CARTOON NETWORK in washed out 16mm prints.  I would have preferred that the original titles remain. BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode.  All in all...a GREAT DVD set!  For this box set. CLASSIC MEDIA also re-did the covers for VOLUME 1 &amp; 2 and they are much IMPROVED!  Rick Goldschmidt  RANKIN/BASS Historian"
5,"Well built.  The adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about 8 or 9 degree increments.  (10 possible positions between upright and horizontal)  Best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck. I'm using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the  stand to give  me a bit more room.  But there is no counter-weight here so its best used at shallow angles.  If I was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar. or if on-stage energy has you moving a lot more. I would opt for a boom stand instead."
9,"These are hands down the best kids goggles out there as they stay put on little faces.  The large coverage area also seems to give kids more security in the water and also leaves less chances of them falling off.  The material is tacky without being sticky. which is great for holding on to little kids in motion.  The many colors are also nice so that each kid can have their own color.  They aren't indestructible and the lens can scratch so a bit of care is a good idea. but as far as kids goggles go. this is a good investment to make."
2,"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup. 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen."
9,"As a shampoo it's great. although my hair feels rubbery during the first lather after the second and a towel dry it feels really soft. If you have to shampoo regularly. every other day should be fine with this stuff.As a body wash it's great. the tingle is really noticeable...especially if you leave the lather in between your legs for too long it can get uncomfortably tingly so unless that's your thing. beware.It lasts a LOOOONG time. It's called magic because of how easily the oil lathers up. half a palm full should be enough to wash your hair and body easily.The smell is pretty strong compared to the others but I'm pretty sure it depends on the batch. the bottle I'm using now isn't overpowering but a lot of people have gotten bottles with too much peppermint"
2,"No assembly and ready to go out of box.  2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.  Unit does not have to be disassembled to empty. a convenient drain spout.After first use. waste water came out black. and an immediate elimination of pet odor in the stairway.Small size and light weight make it idea for immediate spill clean ups.Unit is built top heavy with a large handle. this balances the weight when solution is in the unit.Cord could be longer and retractable."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
9,"This ball provides grip and feel for ball handlers and shooters with a composite cover material.  I have 2 boys that lllooovvvvee basketball and this ball is their favorite.  This ball emulates the feel of leather. that also offers the durability need for mixed surface use. It seems like they had ball handlers and shooters in mind when making this ball.  The ball has a wide channel design. suitable for indoors or outdoors use. the ball meets official NBA size and weight requirements.  Can really speak on the durablilty but for the most part. we are really impressed with this ball.  Buy it. you'll love it!"
2,"A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells.  It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact.  It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine.  The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end.  I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it."
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
9,"I bought this only for the odometer function. I just wanted to know how far I was riding each day . I usually ride only two different routes that cannot be verified by driving my car over the same route. ( dedicated bike trails ). It is really not a bad unit for the price. I don't need something that will last for years. Once I know the distance of the routes I could just un-install it if I wanted to.. Ordered on a Wedesday A.M. and it arrived on Thurdsay P.M..It took about 10 minutes to install and off I went. Tested on a route @ Lake Perris Ca. and I was riding 12 miles( assumed it was 10 ) . So if you are looking to buy one. just do it. It is very inexpensive and will probably last a long time if you are careful with it .."
6,"This Swingline Lite Classic Cut is a standard size cutter but is light weight so you can move it around if needed. It's nice to cut coupons or whatever else you may be doing like craft projects. It is easy to move around and store if you have the room. Because it was called &#8220;lite&#8221;. I thought it would be a smaller size but it's just lighter in weight than others that I've used. It still takes up quite a bit of room.It has measurement markings and a grid on the the cutting board to help with measuring and lining up your cutting projects.There is a locking mechanism for the arm which is nice. I have another one that you can not lock the arm in place and I worry about the safety of that one.I noticed that is states it is for the occasional 10-sheet cutting project so I think this would be suited to homework. coupons. etc but may not stand up to daily use in an office or classroom."
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
6,"I remember learning. back in 1st or 2nd grade. how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop. That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis. Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk. hand a couple of light pictures. and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light. inexpensive. durable and is handy to have around."
6,"I ship a lot of books and packages in re-used envelopes and packaging. In the past. I've always had to use an additional piece of paper. or a dark marker. to cover up the old address. That's not the case with Avery's shipping labels with TrueBlock technology.These amazing labels effectively cover up any existing label or writing. making it impossible to see the previous address. It might sound like a small feature. but for this shipper it's a time-saver.And. since they're the dependable Avery brand. I can simply enter the package number into my printing program and know that it will print the labels without fail. You can't go wrong."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
4,"This movie sets a new standard for subsequent Jesus films. I must confess that I was disposed to 'like' the film no matter what. but having seen it. I find it truly remarkable. It was not entertaining... It is a film for reflection. Gibson captures perfectly the sentiment that the 'Christ should suffer and die' (the Gospel according to Luke). And for who? All of us. One cannot expect to appreciate this movie if all one wants is a good flick. This film challenges Christians and non-Christians alike to reflect on the sufferings of Christ.As an aside. I would not take small children to this film (in fact. the crucifixion scenes in most films are too much for small children). And I would recommend that viewers read one of the gospels. if not all of the gospels. before viewing it. As it covers the last 12 hours of Christ's life. much can be gained from a close reading of the biblical texts."
8,"We have a standard poodle with a ball fetish. She loves (and this is not a strong enough word) tennis balls or anything that can be thrown and returned. We have a large backyard but when I throw the tennis ball (without the Chuckit). she just looks at me with an exasperated. 'Really?' The Chuckit allows me to throw the ball clear across our (did I mention large?) yard. I can throw it for a long time without ever getting a sore shoulder or arm and the BEST PART is that I never have to touch a slobbery. muddy ball. Picking the ball up with the Chuckit is very easy. as long as the dog isn't attacking the ball while I'm trying to get it off the ground.This is a highly recommended product. We've had three (ours stay outside and get chewed on and bent by the kids at some point). And I will continue to buy them as others wear out."
12,"This Game is Awsome...purely...AWSOME!!!! I has an OK 1 player made but... the multiplayer is just outstanding!! This is a great party game... You just can't stop playing. Personally. DK. Fox. Kirby are my Favorites...btw...if you set the damage in multiplayer to 200%. then hit players 1-3 times using DK's ^+B spcieal move. your opponent will FLY!!! AND I MEAN FLY!!! ;) My Friends hate this move!!! :) Also Fox's \/+B Special move. you can reflect all moves and attacks!!! and Kirby can suck players abilities and fall on them with his \/+B special move like a brick!!! You have to buy this game!! It is the best ever!!"
12,"Right off the bat. before it came out. you'd probably wonder how would you ever imagine Mario in 3D. Well. here's your answer: Mario 64.There's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each (Counting 100 coin stars). with stars for rewards. Those stars help you unlock more levels.At the time. no one ever saw anything like this before. Although the graphics look fairly primitive now. they were still eye candy for most Mario fans. especially back then.Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like: With a free camera. flawless control. and extremely playable environments.Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge. (SPOILER ALERT) If you do manage to get them all. you get to visit Yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you 100 lives along with an improved triple jump move.Overall. you know what I want you to do. so do it. Buy the game"
10,"I've had this Plate Joiner for about 5 years. When I first got it. I thought it was great. It made slots that I could put biscuits in and join stuff. However. the first time I used it to make a critical joint. the major shortcoming showed up. The slots are not parallel to the base. They are a little more parallel when using the fence. but I prefer using the base indexing method.Also. as many other reviewers have noted. the chip ejection chute gets clogged very easily. making it difficult to work cleanly."
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
9,"This is a great hockey net for the kids to use on the street or driveway. It's very sturdy and still light enough for my 8 year old to carry it around easily. The netting. the posts. and the sticks are all great quality for this price. This has a lot of bang for the buck. I liked it so much. I thought I was ordering two more (to keep at the in-laws) but instead I accidentally ordered  Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White which has these flimsy little posts and I know it'll end up broken in no time. At least I have one solid net to rely on and two crappy ones as spares. I HIGHLY recommend getting this one over the Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White!!"
6,"This product works as advertised. Avery has been in the label business a long time. and knows how to specialize. They make affordable labels. The most difficult part for me in using labels made for a printer is setting up the program that has the addresses on them. Word makes this a little easier. Once this is accomplished. the labels can be put in the printer. printer settings changed to accept them. and you have printed address labels. Much quicker than doing this by hand. and they look so much better!"
5,"Many reviews cover the pro's of this item. so I'll be short only to add that they are very sturdy (when install properly...suggestion:  find a wall stud and use 3' screws for heavier instruments).Used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strat's.  Haven't had an issue with any in the 4-5 months we've had them up.  On the electrics. we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable.The hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping.Wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
10,"This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm surprised Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws.  I was able to install it by myself. and I'm an old guy.  I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw. disconnected the bolt. and lowered it to the floor.  After that. the installation goes very easy and straightforward.  Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off. but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good.  Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw.  I recommend this accessory."
8,"Not the &#34;Ohhhhhh noooooooo!&#34; again! This toy gets to be very annoying because that's all it says but it's fun to see the look on the dog's face when Mr. Bill says it. This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog doesn't use the soft mouth. The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone. It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to. you just sew it back up. It's a fun toy but easy to break. This was the 3rd toy I've bought for the dog. She likes the &#34;Ohhhh noooo!!!&#34;"
3,"Deidre Nelson is back in Ventura Texas watching over her parent's bedand breakfast while they are away. Jonas Mendez is the town's sheriff.The last time Deidre and Jonas saw each other was to say goodbyebefore Deidre left for New York ten years ago.Ten years is a long time. but the attraction that simmered betweenDeidre and Jonas is as strong as ever and the anticipation of whatmight become of it is even stronger!Anticipation is the perfect title for Jonas and Deidre's story.  Ilove how they got back what they once had. Of course this time. it'sbetter than before!  There is a lot of heat and heart in Anticipation;it's a sexy and very romantic story.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
9,"Out of the box you will be impressed with this great multitool! Beautifully polished. individual locking tools that don't clump when you open them. That pliers are not needle nose but I like the compromise. The stout but slightly rounded nose is precise enough for most precision jobs but because the metal is of softer material I can understand why they don't included it. The craftsmanship on this tool is top notch and better than any other multitool I ever had. What more can I say. it's a victorinox!"
5,"I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them."
9,"This is the only soap I use (with occasional excursions into pine tar soap. for specific uses... See my reviews on pine tar soap)I love the peppermint especially for the tingle and zing you get from using it!I use it as bodywash. shampoo. and to do dishes with.I've never experienced the drying effects when others complain of when using it on my hair either.Don't know if it's due to others not using it right or freak body chemistry on my part. Either way. I am a proud Dr. Bronners user!"
12,"In my opinion. this is the greatest Playstation game ever released. The storyline is intense. and profusely in-depth and really grasps you into the storyline. which revolves around many characters instead of one. The music is beautiful and many times envokes emotions during parts of the game. this game . in my opinion. has the greatest musical score. I have noticed people complain about this games graphics. well if you have a problem with graphics in an RPG...then I have to say. your intellectual level is very low. First of all. this game's graphics are fine.even compared to the graphics of more recent video game titles...and the game does Not revolve around its graphics.There are many other factors that seperate this game from other RPGs. This game also has the best story in a video game title to date. and there are situations that occur during the game that add to the story perfectly. If you want a solid. and deep RPG. this is for you."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
8,"This product isn't quite as high quality as it looks in the picture above. and I'd highly recommend you take a close look at its dimensions before purchasing it (if this is a 'medium.' I can't imagine how tiny the 'small' must be).  I'd also only recommend this item for supervised play (not. as I'd hoped. as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy's crate overnight).  The body of the toy is only the length of my index finger. and I'm concerned that any larger breed puppy will rip this thing to shreds in minutes if you let him.  Oh well."
5,"These little patch cables work nicely. there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches. right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches. right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches. whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude. would I recommend these? Yes. if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable. go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else."
8,"My cats loved this. They had energy. their coats looked shiny and had less dander. Compared to Blue Buffalo. this is better and less expensive. But it is still quite pricey so I switched to Purina Friskies which is garbage. because I had to save some money this month. I did some research and the Purina One formula looks pretty good. I would say it is between the Friskies and the Beyond. The first ingredient is real meat. I looked up what 'corn gluten meal' is in the regular Purina One (not Beyond) it is a decent/inexpensive source of protein. It isn't actual gluten at all. it is the second ingredient on the list. I am going to try the Purina One next. And if there are coupons for this one I will get this one. It is really good. I would recommend. especially over Blue Buffalo and Wellness. in my humble opinion."
6,"Avery is a brand that has been doing laser labels for as long as I can remember and they put out a very nice product.  This particular size. the 5260 is the perfect size for address labels for envelopes.  Three columns. ten long means you get 30 labels to a sheet.Easy peel off. easy printing with no jams.  The perfect label.The nice thing about Avery is that it works seamlessly with Microsoft Office.  In word they have templates for all the Avery laser labels and you just have to select which one you are using and the blank template just pops up.  Sometimes with generic brands. this is not the case and you have to manually set your parameters which while doable for a regular MS Word user could prove to be quite an obstacle for the casual user.I highly recommend these labels to anyone.  They will not give you trouble."
3,"What I Loved: Scott was such a delicious guy to read!  He was just the right amount of alpha vs vulnerable.  He was also YUMMY!  The fact that he was blind kind of made him that much more lovable.  Tara and Scott had a great chemistry that was fun to read.Complaint: The ending was way to abrupt!  It felt like a whole chapter was left out of the bookWhat makes this good Holiday read:  If you are looking for a short but naughty holiday read this may work for you.  It was about getting out of a bad situation into a good situation.  Just keep in mind the rather abrupt ending."
3,"I enjoyed the book and the characters I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because I too feel that the author could have backed off a little with all the erotica. The story line is a good one but needs to be developed more. Some reviews were complaining about the link between rider. dragon and sex. If anyone who has read the' Dragonriders of Pern' series would know this has already been established in Dragon fantasy lore. However where as the Pern series down plays the sexual side of the relationships Maiden Flight is in your face erotica. I do agree there needs to be a warning that this is an ADULT dragon fantasy novel  and not for young adults.  The series has great promise and I'm hoping that the next book goes more into the story line with a little sex thrown it ;)"
4,"The late Robert Ginty. R.I.P.. lays down some rough road in this one. though the guy on the cover aint him! This is a NY picture. like Street Trash. Ms. .45. The Wanderers. The Warriors. The Lords Of Flatbush. The taking Of Pelham 1.2.3. (the original 70s version with Walter Matthau. Robert Shaw. and Simon Oakland. not the unneccessary '00s remake!). et al. And like all good made-in-New York movies. you know eventually somebody's gonna be handed their ass!! This is no exception. Be prepared to suffer. You have been warned! The sickness with the quickness!!"
10,"1/8/10 Have been using this drill and am very pleased.  It has tons of torque and the handle comes in handy.  Just great to have a corded drill with this type of power for when the cordless 18V wont do the job or if you have a lot of screws to driveHavent used this drill yet but am looking forward to putting it to work.  I bought it because I only had cordless drills. aside from a great. rugged Milwaukee Hammer drill. was also confident because of great reviews from others. It is very solid and I like the quick change cord.  I expect to have this drill for years"
3,"This is the first book I've read by Ally Blue and it won't be the last. I enjoyed this story immensely even if it was on the light side. There was little to no background or buildup. but somehow it worked as a short story about two very sweet people. I like the heroes this author created. they were good and kind people. even though there were some fights and arguments. they worked things out. I was not a fan of the whole developer and corrupt city officials part of the story but luckily for me. that was only a brief part of the whole story. I enjoyed this very much and would recommend it to others as a hot. romantic MM read."
9,"I bought the blue/heavy resistance band to use in two of my tube workouts. The band I had no longer provided enough resistance and it was time to upgrade.Two things to point out. The handles are not padded. Not a big deal.Secondly. this tube is about 6 inches shorter than what I was previously using. The measurements are in the description. I thought the bands were a standard length so I didn't pay attention to the length. In order to use this band in my workouts. I need to reposition my body/grip/whatever during some of the exercises due to the shorter length.The band is still a nice upgrade from what previously used. Just look at measurements if the band is going to be used as a replacement band."
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
10,"The main flaw with this light would have been trivial in the recent past. Compared to other ways of providing light. even DeWalt ways. this is not an effective solution.I bought this to have a working light that also used the 18v power packs from my various DeWalt 18v tools. So far so good. But it really burns some power. it gets quite warm and the light doesn't last as long and isn't as bright as you would hope.I also have the DeWalt DC527 fluorescent light. it provides a much better working light. lasts longer and is easier to use to get light on your work. By comparison to the DC527 this is an uneven and yellowish light.This is more compact than the DC527 though. and it provides better range. fluorescent provides more white light. but only at limited range."
5,"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard. which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound. drums. congas. tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech. the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best."
10,"Almost bought the variable speed but less powerful cousin.  Glad I didn't.  This unit works great.  It's heavy so you won't want to do much vertical or overhead work.  One reviewr commented that it wears out his workers and I can see why.  An hour is the must I can go without a break. But you can get a lot of sanding done in an hr with this tool.Much quieter than my old Sears unit.  Dust collector works surprisingly well (but I wish they offered a vac attachment becasue at the rate this unit removes material you will have to empty bag every 10 min or sooner.Probably 3 times faster than my 3' Sears and more stable with 4' footprint.My past tools have been Bosch. Milwaukee. and Dewalt.  But I bought Makita's top of line 18V saw and drill and was very impressed.  Bought this based on that experience and great reviews.  Very satisfied."
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
10,"I bought this saw at a woodworking show a couple years ago and have been thrilled with its performance ever since.  I previously owned an inexpensive Black and Decker which had poor balance. a top handle. and tended to vibrate terribly.  I have also used DeWalt and Milwaukee jigsaws. and I still maintain that Bosch is the best.  I happen to prefer the barrel grip.  With this saw I can make super smooth. nearly tear-out free cuts in almost any material as long as I use the proper blade and blade speed.  The sheer lack of vibration alone makes this saw worth its weight in gold when you are trying to make an intricate cut in thin material!!!  I highly recommend this product."
6,"The 3m Copy Holder is useful in a variety of ways. It's good for the student who needs to type up his or her notes from classes. Or the office worker who needs a place to hold papers. The copy holder is 18' wide and is sturdy enough to hold up to 300 sheets of thick paper. catalogs. books. and more. The copy hold fits perfectly on most desks or tables and is designed to be positioned directly between your computer monitor and keyboard. however it will easily fit anywhere. It also has an elastic cord that stretches across to hold your documents in place.  Overall this a very handy office tool and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs it."
2,"Purchased the 3670G via Amazon. Just arrived and immediately plugged it into my Kill-A-Watt. The device shows amperage draw on anything plugged into it and it shows the Mite is only drawing 10amps.Either I received the 10amp model that other reviewers have posted about (old reviews though... two year old reviews) or the mfg is lying about it's capabilities.Having said all that. it's a nice. simple. lightweight machine that really sucks (in a good way). but I can't help but wonder how much better it would perform if it was truly the 12amp model.If any other reviewers have any advice. please post a comment."
9,"The Seal Pup is a great knife to have alongside your pistol. This rode next to my M9 on a Blackhawk Serpa and Omega holster. Held its edge. the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy. The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap. Chunks got torn out of it. The blade finish also wears off. I ended up engraving mine a bit so it didn't look like everyone else's knife. Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally. I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one. Great buy and if you don't have a need for an M9 bayonet. this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments."
12,"I believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because. the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games. Seek out enemy. kill and move to the next level. and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles. so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters. locations. car. weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however. the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning. If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one. I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all. And this one I really do like very much."
3,"I do agree that I would like to have spent more time with these characters. I was very bummed when it just ended. and i do agree it could have used more depth. But I really loved these characters. For what they were. in the length given. they popped. Book reads very much like a brilliant fantasy. Like all her stories so far. the story has a sweet quality to it. but very hot. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was and look forward to more from this author."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
3,"The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling."
4,"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character. although well known by most. is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale."
9,"I was bored and trolling Amazon and saw this...it looked like fun so I ordered it. I read the assembly directions. which said you need 3 people. but a woman said in her review that she assembled her trampoline alone...props to her cause I tried and nothing...absolutely no movement whatsoever. I took it to work and 3 guys assembled it very easily. but used their combined strength to make the pieces go together and open. The smell is obnoxious. which I hope will dissipate over time. All in all a fun purchase."
4,"This film was a bad film based soley on entertainment value.  I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved.  If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality.  this film may have more substance.  Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve.  I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value.  Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining.  Nor does this film have ANY artistic value.  The dialect isn't presented well here either.  The Aramaic voice isn't given justice here.  given the horridly poor interpretation and it's presentation.  This film is trash.  Simply.  God bless."
12,"What can I possibly say about this game that hasn't been said a million times.Perfection.Groundbreaking.Beautiful.Just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Zelda 64.Zelda was my introduction to RPG's and what an introduction it was.The good.Everything.Graphics. story. pacing. etc...Insanely difficult in parts. I still can't beat the water temple without the walk through.And Ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time.The bad?Nothing.One of the games that not only defined the N64 but a game that set the standard for excellence in RPG's.One of the best...ever.Highest recommendations."
7,"It is nicely constructed. It is made of metal. so it will hold up. The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food. You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area. You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds. It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food. If you twist the Weathervane. it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling. It also comes with an attachment (including fasteners) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand. easy to place and remove from stand. Over all this is a nice feeder."
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
2,"OXO Soft-Handled Can Opener. Item # 28081. This is a hard-to-clean kitchen tool. Not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles. Also. the soft handles are not sealed onto the body of the can opener. so dishwater accumulates in them. and therefore so do rotting food particles. mold... you get the point. It is possible to pull off the handles and wash all the surfaces. but what a pain! And then. the handles wear and loosen so they start to slide when opening cans. After three months. I replaced the Oxo Good Grips Can Opener with aZyliss Lock-n-Lift Can Openerwhich. after six months. still works very well."
4,"I loved it-I had seen this movie many years ago and loved it then&#62; I love Richard Burton-He's so deep in this movie-very young and very deep. What a brillant actor he is and became.I gave it five stars because the quality of him overall deserved it.Olvia De Havilland-wow what a brillant star she is. Between the two of them-wow! how different they are-but this movie brought a side we never saw before.Thank you -for the opportunity to share my views."
7,"There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around.  I set them up to water out in the fields around us.  They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose.  As I am driving around my area; I see that I am not the only one who uses them.  They are sturdy. don't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality.  Unlike some other tripods. the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed.  They will fall over if you have a decent windy day.  So. you should check on them occasionally."
5,"I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar. so after some research online and talking to friends. I bought this capo.It goes on easily.comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside. seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!"
3,"Overall. I was absorbed in this story and the semi-abrupt ending has really left me for wanting more.  Don't get me wrong on the ending though.  It was abrupt only in the fact that I wanted to know more and there wasn't any.  I've already checked out Kaye's site and the only other novel listed is Angelic Avenger. which I don't believe is in this series.  I'm 99.9% sure of that one.  So. I'm going to be hoping there's more to this story in the future because I really want to know.  Definitely a great read for anyone looking for something new.For my full review. check out Literary Escapism."
8,"We've been giving our dog this medicine for years and its always done a good job of keeping the ticks and other things off of him.  We have found a few dead ticks in his fur. but never a live one and certainly not one head deep into his blood supply.  Applying it isn't so difficult but since our dog is white. it does leave a discoloration in his fur until his next bath.  This is what our vet recommended so we're going with it and it works fine."
12,"I always hated the WCW. I was playing Warzone. Attitude and WWF titles for a long time. Then I somehow ended up owning this game and I inteneded to dissmiss it. but I found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it. I was happy to hear THQ got the rights to WWF and went from this to Wrestlmania and then the best game on the 64 NO MERCY. However. this is the foundation of where it started and I respect it for that. It brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights. I recomend No Mercy over this. but this original version deserves your respect."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
2,"I just received this yesterday. and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.  I was a little apprehensive. since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet. operated smoothly. and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine. but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also. due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker. we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
4,"I found the first half of the film to be very interesting and well done. Fine acting and production values.  Then it turned into an S&M porno movie.  The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene.  It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
9,"I put this on my Ruger Mark III Target and I am very happy. The multiple reticles would be more fun with larger targets. but at 50 yards. you only need the 3 MOA dot. Easy zeroing and not as heavy as expected. but then again. a Mark III Target is a beast of a .22 pistol. Don't buy the cheesy $20 red dot. Save your dough and buy this quality product. Aimpoints are GREAT. but over rated. If you don't mind the added weight. then this is a better buy."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
2,"I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.  In truth. I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end. it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan. so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall. so while the handle on top makes it portable. and it's built to stand on the floor. it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
7,"I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix. watered. then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall (or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers).Echinacea. red lettuce. romaine lettuce. snap peas. orange sunflower. red sunflower. chives. 4 different heirloom tomatoes. and dill - all of them are growing like weeds.  As soon as they're big enough for transplanting. I'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago. since you can keep the dome mostly shut (or open it up if that's too wet).My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge.  But. that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed doesn't fix.  For the price. I really couldn't be happier!"
8,"This quality spray did exactly as advertised. I have a cat. who likes to go outside his litter box. and an active toddler who loves to drop food and color on our light-colored carpet.  I used this Bissell Pet Stain and Odor spray as directed. generously spraying a stained area. blotting and covering with a wet rag. and leaving it alone for several hours.  I am pleased to say that even some long-time stains that I grown to live with are starting to fade considerably or disappear entirely.As another reviewer pointed out. this product does not work on ink. My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen. and this spray was not very effective on that area. However. as promised. it did eliminate virtually all of my cat stains throughout the house. I have no complaints and would easily recommend this to others."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
7,"I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota. where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover. but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me. this is a minor drawback. but others might find it more objectionable."
2,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant. so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed. but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades. two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit."
10,"talk about getting down to business.  this saw chews up wood.nails.pipe. whatever gets in the way.  it definately outcuts the milwaukee.  i like the weight of this tool. it makes those overhead cuts alot easier. just rest the saw on top and let it chew its way through.i deducted a star for two reasons: 1: there is more vibration than the milwaukee(what else do you compare a saws all to).2: the quick change chuck is a little difficult at times.  it likes to bind up and you will need a plier to twist it free.  not a real tight bind. just too much for fingers.overall. if mine was lost. stolen. or broken. i would not hesitate to purchase the P-C again"
7,"It's a classic all right. but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well. you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag. far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing. however. is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut."
4,"I would have liked to seen more to this movie other than just the beating. I also hate subtitles. I don't care if they were trying to make it accurate to the dialect. I don't like to go to a movie to pay to read. to me it defeats the purpose: i could read a book. Had lots of gore. for that I gave it an extra star. For the repetitive scenes over and over again. I subtracted several stars. You know what kills me. Conservatives and religious people bash violence in movies and video games. but it seems as if it is ok to put this stuff in as long as your talking about Christ. Hypocrisy = religion do as I say not as I do. right? and stay away from those alter boys!"
4,"I really didn't like the way Jesus is portrayed in this film because it shows Him more as being a human being who plays practical jokes on His Apostles and goofing off during His sermons than being the Son of God who came on earth to save us. Call me old fashioned. but I like the traditional way of portraying the life of Jesus in film. which shows Him as being compassionate. loving. and bold in doing His mission. and yes with a sense of humor. but at the same time taking serious things seriously. I have to say that I liked the Jesus of Nazareth film and 'The Passion' by Mel Gibson. much better."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
10,"PC 97366 has so much vibrations that I had to give it gift to my enemy..  Horrible...  then within a week . I got a Xmas Gift of Home Depot Card and I used it to buy Rigit Sander from Home Depot for $139...  ( I SAID . I CAN RETURN IT IF I DON'T LIKE IT )WHAT A SURPIRISE THEN...  THE RIGID IS SUPREME SANDER WITH ZERO PAIN IN HAND AND AWESOME GERMAN BUILT ...  GREAT BUILD QUALITY AND 3 YEAR WARRANTY...  YOU CAN'T MISS THAT...I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD RIGID SANDERS ARE...  BYE PORTER CABLE..."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
8,"Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer.  She sniffed it and walked away.  I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else.  I don't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old. also a big chewer. hasn't touched it either.  I'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me."
8,"We have two lab mixes. The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew. but he was going through too many rawhides. I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section. The first plain bone went over well. So I ordered more on Amazon. I'm so glad I did! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have! Thank goodness for nylabones!"
5,"I've been a gigging musician for almost 20 years. and this is the most well made. most comfortable guitar/bass strap I've ever used.Pros:- Substantial padding where you need it- Perfect stitching- Heavy. stiff leather ends- Soft. fine-woven material - not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps- Underside is lined with an even softer material - makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on- Did I mention it's super comfortable?Cons:- None to speak of.  Seriously.  It's that phenomenal.Perfect whether you're rocking a featherweight Strat or a 16-pound 6-string bass.I use it with a 13-pound 5-string Warwick bass. and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me.  I hardly notice I'm actually wearing it.Combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks. and it could easily last you 10 years.You will not be sorry with this purchase."
12,"I won't lie this game was really cool back in the day and i play it with utter pleasure.(at that time) it was only my second 64 game i ever borrowed. sure the graphics was stink and at times the game play frustrating the heck out of me. however this isn't one i'll call a classic it's no Zelda. Perfect Dark . Donkey Kong 64 and i can go on and on. if you don't believe me try to play this game now!!!! you will find yourself saying yuk! yuk! yuk! 'n' i am being nice. it's worth a try but most likely true gamers will find it bogus. it has not true replay value and all in all it had it's time and that's all it will ever have. in my opinion. for those who loved it i am no psychologist so i can't say whats your problem is but!!! maybe you need to play real good game laterzzzzz folks / gamers."
12,"In its tenure. the N64 had its share of bad games. With exceptions like Super Mario 64. the THQ wrestling games and a few others. it seemed like the bad outweighed the good. But with 'Ocarina of Time'. the balance took a drastic shift as n64 was given its best overall game.'Ocarina of TIme' has many strong points for itself. For one. the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake. The game plays across a vast world with different subsections. each with their own particular themes. The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game. Graphics and sounds are done extremely well. considering the cartridge space allowed.There is not much to complain about. as this game really showed players what the N64 was capable of. It's unfortunate that other game publishers didn't work this hard. But then again. &quot;Ocarina&quot; is a tough act to follow."
4,"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph. the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.Joseph is the favored son of his father. a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery. he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor. and Joseph's steadfastness. he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him. seeking help. they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first. it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well."
5,"The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price. It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young (smaller) player or a.nice travel instrument."
2,"My son works at a ice cream shop. and when I recieved this ice cream scoop. he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work. Until he actually used it. It looks metal. but feels like it's plastic. When I used it for the first time. I was scooping out very hard ice cream. and it felt like it was going to break. I had to turn it in circles to get anything. I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one. At least I know it won't break in my hand."
5,"this is my first petal of  any kind.  I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that.  glad I did.  this Wah petal is so much fun.  you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow.  It is hours and hours of fun.  the sounds are great.  I have had no problem with performance.  it works as it should.  I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well."
8,"I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years.  NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid.  This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years. but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off.  The cord finally snapped on Monday.  Not only the short lifespan considering the price. but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan.  No matter what litter brand I tried. it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan. would stick to the rake. and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws. which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea. very poor longterm performance."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
5,"Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too. but it is very flammable. I would call it average."
2,"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up. my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine. but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal. and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item."
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
7,"This is a nice. versatile pot holder for any sort of railing.  We live in a townhouse. and each unit has a fenced-in. concrete patio.  There's really no place to plant flowers. so a container garden is an only option.  I didn't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio. so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed.  It's 10 inches at the top. and will accommodate a range of flower pots.  The fastener is adjustable. to make them useful in a wide variety of locations.  I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly.  It's sturdy and well-made. and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
9,"Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However. on my two lever-action rifles. it's not very effective -- probably no surprise. given the design. On an older Winchester 94. I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together. with some effort. On a Winchester 9422. it attaches itself to the trigger guard. and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded. cocked. and fired with the lock still in place."
12,"Sephiroth. the main villian of the game. is probably the best-dressed villian in a FF game.  Also. he has the most sinister theme of any villian in any game.  Everything about Sephiroth is sinister.You play Cloud. a man from the small city of Nibelheim (sounds like a city in Germany). Cloud works for AVALANCHE. a terrorist group that's fighting against the evil Shirna. Inc.  As the game unfolds. you learn that Shirna. Inc does far more evil than AVALANCHE does.  Shirna. Inc knows no end to its evil.One of the best games for the ps1!"
10,"I bought this unit some time ago and finally got to use it remodeling our basement. I have a 12inch compound sliding miter saw in my garage but the thought of lugging that thing down stairs to cut base moulding didnt float my boat. Then. I remembered my Bosch 1640SVK. Yes. it has limitations but none that was a deal breaker. I placed a 3/4 sheet of 24x96 plywood on a couple of saw horses and I was trimming and nailing like a Pro. No clouds of saw dust. no dust vacuum running although SVK does have a 2.25 port. I can sight exactly where I want the narrow kerf and it does the job.I will have this fine tool outside when I re-do the screens on our three season porch.Thanks Again Bosch!!!"
7,"I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons. but with the help of another person and two long poles. we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away. it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled. before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing. what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit. but I don't want to kill songbirds. certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away. not kill them."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
12,"the one that started it all i have it and you should to i will in detail say the pros and cons of the game.the pros are great story. great puzzles. the suspense is great as well as the monsters that are in it over all it draws you in the world of the resident evil.the cons to much back and forth in the game. bazooka wont blow open doors. the other issue is if played on the ps2 you have to get used to the original controls again im used to ps2 games now guess im spoiled lol where you use the analog sticks to move and look around.over all great game turn out the lights put it in and put yourself in the game and have fun."
4,"Holy cow!!!  I was completely drenched with sweat at the end of this workout.  I have a few of Kathy's videos and have always been pleased with her technique.  She doesn't disappoint here.  I have all of Billy Blanks  Tae-bo tapes and this so much better.  A very thourough warm-up leads into  a tremendous workout that keeps your pulse elevated and ends with a great  toning section for the legs utilizing the kicks you've just learned.  A  bonus ab work rounds out a perfect tape.  Also feautured is trainer Kelli  Roberts. from Cher's first video and the star of her own two excellent step  video.  Hope someone signs Kelli up for her own kickboxing tape!"
5,"This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank. which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals. decent quality. and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!"
12,"This is the best shoot em up on the N64. I was very impressed with the game play. the graphics. the action. the multi player fun. everything.... the only downfall about the game is I wanted more. more. more. The cheats are great when you unlock them and the best thing is you dont need a memory card. everything saves on the cartridge. RARE actualy managed to compress a game that was too big for the N64 into this game somehow. and it suprises me that it does not even use the N64 Expansion pack to do that!!! This game is not just hoursand hours of fun. but days. weeks. years . i still play this cool game even today!"
7,"It is flexible. can hold 50+ pounds (lbs). and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt. as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force. which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts. one of which can easily handle.  However. the overall look is less than inspiring."
5,"I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on. so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose. and notably. I chose it for the color. just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far. it's given me no problems. and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain. too. since it's certainly not an expensive accessory."
4,"Besides the religious backdrop. the main crux of this movie is to depict as much realism and authenticity as possible about the corporeal punishment during the Roman times. From the religious view point. the movie wants you to feel visually what your Lord has gone through.If you think that the 39 lashes were just mere whips. you are quite misinformed. Read Josh McDowell's book on Crucifixion and  you will get the written version about the instruments used during Jesus' time. Again. the crucifixion itself was shown under full light with no turning away of the camera.In my opinion. the movie has achieved. in stellar proportions. what it had set out to do. The additional depiction of Mary's love for her Son was well constructed. although not documented the way the movie has shown. All in all. the theatrical effects are moving and they are a good reminders for believers.Good work. Mel!"
5,"Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings.  I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way.However. I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine.  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate.  Therefore. strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds.  I also love the d'Addario make.  Which I purchase through Amazon...always."
10,"I purchased this attachment a couple months ago. and it has proven to be a real surprise.  Since it is an inexpensive tool. with the more inexpensive chisels and bits included. I didn't expect it to be a precision tool. but  it really does well.  I have now used it to make mortises in red oak. white  pine. and southern yellow pine. and am glad that I didn't spend more money  than I did.  The other reviewers are absolutely correct that set-up is time  consuming. but for a hobbyist woodworker like me. it does the job  efficiently. cheaply. and well.  I would definitely purchase this item  again."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
5,"Got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me. my guitar. and my sound.I'm a 62 YO newby to guitar!! This proves that easy helps. I have a big baby Taylor and when i needed new strings I went to the wrong place. got Martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me.  Sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. My friend said that he uses D'Addario and that they make ALL the difference in the world!! Tried them and he was right.  I changed my own (on the big Baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the E and B string like the dealer did!) MY Taylor recommends Elixr. but the D'Addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!!"
12,"This game I grew up with and enjoy very much. I have been playing this game since I was 6 or 7 years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new. What I have is a like new version but unforutantely I lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe I will find it one day while I shop around the internet. I love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the like."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
5,"Price:Very reasonable price for what they do.Comfort:These stay on your head very well and are comfortable. I have not noticed ear irritation yet.Noise reduction:These are absolutely stellar at noise reduction. These block so much sound. you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums. They also don't distort out side sound. Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly.Sound quality:Crisp mid and high range. When it comes to the low end. these are lacking. And if you blast your music the low end distorts. But they block sound so well you don't have to blast them.Why not just buy in ear head phones. and over ear muffs?I have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones. It is very annoying. doesn't work very well. and looks pretty dumb too. These head phones are a much better solution."
10,"I must own about 20 DeWALT tools and this is a frustrating tool.  For the most part I really like DeWALT tools but this one needs to be redesigned.  The blade will not track straight.  The problem seems to be in the blade mounting system.  I have never had a problem with the blade coming loose. however as you screw the cap to tighten the blade you can see the plunger start to turn as you crank down on this thing.  Since you tighten to the right. the blade will end up pointed to the right.  Now I have found that if you back off slightly you can line it up. but that's not the way a jig saw should work.  I think that in this case you would be better served with a Bosch."
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
8,"I am really liking this product after all.  I was not sure it would stay warm for long. but it really does.  I have not determined how long yet. but hours more than anything I have ever used.  I put it outside under a blanket in a small house to keep a cat warm. and I think tonight was the first she was on it!  Even if the cat does not like it in the end (I had an electric warmer before and she was afraid and would not go in the house) I am keeping it to warm my bed before I get under the covers!"
5,"Holy guacamole. you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase. then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too."
9,"This is a compact. handy. well made tool.  I debated giving it 4 stars because the handle material seems thin and perhaps a bit fragile. but. so far it holds up great and takes up very little space. all things considered. I also have a few Smith's diamond sharpeners and the DMT beats them all.  The folding design protects the surface when closed and provides a handle when open.  Tip: when using this as a typical bench whetstone. lean the far end of the sharpener on the table top.  Only add water or use it dry - anything else will gum it up.  Although this angles the stone. it steadies it. making for solid grining angle and surface.  I've sharpened a collection of knives and even got a really good edge on some scissors I was debating tossing - fist time sharpening scissors.  Look out edged tools!This is one of those tools I'd buy again to have a back-up.  MADE IN USA."
3,"I have read a few of Karen Erickson's books previously and overall she's a pretty good writer. I enjoyed this book. but it wasn't something I was thinking about much after finishing it. Not a huge amount of depth to the heroine. I had some trouble relating to her with her need for useless spending. but she did have great chemistry with the hero and I liked that there wasn't a huge 'end of the relationship' moment like many romances. rather the characters progressed in their relationship without tons of drama. Overall a good read and I would read this author again. the rest of the series would be worth checking out also."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
8,"Our lab carries around sticks. rocks. you name it wherever she goes. This particular style of Nylabone is exceptional because of the design.  There are two ridges that fit their incisors perfectly so they can carry it around without worrying it will slip out and break my foot if she drops it!~ Also. even though not flavored. she likes to work on it slowly. which means for the money it will last a long time.  We've spent a lot on the other types of designs and she liked them but they were either to destructible or too heavy for her to walk around with for any amount of time.  For whatever reason. it seems to calm her to carry a bone around and this is the best designed. tough and perfect size for a large dog. She says THANK YOU:)"
10,"I earn an income visiting construction sites.  More rough carpenters use this circular saw then any other (including the Skil HD77M).In March of this year. I bought the HD77 used ...to replace a low-end Black & Decker which was purchased new for $50 in 1981.For DIY projects around the house. the heavy-duty. smooth operating HD77 has yet to disappoint.  Initially. I had to get used to the weight and the ergonomics.  The cuts were smooth with no irritating startup kickback.  Plywood and sonotubes; no problem.With the increasingly harsh Toronto area winters. the oil in the HD77 requires to be room temperature warm prior to using the saw in the great outdoors of ours.With proper maintenance and care. this saw will be a vital and permanent tool for rough carpentry."
4,"Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen. Pretty much that is what this movie is. 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured. Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line. this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here. nope just two hours of beatings and torture."
10,"Ordered the 120 to check it out first. since I have never used Mirka before. I'm also confused on so many positive reviews. I found the discs cut really well and smooth out of the gate. but do not last long at all. Freud lasts longer for me. just hate the universal hole pattern they have. I'm pretty much using one disc per rail and stile of a cabinet door. That's not much life. Maybe it holds up better with a heavier grit prior to 120? My planer leaves wood fairly smooth. I'm used to going 120 from the planer. on up in grits. Oh well. On the search again."
2,"They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep. that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less. takes up less room in my cupboard. and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!"
3,"I love romances that are 'real' and this one is so very real. The characters are not larger than life. they have pasts. things they regret and dreams they have forgotten. They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other. their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book. it was beautiful. sweet. sad in places and oh ever touching. watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life."
3,"Rating 4 1/2 starsI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated in any way.Brett Andrews has an apartment above his club.  And Lisa is waiting for him.  This is a great way to start off this story.  Leo is an old friend of Lisa&#8217;s that&#8217;s come to the club.  The ending will leave you wanting to read more about this trio and having more of the club experience.Kallysten feeds on her reader&#8217;s need for a sexy vampire &#8211; especially for those of us that are female.  She paints a great picture of what happens when new meets old.  There&#8217;s nothing dark or sinister about what this group has.  If you&#8217;ve never read this author before. why not try this series.  If you love sexy. erotic. vampire short stories you can&#8217;t go wrong by reading Kallysten.  She&#8217;s a great author that knows how to pack a lot in just a few pages.  She never disappoints her readers."
8,"I've tried some of the major competing brands in an effort to save a few bucks. but Frontline continues to provide the best results for fighting fleas (on my three beagles and two cats).Last year. Frontline helped eliminate a flea infestation on my cats. when used in conjunction with other flea control solutions throughout my house. This year. we adopted three beagle puppies that were covered with fleas when we got them. Used Frontline again. at the recommendation of our vet. and the fleas were wiped out before they had a chance to re-infest our home.Continuing to use Frontline now to maintain our &#34;flealessness&#34;. I don't think Frontline Plus is perfect (It's expensive and doesn't seem to always last a full month). but for my pets. it's the best available and none of them display any adverse reactions to it."
4,"A tape or DVD of this show should be owned by every family in America. The level of care and loving craftsmanship seen here is something we are likely never to see again in the production of a film or show for children.This is demonstrated most of all. of course. in the music.'Silver and Gold'. 'Holly Jolly Christmas'. 'We Are Santa's Elves'.'There's Always Tomorrow'. 'The Most Wonderful Day of the Year'(whose eyes can stay dry through that one?) - all original compositions with full orchestral and choral accompaniment for a single TV show!For generations now. 'it isn't Christmastime until 'Rudolph' comes on'. Even if the networks give up airing it. I know my family will be cueing up this video every year the calendar's page is turned to December - I hope your family will be too."
12,"Lunar silver star story complete is the best remake ever! Blows away the original in every possible aspect. from graphics to story.+ one of the best 2d graphics ever. everything is crisp and detailed with great anime sequence+ new soundtrack is great. the only song boat blow me away+one of the best cast of characters ever+ a great story reworked. a great improvment over the original+ no random battle+ the battle are pretty difficult ( specially the boss battle)+ voice acting is good+ new extras+ great package- the gamplay is on the simple side- again a little sidequestsnow. my classification of the first lunar versions.lunar silver star story complete (ps) 10/10 masterpiece !lunar silver star harmony (psp) 8/10 downgraded version of the playstation masterpiecelunar the silver star (sega cd) 7/10 good.. but very obsolete. overshadowed by silver star storylunar legend (gba) 0/10 pure garbage"
4,"I am not a 'religious' person. however. I felt it was important to see this movie.  If nothing else. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.After sitting through a very quiet showing. my wife and I got up and walked out without saying a word.  It took a while for the movie to sink in.  Nobody was talking as they left the theatre.It was a moving experience.  Graphic and disturbing.  Something I am glad that I sat through. but can't see adding this to my movie collection.More interesting than the movie itself. is the reaction of those who liked or disliked it.  Reading the reviews of this movie is a great way to see the cultural divide in our country."
12,"This pretty good. it has a good story. great in-game movies and adequate gameplay. However most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to Red Alert. This is simply not true. The two games have  almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game. In saying this  I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay  from Red Alert. Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring  helicopters and cheap &quot;hover units&quot;.However this game is  not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics.  featuring performances by several Hollywood stars (well maybe not stars but  close enough). The graphics are pretty good but other games have done  better.Sure it's a classic and if you really like the series go  ahead and buy it. But if you want the true best strategy game of 1999. go  and check out Homeworld it's a far better game."
9,"It is an OK lantern that provides light at night. I did not try it out using unleaded gasoline. so I am going to assume it works OK using it (We used Coleman Fuel for it.) It is not too heavy to carry around. although it is way too heavy to hang on their very own Coleman Packaway Deluxe Camp Kitchen as the pole sways way too much. It was easy to setup and the included mantles worked great.The big issue on the one I received was that the adjustment knob was too sensitive to adjust the intensity to anything other than Off. Low. or High. There was no way to adjust it anywhere in between."
8,"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However. since Purina developed the smart-blend. she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes. change isn't better."
8,"These are a great price. and my dogs can't get enough of them!  I give them as gifts occasionally to friends with dogs. and they find their dogs love them as well.  I highly recommend.  I have two German Shepherd mixes (one with jaws of steel I think) and they stand up to the test.  Eventually they are worn down to nothing. but that usually takes 2 or 3 months. even with my more active chewer.Warning though. you don't want to step on these in the middle of the night!"
4,"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona. but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued. not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved. and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies."
7,"This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
4,"This is not a DVD. this is a world-wide experience. Everytime I watch this DVD. I realize exactly what Jesus did to save me and.as painful and hard as it is to watch. I love HIM even more. It's not for the faint of heart. it's not the traditional family movie. It is however a very essential DVD to receive as your own personal copy because it teaches you things through words and actions no other movie can teach you. I hope all who gets it appreciated all the effort taken to keeping it authentic in language. events and the message being told. Contrary to what happened to the director. this is his finest work. A masterpiece and a classic."
2,"Heavy. smooth action. sharp.  My husband makes an ultra-deep-dish 'priazzo' about 2 inches deep. and this cuts right through - extra pepperoni. extra veggies. extra cheese. extra thick crust. it can handle it all!  Plus. it feels good in your hand.  Nice piece of equipment.Update 7/3/12: I suddenly realized a couple of weeks ago that this wheel wasn't working as well as it used to. so I decided to sharpen it for the first time. It was a little tricky to run through my Chef's Mate. but it's working a little better now. I'm thinking I'll need to replace it in a year or so. Still. it was used about once a week for about 4.5 years; if I get another year out of it. that's not too shabby!"
10,"I just used this kit for the first time. I was gluing some melamine sheets with Roo Glue (specially made for melamine) The set up time was 15 minutes. so I had a lot of surface area to cover in short order. This glue kit. using the glue roller did a nice job. It enabled me to cover a lot of surface area quickly. The amount of glue that is released is based on how much you squeeze the container. You can easily see the flow. so guesstimating is pretty easy.My only dilemma is when doing biscuits and glue edge joinery; it is necessary to switch heads. When you are dealing with glue that is sure to get messy. So my quest is to find a dedicated biscuit joining glue bottle. That way I can use both at the same time without making head changes.I think this kit is a great idea. It might be all plastic. but is ideally suited for the purpose. Highly recommended."
8,"We use Frontline Plus for flea control because it works. We started with Advantage when our Golden was younger. and that worked well. too... but our dog likes to swim and Frontline is waterproof so we switched. She is 8 yrs old now and has never had a flea - which is amazing since we live in S.CA. near the beach where fleas abound and visit parks all the time. You are supposed to put on monthly... I end up putting on every other month and in winter every 2-3 months... seems to work fine with those intervals. Frontline isn't cheap - but Amazon has best price... Our Costco started carrying it for the same price. but no tax and free shipping gave Amazon the edge."
8,"This product is a great buy for the money.  I shopped around a lot and couldn't find anything to compare.  This is the second one I bought.  I've had the first one almost a year and it's still working.  It is pretty quiet and the timer works well.  My cats don't try to break into it like others seem to do.  It won't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep (since it's just water in plastic) but works well for a weekend away.  It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too!"
9,"The 6 piece set was more than I actuallly needed. but I didn't know where I was going to mount the speed bag and so I got the whole kit.  The speed bag is really good quality and the swivel is better than I thought it was going to be.  It is nice to have both the wrap and the gloves if you are a beginner because you may find that one suits you better than the other.  I did not end up using the platform but the frame leads me to believe that it is very sturdy.  The jump rope. ah. the jump rope is a nice touch and it is nice to have. but i's nothing special.If you are looking for a fun and challenging arm workout the speed bag is a lot of fun to learn. It is not about punching something as hard as you can it is about controlling your punch.  I like it. it's fun and it's a really good outlet on very bad days."
9,"Awesome Sharp knife. Had the old version for about 10 years and never needed to sharpen. It was not the skeleton like this but they do not make the non-skeleton version anymore of this. My old Gerber disappeared one day and I was sick about it. had a lot of memories tied to that knife. LOL...So decided to get this updated version of the model called the e-z out skeleton that they are selling now. SHARP. HOLDS an Edge and just kicks bottom. Took about a week to get use to flipping the blade out with one hand and thumb but now have that mastered.Love this knife so much keep it beside the bed at night and it is the first thing I look for when getting dressed in the morning."
2,"I've always loved cake decorating. ever since I took my first Wilton class.  Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but. I admit. a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps. my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book. as all Wilton Lesson Plans. it's great."
4,"I've had this tape for a little over a year. and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently. this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!"
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
3,"I have always had dogs and read dog books.  Recently got a kitten - turned big-boy cat and thought I might enjoy this book.  It was extremely difficult to read.  Almost caused me to have a panic attack.  If these things really go on out there - I guess I have been living under a rock.  A colleague was going to get it for his 9 year old daughter and I said NO  Not a book for kids to read.  I am hugging my big boy cat as I write this.  I will be on the lookout for any other Sisypuss vagabond cats out there from now on.AS BOB BARKER WOULD SAY:  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PET (and anyone else's you can afford to)."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
12,"Doom for PS1 is a great game. Almost every level from Ultimate Doom & Doom II is here. plus some new levels never before seen on the PC. This game is dark. scary as hell. and can really get in your head. The soundtrack is totally different from the PC. and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do. The controls are easy to learn. that's a good thing. However. the only reason why I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the graphics. Yes. as you may have already read. the graphics are a bit sluggish. especially when compared to the PC version. In my opinion. the best version of Doom is the PC version. period. Doom. Doom 2. and Final Doom are the best video games ever. in MY opinion."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"This has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the Nintendo 64. This kind of game is great for all ages. I'm 18 years old and my friends and I still. to this day. continue to play Mario kart. It is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours. You can play it by yourself. but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others. There is really no story line to the game. just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with. If you get bored of racing over and over again. there are several mini games. known as battle games. to choose from. Honestly. I like playing the battle games more than I like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family! So. overall I would definitely say get this game if you don't have it! It is a must buy for avid Nintendo 64 users!"
12,"Yes I said ONE of the best games ever made ...but not THE best. This game falls right behind... XENOGEARS. You probably havent played it since its very hard to get. But it's definently. in my opinnion the best game ever ...and if u have the chance then get it!!Anyways. FF7 has great graphics but the character models are totally ugly. The backrounds are very nice though. and so are the FMV'sThe gameplay is fun and addicting except ...THE BATTLE SYSTEM. Why is it that every Final Fantasy game has had a completely boring battle system. Why can't they make them like Xenogears??? Xenogears had a very very great and fun battle system. With battles like this in FF7. you'll always be wishing not to run into a enemy.The sound is perfectThe controls are easyThis game is great. period. And if you havent bought it yet then you are insane.Besides Xenogears. no game comes close to this"
9,"4 month update!well after about 4 month it has completely lost it's sharpening ability. minding that i do a lot of cutting. and I used this on every knife around the house. However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer. all an all i'm going to switch to sharpening stones.My Initial review:Sharpens the knives like never before! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it). rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade. works very well on a variety of steel grades."
3,"This is a greatest-hits grab bag of 25 stories from the Grimm's Fairy Tales collection. unillustrated. and apparently taken from the 1884 Margaret Hunt translation.

8,"It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not. My friend's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them. He has this one still after several months. The head is gone. but the rest is intact. My boyfriend's dog. however. only picks it up when she knows I'm waiting for her to play with it. My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around. if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp."
9,"I have a quite a few knives in my collection. ranging from spyderco's. benchmade. cold steel. ka bar to name a few. and this sharpener puts an extremely sharp and fine edge on all of them. It even makes cheap Chinese made knives hair shaving sharp. The DMT is by far the best and most simple to use sharpening stone I have ever come by. basically no skill is required to sharpen a knife with it. And hey it's made in the USA right in Massachusetts so u get good American quality. Don't think about it. just buy it!!"
12,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 - Circa 1999GOOD:- Good Balanced 2D fighter. considered a classic to many hardcore 2D fighting fans- Lots of modes to unlock and lots of fighters to choose fromBAD:- Loading times. very short but still there- Graphics might be dated for some peopleWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- Not over the top like Guilty Gear X/X2. Marvel Vs Capcom. or Capcom Vs SNK- Old School type game play and not combo heavyGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- King of fighters 2000 and up- Fatal Fury: Mark of WolvesADDITIONAL NOTES:- Last game in the Street Fighter 'Alpha' franchise (as of 1999)- Has all fighters from Street Fighters Alpha 1 and 2 as well as a few from the old time Street Fighter's like Street Fighter II: The world Tour- Street Fighter Alpha is called Street Fighter Zero in Japan- Practicality same game on Sega Dreamcast"
5,"A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there. but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal."
8,"First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty. but I still loved them. The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone. Now it is shaped a little weird. but I like it none the less. Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone. It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food... I just close my eyes and pretend.Conclusion: Great chew bone! Lasts a very long time. Not sure what could be improved."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
9,"I had one for my XD and now have a few more items I wish to keep SAFE from others using.  Not only a great price they are awesome to use and easy to change the codes for locking/unlocking.  I had lost the directions form my years ago one and nor have the easy instructions to change the codes.  Insert a pin into the opening and change the codes. how easier can it be. I could of had a V8 moment when I saw this....Silly me for forgetting..."
2,"I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.  This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First. I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next. I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial. yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last. this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one. but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again."
9,"After becoming pregnant. I've tried to carry water with my everywhere and not in a plastic container (due to chemicals. BPA. etc.) This sig coated aluminum works great - it doesn't have a taste and it cleans very easily with a bottle brush. and the lid with the hole is very very handy for toting around on my finger or carrying with one hand.I've actually dropped it several times so it has a few dents now. but I am glad I went with these instead of a glass bottle. which is also supposed to be very good to drink out of. but that would definitely have shattered by now. The little dents don't bother me and the outside color/finish is still fine. I prefer this size to the larger SIG sizes as it is not too heavy to carry around in my purse. and this has never once leaked on me. It keeps water nice and cold for a short time too."
7,"I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better."
8,"When frontline first came out it was strong enough that 1 dose would last on one of my dogs for over two months. it's not that strong anymore it seems.  It does however. work really well.  I want to use it specifically because it kills fleas as eggs and adults.  It will help with ticks but they are very hard to get rid of.  I get this size pkg and divide it up between my 8 dogs who range in size from 22lbs to 90 lbs. My vet gave me a syringe to get the liquid out of each of the vials and advised me on the correct dose for each dog.  It really saves money!"
12,"Super Mario 64(1997) When I first got Nintendo 64.it came with Super Mario 64.When the system was hooked up.I put in the game.and was amazed on how the graphics were!It was excellent.The graphics were great.the music was cool.and Mario never looked better!This game is for everyone.I thought Banjo-Kazooie was a great game.but move over Banjo.Mario is back!The best game ever.Features new worlds.characters.setting.and don't worry some of the old villians from the early Mario games are here.and can't forget Bowser and Princess Toadstool(Peach).Better than any 64 game ever made!"
12,"Ocarina Of Time is definitely the best game on the Nintendo 64.Super Mario 64.Perfect Dark and F Zero X are awesome but Ocarina Of Time is the best out of any other game on the system.What else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at Role Playing games forever?The graphics are awesome(some Game Cube games dont look this good) the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellent.Whereas the difficulty in Super Mario 64 stayed pretty much the same throughout the game Ocarina Of Time gets harder when you get to be a better player.Also you get an extra heart after beating bosses because youll need it.Its very challenging I still havent beaten it and am not sure if I ever will.Easy games can be a lot of fun but they just arent as substantial as a game like this.The challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls. Its just a great game and is a must for any Zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging games."
4,"The cast of Stomp is a great addition to this DVD.  My daughter fell in love with it the first time we watched it and asks for it repeatedly.  More importantly. it is not overly annoying to adults.How I rated this DVD:* Educational value.  Since buying this DVD my daughter has become very interested in making her own music.  I have found her stomping. making drums from rubbermade containers. and trying to blow in bottles.  She is only 20 months old and I think this is very impressive since we have only had the tape a few weeks.* Entertaining to child.  Keeps her entertained through the whole video.* Entertaining to adults.  I can even watch the tape with her and not become mindlessly numb.* The DVD starts right at the menu.  No annoying commercials to sit through.* Cost.  The video did not break the budget.  It was reasonably priced."
10,"If you are using this saw without clamps to hold what you are cutting. STOP RIGHT NOW if you value your fingers.Get one of two of these clamps! They are simple. well made and make your saw much safer. They can be mounted to the saw in a second. and can quickly and securely hold what you are working on. They have a quick release button and a micrometer type fine adjustment for tension. They swing out of the way easily when you don't need them. The rubber foot to hold the work piece is nice and big.Expensive? You Bet!  Overpriced? Absolutely! But then again. you have to ask yourself how much your fingers are worth to you!"
2,"Get the Presto. They're all the same. It's a simple design. a pot and lid. I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy. but when it comes to pressure cookers. it's not like other cookware where you 'get what you pay for.'  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers. Get the Presto."
9,"This knife is perfect for on your keychain carry. I went to a bbq this weekend and it was used multiple times for three different things. I had to pull it off my keychain because everyone needed a bottle opener for there beer. The scissors were used to open a capri sun that the straw was lost for a kid. And the knife was used to open a present. And when I told people it also has a pen they were shocked! awsome little knife just get it and put it on your keychain."
4,"I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out. with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs. with its jabs. too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love. I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!What's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen. that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!"
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of 'A Christmas Carol.'Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade. a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.His visit by the spirits. the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him. leads to a very sentimental ending.It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
12,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE GAMES. I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO PLAY !!IT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE . NOT TO MENTION LOADS OF FUN TOO !! THERE ARE ONLY A FEW HARD BOSSES . BUT WORTH THE PLAYING TIME . ONE TIP . ALWAYS STOCK UP ON AMMO . AND USE THE FOUNTAIN OF REJUVINATION ALWAYS .THROW YOUR DRUMSTICKS AT ENEMIES FOR HEALTH PICKUPS; BUT YOU GET THEM LATER IN THE GAME.  USE YOUR CROSSBOWS FOR BOSSES -AND PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BOOKS SCATTERED THRU THE LEVELS .THEY GIVE YOU CLUES.ALL IN ALL IF YOU YOU WANT TONS OF FUN . THEN GET THIS GAME! YOU 'LL CERTAINLY PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN !!"
5,"This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range. although it only does one effect at a time. so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock. which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds. excluding the heavier metal sounds. this pedal will definitely get you there."
7,"I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this . but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!"
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
4,"That is right. God bless Mel for making one of the most loved and profound depiction of Jesus' crucifixion.Let's face it. there were people in this country who've had it in for Mel sice production on this film began years back. When the worst they predicted failed to materialize they looked like the alarmist fools they are. Mel's tirades just gave them any excuse they needed to attack him all over again.Where is the condemnation for Gary Busey and Billy Zane for starring in an outright antisemitic movie depicting Jewish doctors as ghouls lusting for the body organs of Arabs?Where was the outrage for Marlon Brando when he called Jews 'kikes' right on the Larry King Show?Or what about Russell Crowe who not only once referred to the Maoris of New Zealand as 'niggers' but hit somebody with a telephone?Mel did a really stupid. horrible thing with what he said.But you know what? Suck it up. Accept the asology and let the man get on with his life and the great flicks he makes."
9,"The DMT family of knife sharpening products are top shelf kit.  I use them in the kitchen and in the garage. from sharpening a shovel (yes. it really works better when the edge is sharp) to sharpening steak knives.  These were purchased to add to my truck tool box. small. easy to stow away.  They work very well. just remember to let the sharpening edge do the work for you. do NOT press down hard. you will just remove the diamond media and ruin the surface."
5,"Even though the title says 'Acoustic Guitar Case'. it's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins. I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo. and the reviews were good. Sure enough. the lining is soft and well-padded. The hardware works as it should. and the build quality is almost perfect. However. when closing the case. a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place. then everything is as it should be. The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly. and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. It serves its purpose well. at a reasonable price."
12,"This is a more than ok game.Not the best.but good.If you like the &quot;Spyro&quot; series.you'll like this for sure.The gameplay. control.sound.etc. are all like the first 2.The only problem is it's EASY.Really.really easy.The levels are about 5 minutes long each.and the total gameplay span is about 7 hours.But still. thats better than it being hard.It's still pretty fun and stays true to the first 2.And Crash's little sister premires in it. Here's the review:Graphics:4/5Sound:5/5Music:3/5Fun:4/5Control:D-pad:3/5Analog:5/5Overall:4/5hould you buy it?:Yep"
2,"These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall. and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust. the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows. because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted. because they have a 'lip' at the bottom. that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window. to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place. so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene. for instance!)  Even so. the fan is easily removed. once the screws are in place."
2,"I've long been a fan of OXO utensils but I didn't think there was a good are bad when it came to peelers. I was wrong. I cook quite a bit and had used a peeler recently at my brother's house. When I got this one and used it. it was like night and day. It is surprisingly effective in peeling as if it were super sharp. but I've run it into my hand on accident a couple times and never been cut. There's something about the design of the blade that makes it pretty safe to use and still really quick at peeling. It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer. Nice little feature."
7,"When I originally set this up on our front porch railing. I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it. that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone. it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item. but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me."
3,"My Thoughts - 5 out of 5 unicorns - I loved it!!!**Gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewOkay first things. this is a very adult erotic short story.  It is only about 25 pages. and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some M/M/F.The cover is okay and shows the characters. but it doesn&#8217;t grab my attention.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to judge this book by its cover.Okay I loved this story. but if you aren&#8217;t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don&#8217;t read this story.  It is a quick read. but it totally had my attention.  You get glimpses into the lives of the 3 characters in this book and some background.  I&#8217;m not usually one for short stories. but Kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.I totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves Kally&#8217;s work.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more of this series in the future."
3,"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan. there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that. her best writing. in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total. the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series. you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.  Enjoy!"

7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
5,"Always buy D'Addario strings for my 7 guitars.  Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types.  They have a great rating from other musicians. ....and the price is very affordable.  Highly recommended by this writer.  It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food. musicians. movies....etc.  We all have our likes and dislikes.....For my taste D'Addario EJ16-3D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings.  I like their full sound and their lasting tones."
2,"I searched for an exhaust fan for our new. hot garage.  I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you!  This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months!  Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal; you don't have to touch it except to turn it off and on.  It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.  Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.  With all my searching. Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.  What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?"
8,"On June 15 I adopted a 2yr old jack-a-poo which was rescue from a puppy mill. Every time he ate he would make strange sounds. He would also throw up a lot. The foster mom had him eating wellness brand. I had him for 2 months and really had no idea what to do.I switch him over to Purina Pro Plan Sensitive skin and Stomach just to see if that would help. I am surprise at  the result. It is like having a new dog. He no long makes sounds or throw up. If he drinks water to fast he coughs but. other then that this food has fixed his issues.I highly recommend this if your dog has issues eating they may just need a different diet."
4,"The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray]This film (and particularly the extra disk) is very useful for those particular individuals of the Christian faith who were not given the opportunity to learn about the finer aspects of Christ's Passion. specifically the Stations of the Cross.  Having grown up in the Baptist Church. I was not taught about the Stations. but strict emphasis was given to why Christ gave himself for us.  Additionally. the second disk amplifies the finer aspects of crucifixion. shows where the Stations of the Cross supposedly were in Jerusalem. and Christ's suffering as depicted in the Arts.  It is for these reasons that I recommend this disk set.  Whether or not one accepts Mel Gibson's interpretation of the Passion of Christ is up to the individual and how/what he/she believes."
9,"Dr. Bronner's products are very very good.  I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower.  A little goes a long way.  The main thing is that it really does work!  It will really clear up what ails ya!  I use it as a shampoo too!  My scalp has never felt better.  Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount.  If a soap product such as this suds up heavily... then it probably isn't good for you at all...  This one will suds up a little... and it cleans very very well.  If you have dry skin. ring worm or fungus type skin issues. this will really help it.  Meanwhile. using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay."
8,"I have a miniature dachshund that is addicted to table food. Normaly I leave dry food available at all times and 1 bowl of wet food a day. He has always been a picky eater. basically just wanted human food. Recently he would take a bite or 2 of his dry food and barely touch his wet. So we decided to switch dog food. and ended up choosing this. He LOVES this stuff. I can't leave dry down anymore because he gobbles it up before it hits bowl! Also we buy the containers on Beneful wet food. he loves that as well!Another thing that I love about this food is it makes his coat shiny and soft. Not sure how but ever since he started eating this he has had softer and shinier coat."
2,"when given the choice. i always buy oxo. it's the most comfortable for my hands. this pizza wheel is great. sharp. and cuts clean. and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $3.99!!!!!! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price? uh. no. even if i didn't find it at $3.99. i would have bought it at bed. bath. and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons. amazon. if you want to stay competitive. price your items lower!"
10,"Bosch is the standard by which all other jig saw makers judge themselves. This in itself pretty much says it all. Once you use this tool. you will understand what that means.I prefer the barrel grip b/c it is easier for me to control. However. the handle model has all the same features. just a different grip configuration. so the choice is purely a personal one.This saw cuts through almost anything like butter. There is very little vibration. These features pair up to make your control over the tool excellent. and that is what you get a jig saw for!Changing blades is quick and easy. Changing the base angle is a snap.If you are looking for a jig saw you are going to have for a long time. then this is the tool to get."
8,"Purchased this Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow a couple of weeks ago. It makes a soft running water noise. pleasant to hear. My cat immediately started drinking from it. as she loves running water. Keeps water fresh and clean for her. easy to reload - just unhook the cord from the plug and take to sink. Makes a loud noise when there is debris in it (bugs. food. whatever) to let you know it must be cleaned out! so much easier than refilling the water dish all the time..."
10,"After about ten years of use I have nothing but praise for the 505. Certainly does what it's designed for and continues without fail. Honestly a tool that's a pleasure for me to use in that it has a good feel and balance to itRecently replaced the cord and found the Delta/Porter Cable (SeviceNet)online parts system easy to navigate and with very reasonable prices for parts and shipping. I suppose the lack of dust collection can be a minus but for me personally I don't use dust collection except for table saw. although I do wear a mask when sanding. Excellent tool with exceptional durability."
9,"Love this product. it always works as advertised. I bought a 32oz bottle on October 31st. it is now December 31st and I have used maybe half an inch of this soap. The upfront cost is expensive. but this stuff is very cost effective since a 32oz bottle will probably last me 1.5-2 years. I bought a 4oz one for travel (they didn't have the smaller one in stock) and I imagine it will work for many years to come. One problem is that I dropped my 32oz bottle while in the shower and it broke the top part of the cap off."
10,"After reading the reviews here on Amazon and with the great pricing on the DW788. I took the plunge and ordered both the saw and the stand.I've used several scroll saws over the past 40 years. I can say this is by far the best I've ever used!There is no vibration to this saw and the cuts are easy and flowing. and did I mention how quiet it is?If you're looking for a solid scroll saw. pay a little extra and get a solid machine. you won't be disappointed in the DW788.  Better get a dolly when it arrives. very heavy. solid product  A++"
3,"I have become a big fan of this e-magazine. along with the Hitchcock. Asimov and Analog mags. You can't ask for better escapism on your Kindle. My long que of books to read are gathering dust due to my new fondness for short fiction stories. Can't go wrong for the price if you enjoy reading. My only gripe is not being able to view the cover in color on my Kindle. Guess I'll need to buy the new Kindle Fire for that. If you like mysteries. detective stories. etc.. you'll enjoy EQMM. If nothing else. try the 14 day free trial and find out for yourself."
8,"My cats love this food...and the price is right.( usually a bit cheaper than any store) If you'll read the ingredients. the FIRST ingredient is not chicken meal or some by product. it's real chicken!! The cats love it. and it's very nutritious. We took this bag to our Veterinarian and showed him what our cats were eating...he was pleased and said go ahead and feed them this..and he had tons of food in his office he could've tried to sell us for our one cat's sensitive tummy.  He said this food is great!!  We won't feed them anything else!"
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
4,"Olivia de Havilland is at her best in My Cousin Rachel. I happened to catch this movie on TV and had never heard of it. I searched for it and found it and just had to ad it to my collection. Rachel is Manipulative. Deceptive and Conniving or isn't she? A black widow Spider. she mates and she kills or does she? This movie had me pulled into the story because you love Rachel and yet you hate Rachel. Olivia was a powerhouse and all the reason to see this movie. If you are a fan of Olivias then take a chance. this one will become a favorite for you as it did for me."
7,"This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!"
2,"Excellent durability.  Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now. you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall. very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split. so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes. the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still. it's a decent box that continues to function okay."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
8,"Our Apollo can't live without his Teddy! I've never had a dog so attached to his toy. He mangles it.runs with it and sleeps with it. Absolutely in love with it. It has held up better than any of his other toys...I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy. I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails. This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb. black Lab punishment...now that is a true test!!"
2,"I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products.  The meat tenderizer is another good product.  It is very ergonomic. and it's heavy/solid so that you don't have to pound as hard as you would with more lightweight tenderizers.I don't like the fact that you can't put it in the dishwasher. but really. scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you're all set.  After shopping at several home product stores in search of a tenderizer. I came back to the OXO Good Grips because I found it the best. in spite of not being able to put it in the dishwasher."
5,"These D'Addario  strings are great!  I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using. these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life.  Intonation is good and I've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat. even more so than my Sheraton.  Being from the 'old school' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper. but what can ya do? Besides that. I am totally stoked and happy with these.  I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good."
5,"...but for a small woman with small hands. it's difficult to operate.  It also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings. which can't be good for them.  I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock. a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both. if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.  When playing at home I'll use the more gentle Schubb."
8,"Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I've found. They are much sturdier (you won't stick your hand through) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up. These are pretty good sized. so it's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds.The packaging is well designed too. The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel. Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them. A++ product. If you have dogs. you really should try these baggies!"
9,"This must be more ideal for a handgun.  The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15. Remington 12 gauge. nor my Reuger .22.  The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger. however. when I tried that. I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun.  The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved.  I should have returned it. but I was lazy."
12,"Such a necessity that once I received it for Christmas I got rid of the Jumper Pak for good.The Expansion pak holds MUCH more memory.If you have games that need it ask mom and dad night and day to buy you an Expansion Pak.You really have no need for the Jumper Pak.The Jumper Pak is really hard to get out anyway.I had to use a knife to get the Jumper Pak out which cant be too good for the system but what the hey now the Expansion Pak is in and I dont need to worry anymore."
7,"Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1."
7,"I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof. EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging. no squirrels. great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price. I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
2,"Searched high and low for the perfect tongs for non-stick surfaces that didn't cost a fortune and of course found the OXO brand to perfectly fit the bill (as usual).  These are not too long. perfect for kitchen use.  Their tips are not the annoying soft silicone type like so many out there but instead a harder tip that is angled and pointed so you can use then for a number of surfaces or into pots of boiling things.  I really love the feel of these in my smallish hands and that they lock is an added bonus so they don't take up tons of room in your drawer.  Perfect!"
8,"I erroneously assumed that I'd get what was shown in all the photos - a T-Rex.  The listing title says &#34;dinosaur varies&#34; and the listing points include &#8226;Available in Brontosaurus. Stegosaurus and T-Rex.  There wasn't an option for me to choose. and I wish it had been clearer to me that the packers would chose what toy I was sent; I would have purchased this from a different shop.Instead of a T-Rex. I got a brontosaurus with a long thin neck that looks like it would be easy to chew off.  My dog doesn't care what dino he got. But the Rex shape looks a lot more durable."
7,"I love Perky-Pet feeders. but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything. especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil. and 1 part white sugar. let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this. you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes. and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar. and small insects."
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
12,"This game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo. They have other games. they rent other games. but they keep coming back to this one.They like the two player option. They like the challenge  (they're not teens yet). They like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games. They like being able to set their and the opponent's  skill levels. They just love this game!I personally wish it were a  little less violent. but compared to other games out there. this is a  teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of. buy this  game."
7,"This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill. so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it. I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead. I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer. but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building). and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box. you probably have a defective battery."
12,"I loved the game the first time i played it through. but as with MOST (not all) games. it got boring the second time around...:(...It strays far from the movie. It has the basic characters. but is not like the movie. You will recognize a few items and place from the movie...like the palace. of the last part of the game. where you defeat Darth Maul. but it was just kind of a game to sell and make money...It's fun. but doesn't lastJason Anderson"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
7,"I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet. but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further. but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly. and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now. i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
4,"We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now!HOWEVER. I do have just one small complaint.  The 'chapters' are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me..."
7,"The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor. and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds."
10,"I won't bore you with repeating the specs or features of the biscuit joiner as the other reviews cover them quite well. I've had this tool for about 6 months now and am delighted with it. I had the porter cable model which is quite a bit more expensive. I found it to be bulkier to use than the DeWalt and a lot more likely to slip away from your alignment marks than the DeWalt. This cutter has pins on both sides of the blade that go a long way to help keeping the cutter in line with the wood.. The only drawback is that the dust chute will clog with the dust bag installed when cutting into long grained softwoods.Having owned both the porter cable and the Dewalt I must give a big nod to the DeWALT. Smaller and easier to use and a few $$ less."
3,"I've been reading USA Today for over 5 years. I love the content. the features. the pictures. It's my favorite newspaper.Trying out the Kindle version. you get the articles but sometimes they're not formatted correctly. I did notice some black and white photos. Even if they had the photos that accompany the article in black and white that would be good.I tried it for a week while on vacation. I was able to keep up to date with the news but after that week. I decided to cancel it. I can't see myself canceling my print edition to read it on  Kindle.Hopefully. they'll improve it in the future. But now. just try it out for free to see for yourself."
12,"This. for me. was truly a wonderful experience. I've played this game countless times. yet over and over I find myself wondering why. When I first played this game. I had no idea I was immersing myself into the abstract but gorgeous world of Final Fantasy VII. You are the hero. of course. and you're out to save the world. one step at a time. And really. that's exactly what you do in FFVII. In classic Final Fantasy style. the seventh game in the series brings Cloud. a mercenary now working for a terrorist group. into your head. As you play. you can really understand where the characters come from and what their real selves are like. It might sound weird. but this is truly an incredible game. A wonderful experience for anyone who likes this series. or anyone looking for an absolutely outstanding story."
2,"This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other's reviews.but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture.like soft serve as other's have said.so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me.sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact.Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty.also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red."
12,"Words really can describe how wonderful this game is. The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics (note: a 3D card is not required!.) Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions (who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions.) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics. it makes this a very absorbing adventure. This is one of the few games that I can't say anything negative about. This is a must have!"
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
5,"Hey jerks. do you play guitar?  Well. if you do. you need strings.  Well. you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar.  If so. you can stop reading.  If you use strings. you should buy them your damn self.  While you're at it. buy ten sets.  Seriously. are you a child?  Always have extra strings.  D'Addarios last a long time for me. and they sound good.  Also. they're on the bottom end of the price range.  Buy some strings. douchnozzle."
9,"I ordered this 29.5' basketball with the only intention of playing with my young son. Having said that. I was not too worried about getting a more professional ball.For starters I could not play with it out of the package as it did not have enough air in it. so we had to wait until I could have it inflated (unfortunately I do not have the needed tools at home) The ball looks really cool. it is light and has a nice grip.We have had it for a little over a week and we like it so far. again. I am not playing professionally or anything like that. it is a basket ball I am using to teach my young son how to play so. works great for me!"
2,"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However. the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for 'cake decorating ideas' when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly. if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it."
2,"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the 'preservatives' in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half. it was amazing!As for the noise it makes. I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room. closing the door and setting a time. lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year."
4,"I have a lot of fun with this video. I will admit. like a lot of other workouts. it takes some getting used to. I had to do this three times before I learned all the routines. There are very few workouts that I can pick up on the first try.Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke take you through every move and I don't think they are too fast to keep up with.  They stress to go at your own pace. anyway.  (Taebo is just too fast for me)The first time I used this video. my back muscles were a little sore. I also lift light weights (Kathy Smith's weight training of course). so I am used to using my back and arm muscles.I like this video much more than her 'Aerobox Workout'."
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
7,"Bought this in the summer (much cheaper then) and put it out about 2 months ago.  We have our own 'homemade' fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid. combined with the moving water from the fountain.  Night time temps have averaging about 15 F.  The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very. very short. about a foot long.  That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord. It is sturdy and does not get too warm.  You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill."
4,"Of all the movies i've seen about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ. this movie has the most accurate portrayal as I've seen so far even though in the bible Jesus had suffered a far more gruesome beatings than what was shown in film but it's as close as it gets. The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion. However I suggest that people watch this film with caution. it shows alot of graphic stuff including blood and it's definately not for younger children.  It's a great film overall."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
4,"I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!"
7,"These are perfect kabob skewers.  Very sturdy. sharp point to get through food. wide flat edge so the food doesn't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers.  More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these. they should last forever.  Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long.  I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe.  If you have a small grill these may not work.  Otherwise. they are perfect."
2,"I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate. even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds. and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
2,"This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time. When the bag gets full. pop out that one and replace it with a new one. My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug. No. it's not great on the rug. But the floors with dog and cat hair. dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time. Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture. dog pillows. and even the cob webs that appear now and again. This was a marginally careful purchase. My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years. the previous one for eight. Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me."
2,"I absolutely love this corer! It's incredibly easy to use. and the best part is that it doesn't seem to have any sharp edges I can cut myself on. Clutz-approved! Despite lacking sharp edges. it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force. OXO handles are great. as I have quite a few of their other products in my kitchen. and this has lived up to it's non-slip standard. If you miss getting all the seeds out the first time. no worries! It comes out as easily as it goes in and and you can try again. Just try not to get too crazy with it. or you'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left!"
5,"Not much to say. these are your basic hex core. nickel plated round wound strings.  They are the equivalent ofErnie Ball Slinkys (Yellow)They play nice. and feel pretty much the same in my humble (non-touring musician's) opinion.Also. it's nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer.  As a note these come packed together in a single bag. with color coded washers. (as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeve.)In summary. if you're searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren't reading this review. you're out experimenting.  For others. the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more."
9,"I thought I could get away with my standard seat on the new bicycle I got.  It seemed pretty comfortable on my quick ride around the neighborhood.  But after I installed this. I rode 4x around the neighborhood without feeling a thing.  It doesn't seem like it would do much when you put it on. but I have to say it has made my ride feel like air.  It feels like I am just riding on my peddles and frame.  I can't recommend the gel seat enough.  This one fit my bike very well and for a great price.  Highly recommend it!"
4,"I have never had so much fun with an exercise video until I did the 'Latin Workout'. I was very impressed with Kathy and her assistants. The music was marvelous and very authentic. I love Afro-Cuban music. I really worked up a sweat. You can get a lot out of this video when you put more effort into the moves. This video is so enjoyable the time just flies by. I really had to get used to moving my hips. It felt so dirty but in a nice and sexy sort of way. I can exercise to this video everyday. So if anyone is considering starting an exercise program with a lot of fun. start off with this video."
12,"Street fighter alpha 3 might be the best street fighter out there to date. It has awesome game modes cool levels and best of all its the never ending fun of a 2d fighter. The graphics are what you would expect froma 3d fighter a little choppy and an occasional glitch or two or maybe an occasional mergence of fighters but all in all its one of my favorite game out there. Ihave been an avis street fighter fan all the way back to the SNES version of street fighter 2 turbo! i would encourage anybody to get street fighter alpha 3 because its fun and hey its down to 20 bucks now!"
7,"We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews. we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon. the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck. if you're old enough to remember!!"
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
9,"This is a wonderful ball.  I know because we bought the first one over a year ago for my son's birthday.  We bought one similar maybe the exact one before but he didn't write his name on it and it never came back home after a practice.  It has a nice 'sticky' grip. feels secure when grasp. and for preparing to shoot. It holds air well and doesn't need to be re-inflated except maybe check it at the start of the season.  Has a nice vibrant feel to the bounce and is all that you'd expect in a quality ball.  I highly recommend it to all. It even arrives inflated for immediate play."
10,"This is a dead-on accurate piece of art right out of the box. I use it in shop for many fine furniture cuts that need to be tuxedo accurate instead of using my radial arm saw. In the rough construction field. it works all day long on a small honda (2000) generator with no complaints. If you knock it out of alignment from roughing it up too much in the field (all saws will suffer from this fate.) just take the time to square it up. and you're good to go again! I have found absolutely no issues with this product"
3,"I wish I could give half stars. If so. I would give this 3 1/2 stars. but I can't so I will be nice and give it 4. It's not a bad book for the price (I got mine for $0.99). I will say that the editing was simply atrocious. but if you can get around that. it is a quick read. The characters are likeable and the story moves along pretty quickly. However. there were a few parts that I felt were too contrived and not overly believable to actually happen in real life. BUT. the love scenes were HOT and steamy. very well done. I finished this in a day. so go ahead and read this if you are a fan of the author (which I am) and are interested in escaping reality for a few hours."
9,"First. let me tell you that I have not yet ordered the larger size bottle from Amazon. but sure will! I wanted to try it first by getting the smallest bottle from Kroger to see how I liked it.I started by filling up my hand soap dispensers and then showering with it and I really like it! My skin feels so light and clean and not dry at all.I have not shampooed with it (a little scared to although I don't know why?); nor have I cleaned with it yet. For cleaning. I only use a vinegar/water spray and I'm happy with that.The peppermint is invigorating and fun but a friend of mine tells me I might like some of the other fragrances better. I would love to try them all!Once I have tried other things. I might update my review to 5 stars but didn't think it was quite honest or fair to do so yet.You'll be glad you made the switch!"
8,"This cat food contains a lower level of magnesium than the 'supermarket' cat foods. Low magnesium levels help to prevent urethra problems. especially in male cats due to their more narrow urethra. I would rather pay the higher price for this brand of cat food than bring my cats to an emergency vet in the middle of the night because their urinary tract gets blocked. not to mention the aggravation caused to the cat. Other brands of low magnesium cat food include Iam's and Nutro-Max. Hill's Science Diet food is round-shaped. rather than 'hooked'. which makes it easier for one of my older tooth-challenged cats to swallow."
9,"[update 10/24/2008]  My daughter is now four - we still use the trailer for long rides and she still loves it.  The construction of the unit is decent and has held up well.----The trailer is really easy to set up - five minutes if you have a quick release for the back wheel of the host bike.  The ride is pleasant (meaning very smooth) for both the parent and child.  Like others have mentioned. the toddler loves their personal space.  Plenty of 'whees' when we coast down hills.I envision after my toddler out grows the trailer that I can use it for running errands.This is a non-brainer purchase."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
5,"Simple. compact. well constructed. easy to use. and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo. designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make. each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar. Heritage Cherry Sunburst). aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar. Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge. andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar. Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck. it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock. Not a huge deal. but a consideration."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
7,"I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents. none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%. not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon. my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys. you should too."
7,"This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant!  (If you can bear to think of it that way!)  It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches.  I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner--and I don't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that's too thick for it.  Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes. too.  The length comes in real handy when I'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods. we'll be pruning our roses in mid-February.  So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores."
2,"This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.  Its black. rubberized grip has a section of 'gills' that molds to your grip for better control.  When you're done. just pop it in the dishwasher.  The only drawback is that with long term use. the 'gills' sometimes break off.  It took years for that to happen to mine (only one section).This is hardly an elegant device. but it works well and is perfect for everyday and outdoor use.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
3,"The book. originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic. reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published. especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic. it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However. I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created.  The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted. but it DOES have photographs. The decision. therefore. is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos. while not spectacular. greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition."
10,"I bought one of these for light duty planing tasks - relieving corners. cutting dowels flush and etc.  You do have to hone the pre-ground edge  before you use it the first time.  It is ground to 25 degrees and  recommended final angle is 30 after honing.  I used a Veritas honing guide  and a Japanese water stone to do the job.  It only took about 5 minutes  with the right tools!The mouth is easily adjustable with the front knob  to regulate the size of your curls.  The blade is easy to adjust with the  brass knob at the back.  It is easy to grip and use.  I look forward to  getting may years of use out of this well made tool!"
7,"We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile. I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden."
5,"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name. but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product. but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret. my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me. my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too..."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
2,"Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.  Bought one two days ago and bought a load of milk and supplies cause figured it would take 5 or 6 times to get it right.  have made 4 ice creams already.  So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.  used mostly the recipes that came with the machine except that being lactose intolerant. i used lactaid milk and also used baking splenda instead of sugar.  It worked out fine. But. i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.  and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.  We are real happy with this for sure."
8,"I have 3 spoiled dogs.  Puperoni was the only pricey soft treat they'd eat.  Then I tried beef Zukes as something cheaper and different.  They smell awful to me. but the dogs all grabbed these little squares and gobbled them up....to my surprise.  I then bought the Chicken Zuke's. which they rejected.  So It's back to the beef recipe.  Since all my dogs are older. I figured that the extra benifit of 'hip action' would be a good thing"
3,"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder. a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls. vampires. and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book. The Mister Trophy. hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them. I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third. longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank. what are you and Samhain waiting for?"
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
9,"I like to have this small one in my pocket for daily use.  It's small enough so it is less bulky than my car key and alarm bob.  It has the basic knife. combination screwdriver and nail file. and a small scissor; everything I've needed in a pinch when at work or out-and-about.  There's a pull out tweezer and toothpick. but I rarely use those.  Unfortunately. I had to give my last one to TSA at the airport.  I've gotten so used to slipping it into my pocket. it's hard to purposely not take it along."
8,"I have 2 cats and one is getting chubby. plus I'm tired of always feeding them regularly.  I needed this for when I was out of town anyway. This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them. I don't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site. Besides. it's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom---a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that."
3,"I wasn't sure to expect when I ordered this book. I've heard great reviews. but sometimes when I get around to reading the book. it just doesn't live up to the hype. Not so in this case.I sincerely enjoyed this tale of the young. innocent Oliver Twist and his story of misfortune. While the novel was darker and more violent than I'd at first anticipated. the language flows like poetry. I loved the roller coaster ride Dickens takes us on as Oliver searches to escape the evils forced upon him. only to be pulled back in. The build to the climax of the story was expertly formulated and executed.Oliver Twist is a classic in the true sense of the word. If you've not had the pleasure of reading this novel. don't delay. Order it today."
9,"Lets face it. its not worth putting an expensive scope on a .22 rifle.  I put this on my Remington 597 plinker rifle and it works great.  I shot a few hundred rounds this last weekend at 50 yards and had no problems with the scope.  For [...] bucks. its a steal!  The scope is built well and comes with a wrench for the scope rings.  The scope is easy to sight in as well.  You can't really use your fingers. but you can use a spent casing or coin to turn it."
5,"I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff.I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so.It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as 'black' as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings.They also seem to have more 'string squeak' when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that 'vintage tone' but they do sound decent.However. for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings (.009-.042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings. Super Light. 9-42.EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me. but I am a Da-Dairy-O man. for now."
3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"Aerobie rings are awesome as for distance. though you have to have good control.  Otherwise. you may find it leaves your neighborhood.It's good for kids when learning. because it will still fly if they flub the toss.They don't hold up to UV and weather really well.  A year in the backyard and the plastic is faded and brittle.  YMMV. but it should last a long time if you bring it in when you're done with it.Be advised that while the image shows a three-pack. you get only one.  They're a little pricey. but not too bad if you're expecting it."
9,"I cannot recommend this grill/griddle enough. since it is so versatile and easy to use and clean.  It makes a whole breakfast from bacon and eggs and pancakes. Flip it over and it is an excellent grill for meats and fish.  And it works well on gas and charcoal cook surfaces as well as electric.  I has a gas stove and am always in awe whenever I use it since it makes cooking so much fun.  And the price is excellent.  I have scads of cast iron from this grill/griddle. to fry pans of all sizes. and cornbread pans and other items.  Stuff never wears out and gets handed down generation to generation."
2,"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating. & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter. too.  Tonight. I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
8,"I recently got a puppy who is chewing on everything. except most of the puppy toys.  This is one of the exceptions.  He loves it.  His two favorite things are his Mr. Bill doll and his bully stick.  Both of them are holding up well.  If I activate the &#34;Oh. noooooo&#34; sound. he pounces on it and jumps around.  If he activates it in his mouth. he does a demonstration of the shaken baby syndrome and runs around the house.  I am amazed at the abuse this toy has taken.  If he ever destroys it. I will be getting him another.  As to the reviewer who bought it for his brother. not realizing it was a dog toy. I am sure any fan of Mr. Bill (and maybe even those who have never heard of Mr. Bill) would love to have this doll."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
5,"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well. I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also. you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little 'comb' that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me. and the Vox is very good. I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
8,"This is in no way a Giant cat litter pan. lol. I ordered it based on the description that it was larger than large-that it was giant. I have a cat on the larger side and thought this would be bigger than the large pans found in pet stores.It's not.I ordered a large cat litter pan from amazon for $5.99 that is larger than this one.The pan is of nice quality though. I think it would be perfect for a medium sized kitty.I'll be returning this. False advertising is a pet peeve."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
5,"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it. a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable. there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft"
8,"At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so. it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better. but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use. the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it. but it just won't go in reverse. Overall. this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY."
9,"I wish they had the attachment to use different socket tips. FIrst day I took it up into the Alpine regieon of the Rocky MOuntains. BAMB! I cut my thumb on the blade!  Old EMT trainng came into effect ... hehe.  I will comment later when I use it more. I bought this to see how will the saw blades will work for carving/sawing wooden triggers for snares and dead falls. Not sure this device will be up to it.It's slick and easy to keep clean.  The pouch is nice and I wear it when I go out of the house I do have confidence it will come in handy for several years.UPDATE:After 3 months I bought another as my son wanted a version of a Leatherman ... so I bought him this one. Be careful ... I cut myself again!"
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
2,"I suddenly had a need for more paring knives so I decided to buy four various models on Amazon to try them out.  This is by far my favorite.  They are extremely sharp and the rubberized grip is very comfortable.  When I reach into my drawer I tend to want to grab this knife over the others but have to tell myself to rotate through all of them.  I've had it for over three months now with use almost every three days and so far no sign of any type of oxidation or staining.  I wash it in a dishwasher all the time as well."
2,"I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto. missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks."
12,"Made in 98. but still better quality. play. and design than most games on the market in '05.  Good storyline. great AI and graphics. not-overly aggressive system requirments. tons of add-ons available.  Incredible single player mode. good weapon selection. and arguably one of the best FPS online games of all time.  If you like HALO. you will like Halflife.  Very similar. but no limit on how many weapons you can carry. and the levels aren't as repetative.  (My biggest complaint about Halo. though it's obvious why. many of the levels and hallways are exact copies of one you've seen dozens of times already...gives a feeling of being lost. and even fed up at times.) Halo does have the edge as far as cars and what not though. I also recommend Halflife 2. the sequel to what I'm talkin about here...  INSANE graphics and gameplay."
10,"Great instructions allow this stand to be put together with few tools and frustration in a short time.  The ability to assemble the stand with a built in tilt is great for clearing chips from the saw by gravity as it is in operation.  They even supply a few extra pieces of the assembly nuts and bolts in case you loose one of the small easy to loose parts.  Far better than having one or two short and not being able to finish the assembly with out a trip to the local hardware store.  The tripod design insures all feet will remain flat on the floor at all times.  Not too wide so it takes up little floor space in a smaller shop.  Light weight and strong. it serves well."
8,"We have been using this for less then a week and our 14 year old Pit Bull X is running around like a 9 year old!!! She had been starting to make ALLOT of cracking noises while stretching. especially in her neck and we noticed her slowing down.  Within 2 days the cracking sound is gone and she is able to go for family walks again and keep up with her 4 year old Catahoula brother.  Added bonus is that she LOVES the taste of the gravy that you get when you add water to the powder... I can't recommend this product enough and will be ordering the 20 lb once the 5 lb container is finished."
2,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6&quot; utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy. it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
9,"I have owned a Stanley thermos for years and they were built like a tank and made in the USA. I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is. While it may look like the old American made Stanley. it is just a veneer of it's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk. I would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation. Don't waste your money as the companies soul died some time ago."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
9,"We have three of these. one for each kid. They have been well used by all three children and have held up well to the use. They fold down to a very slim size that fits well under our seats or in our trunk. We have had them for some time and the children are able to fold them up and open them up without extra help from mom and dad (always a plus).The one negative that I have found is that if you get the lever that is used to lock the scooter open (or closed) at all dirty it will jam and not open or shut very easily. A quick clean will fix this. but it is something to watch for.A small adult can easily use this with no difficulties. If you are a heavier adult or tall. you might want to look for a sturdier scooter meant to hold adults.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
10,"I bought this for a one person shop.  My original intent was to have one hose and pull it to the tool I was using.1st. If you plan to use cheaper hose in a one tool per time system. the fact that the in-feed is on top of the unit. the weight of the hose will crimp thinner hoses.2nd. this sucker does not roll for beans. it has 4 wheels two are fixed and to rotate. if you happen to be pulling in the direction that the rear wheels are pointing (Rarely are you pulling to where you already are) you're good. if not your in trouble.I ran a more permanent system and with blast gates it has plenty of power to run jointers. planers router tables.  Just myobservations."
12,"Played it for the first time. after it has been out for over ten years.  Great game.  The puzzles are hard. but not impossible to solve.  If you truly love Myst. then you will certainly love this game.  (Do not use walkthroughs. it ruins the game!)  Also. keep in mind that the 5-CD Riven set is for outdated computers.  It will most likely not run on Vista or XP. at least not without some major glitches.  Wish I had played this sooner."
12,"All in all. this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time. Of course. it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female. evil castle. jump on enemies. etc. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that. occasionally. it works really well. Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection. Although we question Nintendo's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president. they did so for a good cause. and a damn good game."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Bought the pink one for dd so she could have a scooter like her brothers.She gets around on that thing too fast i think lol.What can i say it is a Razor they are the best. We have a few other brands and they are not as easy to close up and store as the Razors are.Great scooter and super way for them to get good exercise and just enjoy being a kid! Too bad i never had one growing up oh wait that is ok because honestly i use theirs sometimes lol!"
10,"If you get this on sale its not a bad kit.  I have used the bisket tip and found that helpfull and I like the roller a lot.  You only have so much working time and the faster you can get the glue where you want it the better.  Also you want full coverage but as little squeeze out as possible.  Any glue smeared on the wood and your stains wont take.  This kit would be better with about three bottles because you usually need more than one tip at a time (or tips and the roller).  Most of the tips are for wooden dowels. I could have used a few less of those."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
4,"It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles.  I also did not experience in the fervent passion and zeal that the movie was supposedly causing.I think the hype is a bit much for the product.I'd advise you not to have 'treats' or a meal as you watch this movie.  We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time.  This movie is pure ancient Roman gore.  This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie.  It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out.  It's unnerving to think of how many 'Boots' sat out in those movie theaters. and how many are now sitting in the livingroom with  'mummsy and dahdah.' I mean we're talking graphic angles of torture devices on the skin as never before seen etc."
8,"I have a 2 year old male tabby and a 6 year old female tuxedo cat. Both of them are slightly overweight so I started feeding them this dry cat food a year ago. 4 month ago my male cat developed urinary track blockage (crystal) so we have to keep him on canned food diet. We couldn't be sure the exact cause of the blockage (food. stress. genetic...) My female cat would not eat canned food so we let her keep eating Pro Plan's Weight Management dry food.Now my female cat got urinary track  blockage as well!  I am kicking myself have been keeping her on this dry food.Do not feed your cat this food. Urinary track blockage is very costly to treat. Once they get it. it could be a life long battle. Be carful!"
10,"I purchased this as a first plate jointer to get some experience with how they can be used in my projects.  I haven't experienced the issues with noise that several reviewers have noticed.  Considering many of these jointers can go for double the money. and that my projects are relatively basic. this seemed to be a good match.  I think this is a great unit for beginners or as a backup unit.UPDATE FEBRUARY 2009 - When I bought this unit. I figured it'd be good for maybe a year or two.  Four years out. it continues strong.  It has an annoying tendency for the chip chute to clog up from time to time. which takes a bit of effort to unclog.  But it does great work. and with a little bit of care ensuring your alignment is clean. it works well.  Wish all of my tools were as bulletproof."
10,"It seems that every class of tool has one brand or model that really works just right. Others try to upstage it with different gimmicks. but the obvious best choice keeps coming through. You see it on jobsite after jobsite. P/C routers. Skil wormdrives. Senco finish nailers. Bosch jigsaws...In the 3x21 sander category there is no better tool. Simple. balanced. sturdy  and inexpensive for the long-haul.Square shape and small body mean that one-handed operation (large hand) is practical. allowing for use in ways to which other models don't adapt well.This is my second one in (I don't remember. 15?) years. but a long time anyway. Someone decided they needed my first one more than I did and helped themselves; it'll probably last them forever if they were smart enough to keep it. So I got the latest iteration which is just still the best. I think I paid about the same the first time too."
7,"As a Christmas gift to a friend. I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds. not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice. gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!"
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
8,"I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle.  I thought no way does she tear through this &#34;indestructible&#34; teddy bear.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off... What a joke.  KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage.  I read the reviews and thought &#34;well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog&#34;... NOPE. my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes.  Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys."
2,"There was a review titled &#34;Didn't Fit&#34; which stated:&#34;Be warned! If you are looking for the &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; bag for a Hoover Wind Tunnel vac. don't assume a &#34;Type Z&#34; bag will fit....it won't!&#34;I don't doubt the reviewer got a product which doesn't fit.  Maybe hoover does weird things.  I double checked. and the previous bags I used were &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; - the last one is still in the vacuum.  I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine.  So. I'm not sure what happened with the poor fellow which got ones which didn't fit. but worked just fine for me.It's the genuine hoover product. not the knockoffs sold on here as well.  I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever. when these bags last months.  Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly."
4,"This movie was great. my wife and I decided to go see it last Saturday night. Jesus was played by the young and attractive heart throb. James Caviezel. Jesus was taunted ruthlessly. Jesus was beaten mercilessly. Jesus was whipped until every inch of his body bled. Jesus was kicked. spit on. and humiliated. Finally he was crucified.Needless to say my wife and went home and I had the best sex of our life after later that night after the flick.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it wasn't Monica Bellucci who did the whipping."
4,"this is the type of movie I would definitly recommend it for first time viewer but on personal note I would also say I will never watch this again. the thing is despite its christ we are talking about. it is still very hard for me to looking at a man being tortured like a hanging lamb in the kitchen while is considering myself is being entained in a movie.. IT IS TOO GROSS! the fact is it goes beyond the line there are anything horible things you ve seen in movie theater. that's what credit this movie as one unforgettable one in history. By comparing this to Hannibal. Hann is barely just a little kid's nitemare. Every minute of this movie chanllenge your sense to tolerante the scale of brutality upon someone to a new level. I would say if your a believer it could work better since the man you looking at aint normal human to you after all. so its more relief since its a 'super being' is tortured but not human like you and me..."
12,"When I had this game. I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game. It's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you. It has a four player mode. which is not bad. but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although. that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games. too. I wouldn't mind playing this. Oh. I have the one on Gameboy Advance. which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64. Now. that confused me."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
2,"My last masher (from a respected and pricey brand name) couldn't take the pressure-literally!  One day I'm just mashing up a batch of potatoes and *snap&#34; it's time for the trash bin.  That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid. heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.  I'm not sure I could break it if I tried!  Works great at mashing (just as good as one with square or circle holes). and the large grip makes it easy to hold even if you get a little butter on your hands (trust me. I have done it)."
11,"If I'm being honest. I must mention that although this game specifies 'thirteen and older' as its primary audience. the reality is that twelve and under kids are most likely going to enjoy this game. It's a party game that families can play. but accomplishing the tasks on the cards is more like kid-oriented fun. Gathering beads in order to win is the object. but unlike the real Mardi Gras there is no 'adults only' behavior involved. I rated the durability high. but again this is a game that should appeal to younger kids - who are prone to losing things like the strings of beads or the cards. The game comes in kind of a cool clear. soft vinyl case. I liked the 'mind control' category the best. which entails a little more subtle strategy that getting someone to refuse to pick your trash or finding someone who likes vampires more than werewolves. This is a game I can't imagine bringing out very often and its kind of expensive for what it is."
5,"I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means. but for what they're worth. I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price. ability to collapse. and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
2,"I got the 35-gallon size to store some items in the basement that I wanted to be able to get to conveniently but also be able to lock up and keep out of the kids' hands. This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course. I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that. but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is. I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it. I recommend you get the 'cable' style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible. but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable."
9,"UPDATE:  Initially gave this 5 stars because of good function.  But after only 9 months. the rubber that seals the goggles against the eyes is cracking and brittle.  I din't expect them to last forever but less than a year is still disappointing.  They have been used fairly heavily I would say.  END OF UPDATE.  Sometimes I hesitate to buy something because it seems too cheap.  These aren't going to last forever but what they do well is keep water out of your eyes and they have flat lenses so your view isn't distorted like with some goggles.  We'll see how long they last."
4,"The overall impression of this movie is of a very nice movie for children; almost everything about this movie is suitably designed for young children. I have not read the books and watched this one on a hunch. The movie was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching all the way to the end but I would expect many members of the younger audience. pre-teen for example. to enjoy the movie much more.Of the actors only one was familiar and that was Dean Jones and he was also one of the few that didn't specifically look like they were acting.The scenery was beautiful and had some very lovely settings in the woods of North Carolina. The overall ambience of the movie was appropriate for a young audience as well. This is a good solid move for children and I recommend it as such."
11,"I got this for a six hour car drive to entertain a 4 year old boy.  It kept him busy for quite a while. I don't let my son play with car toys except when we are on long trips (they stay novel then and he is kept busy for longer requiring less frequent stops and we can keep driving) so I can't speak about durability or if the wax sticks will keep up their sticking power.  It took my son a while to realize he didn't have to follow the books directions and could make his own designs but I think that is a function of age rather than product design.  Over all I think this is a worth while purchase for travel."
3,"Kasey Johnson is a professional basketball player.  His twin brother Garrett is a famous actor. They're both gay but Kasey isn't out.  Ingram Fletcher is the owner of Liverpool. a night club that Kasey and Garrett frequent. Gram has been secretly attracted to Kasey for a long time. Kasey likes Gram as well. but he can't come out to the public. Can one night of passion ever be anything more?Out of Bounds is a sweet romance with a lot of hot sex. Kasey is charming and Gram is sexy. They face prejudice and have to hide their relationship but they're stronger for it.  Out of Bounds is a good story.Nannettereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"Just finished the second book &#8220;View To Kill&#8221; in this very sensational storyline. what can you say about characters that are so well written that they grab you from the beginning and not let go even after the story is finished.  This story maybe short but it is a joy to read. to devour and not want the story to end. the character of Sachin was terrific. he saved her. watched her as she matured into a fantastic women. and how he loves her. he definitely has a wonderful match in Paige. a perfect pair."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
2,"We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001.  I installed a bag and thought it worked OK.  (I did not throw the former bags. not Hoover bags. out.)  The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously.  My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference.  After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use.  I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured.  While not very scientific. it convinced us.  I have thrown the other bags away.Additional Comment:Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag. I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag.  This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house."
2,"This is a great. old-fashioned style of potato masher. which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood. What it has. though. that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design. with a comfortable handle. It also contains a hole at the top of the handle for hanging on a rack.This is excellent not only for potatoes. but for apples. carrots. various kinds of squash. turnips and other soft-cooked fruits and vegetables.The masher is made of durable stainless steel that helps you avoid rust."
4,"I hated it from the beginning to the end.  The plot was too predictable with very little surprises.  The lines were weak and uninspiring.  You come to a point where you literally want to see Jesus die so that the suffering would end for the viewer. Talk about flogging a theme. this one wins. palms down!Again I got caught up with the hype and controversy. regarding this film.  I made a promise to myself that this would be the last film that I shall purchase. before I see it first. so help me God!"
9,"I've been using Fireline in my beading projects for about eight years. and it works great for when you're using Swarovski crystals or beads that have sharp edges.The 6-pound count is nice for beads that are heavier and projects that have more weight to them.You just need to be really careful not to knot your projects; quite a few beading instructors have been warning that knots will break with this. and I've seen it happen when they demonstrate it.The smoke color will leave a grey residue on your fingers. but I rub it through a piece of Kleenex to take it off before I wax my thread. and have no problems.I was so happy to find this on Amazon since it's much cheaper to buy it here than from a beading store or beading website!"
3,"I got one book. for free from my libary (# 3) so at that time I did not even realize these were a series.  But I really enjoyed that one so I went back to start at the beginning with this book.  I don't think you have to read them in order. there is enough information that I did not feel lost reading them out of order.  I really liked the story of this first book. the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
7,"So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find yourself strung out.Black & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn Mower"
2,"I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot. I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet. I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
2,"This product is getting great reviews for good reason. Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First. freeze the bowl overnight. Second. chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla. not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things. I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream. which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things. I've found that I create milkshakes. and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly. the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly. and I'll experiment with those recipes."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
11,"I love popup books and interactive children's books. and have to admit: this is one of my favorites. It's not complex/intricate. but it has a very cute storyline which combines colors. animals. and an interactive ribbon. If kids could make their own books. I think this is the kind they would make. Brilliantly done! I love how each page reveals a new color being added to the rainbow. and that when you turn the last page it 'reloads' the book so it's ready to read again."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
3,"This book didn't really go the way I thought it would.  For one. I expected more action overall with the fact that Griffin is being hunted and I also didn't expect him to find out about Jarrah so quickly.  The dystopian society was a nice touch but I would have liked some more detail about it to make the backbone of the story a little stronger.  Overall I liked the story but. honestly. I think it would've been better if there had been more conflict; really the entire thing was just too EASY and that's a shame because I could see the potential for a more in depth story."
8,"After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy. Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing. Shouldn't this information be on the box if it's so important? I called the manufacturer and was 'serviced' by very argumentative representative. I don't think the product is worth the money at all. A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog. You are better off buying from Hartz. At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb."
5,"This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last. The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series. which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1.2.or 3. I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele. The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun. (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder)."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
11,"This game is laid out simply enough. all you need to do is collect the cards at the four corners and avoid turning into a zombie in the process. It takes some strategy though. 'Do I want this bonus or this one?' 'Do I go forward or double back?' The other cool thing is that your role in the game switches when you lose a battle to a zombie (roll a die and get a number less than the number on their card). Upon becoming Zombified. your new goal becomes making your teammates meet the same fate. Fantastic game. even cooler that it's based off the show."
3,"OK. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this 'free' book written in the 1800s.  I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics.  I had just received my Kindle and figured. what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down.  It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess.  This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future."
2,"I'll be honest; I don't get much exposure to a great variety of vegetable peelers. but I would hazard a guess that this is one of the best.I bought this based on the other good Amazon reviews and have not regretted it. Its sharp and very efficiently does its job.My sister came over for Christmas and after using it on a few dozen vegetables was so impressed that she went out the next day to find one of her own. I have a reputation in my family for buying the best of the best. no matter the cost. so she was very surprised to find this peeler was so cheap.Buy it. it just works."
2,"OXO designs great products and this is no exception.  It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.  I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much. I bought one for my aunt.Before this. I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher."
5,"I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar. and will soon replace them.  On quality control. the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it. two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected. but it looks bad.  On sound. these seemed okay at first. but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week. especially the high B and E steel strings. which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck. more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."
4,"This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever."
9,"got this for my savage fvsr .22lr .first yess the poi changes with the zoom . but you can figure that out and hold over ...on mills to compensate for poi moving...example-if u got zeroed at 9x and take it down to 6x same shott would be low.vise versa if you zeroed  on 6x ...so with the scope holding off on mils  still able to get decent 1.5 in groups at 150yrds with 22.lr and 3$ammo !! go to rimfirecentral.com to see many of the targets .yes the 9x is lil low on shooting  100yrd+ on paper but doable ...if they had a 500mm with 16x woulda been sweet"
3,"So. this book is long. and packed with lots of sex. The story is ok...but it seems to really just be background for sex scene after sex scene. To me. some of the descriptions of the sex went to the cheesey side of sex...rather than the erotic...but it was hot. And the description of his 'cannon' and use of it as a name...really?I guess I only gave it 3 stars because there really could have been more story here. I would have liked for it to have gone on in the end a little as to how it actually ended. To me. it just sorta stopped.So. If you are into hot and heavy steamy sex this is the book for you. If you want story with a side of steamy sex. this may be a bit much."
3,"Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com."
2,"I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.  I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM. 0.8 Sones. Energy Star Fan).  The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least). which I do.  They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.  And they shut-off the fans consistently.  No complaints.  I would purchase one of these again. if it ever failed."
8,"My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat (so take that Ogden Nash!).  She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys. especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty. you might try these."
5,"I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. I've never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic. it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If you're wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings. definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not. but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board."
2,"I love OXO utensils and have many of them.  But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher.  Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water. right?  The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum.  Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel.  It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils."
12,"This is my favorite Duke Nukem game. It's got a ton of levels to explore and the variety in the levels keeps things interesting. I played it when it first came out for the N64 and after beating it traded it. I got nostalgic for it so bought it again last year to play. What a great trip down memory lane. I was taken back to the first time I played it and it was just as fun. The graphics look even better on my 46' lcd than they ever did on my old tube tv. A great game for those who like older shooters with some humor."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."
5,"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example. I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em. use them daily. and rely on them !!!"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
5,"I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs. but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string. but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic. for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat. very pleased there as well."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"This product seemed to work for a couple of weeks at controlling fleas on our indoor dog who only goes out for exercise and to potty.  However one morning while combing her I noticed something stuck to her skin and much to my surprise it was a tick!  I thought it was very strange that the tick would be on her and still be alive considering that Frontline specifically states that it is for controlling both fleas and ticks.  Moving forward another month and it happened again - another tick.  This time I decided that this product just does not stand up to it's guarantee. nor does it work as advertised.  I will not buy again.Have since switched products. and have not experienced the same issue again."
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
2,"This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker. and it's never let me down.  Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home. when the ice cream is done. it will . . . still be soft. but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.'  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy. but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
3,"What do you get when you mix sci-fi and romance? Well if you're Cathryn Cade you get a compelling mix of the best of both genre's.In Tyger. Tyger Burning Bright we are introduced to the crew of the The Orion. the space ship version of a cruise ship. We meet some of the crew but this novel centers around the ships navigation officer Tyron Jag who goes through the mating shift while trying to navigate the new ship through an area of space that needs his expertise. We also meet Calla Fellura a novice crew member and the ships interpreter.The heat between Ty and Calla is intense. this is a total panty wringer. it is also amazingly well written with characters that are funny as well as sexy and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages and reaching for the next book. The world that has been created and the species that are developed are both fun and imaginative.While each novel is self contained it is best read in order so the sub plots in the novels are more understood."
9,"I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough. but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately. so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long. long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
9,"This Coleman stove has two 10.000 BTU burners that have independently adjustable flames that let you simultaneously boil water (on HIGH) or simmer (on LOW) whatever it is you desire. You can hook in a single propane cylinder tank that gives you 45 to 60 minutes on HIGH depending on your atmospheric conditions. This is a Coleman PerfectFlow stove that allows regulation of the propane pressure so some use and experimentation will get you desired results. It is a small unit. but it is very versatile and well-crafted. This Coleman stove has adjustable sides that allow for larger cookware and/or use to control temperature. Matches or such are needed to ignite the propane fueled flame. The bottom line on this unit is that it can really throw out heat and it is easily regulated."
3,"Can a woman from an abusive background find love and a lasting relationship. Apparently so. Can she find the love she needs in a menage a trois? Apparently so. Chris is able to overcome the trauma of being raised by an alcoholic abusive father and a mother who was completely submissive to him. Throw in a brother who has grown up to be just like the father and this poor girl has a lot to overcome. She did with the help of her lovers Jon and TJ. This is a short read can be done in one evening. While not out standing was entertaining. Chris is to be given a lot of credit for her strength in overcoming her horrible background."
7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"this game lacked the ability to live up to name 'Tomb Raider' its more of a 'City Raider' half the levels deal with city-time scenery. and 80% of the enemies are humans. more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities (Venice) so i cant complain too much - just wasnt feelin the whole China scene. I liked to level skip those. and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week. just run around and jump for the most part."
2,"I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.  I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.  This little 'mighty mite' packs a big punch.  Superb suction. compact and light weight. but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful. and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum."
12,"Okay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings. Some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get. And it has the exact same plot as every other Mario game. OMFG Bowser stole Peach whatever shall we do?! Get an ugly princess or something! And where the hell are the king and queen anyways?! The hats were also poorly implemented. The Flying cap is hard to use. the metal cap is rare. at best. and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap. They should have stuck to the 2D side scroller. And also where is Yoshi?! The fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustrating."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
4,"This movie does have entertainment value. and it is affordable enough to entertain some friends at home on a rainy day.  The video is grainy. almost 16mm like in appearance.  The music and sound effects during the fights scenes reminds me of the 60's campy hooded crimefighter shows. ZAP!  BOOM!  POW!  Holy Low budget Cinema! is what Jack Nicholsons trusty sidekick would say if he had one.  There is a story and it is ok.  Buy it for your collection. otherwise pass."
5,"Its OK. the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank. i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can't complain about it not being worth what i paid for it. i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive. more adjustable and just more versatile. would i buy this. yes if i didn't try anything else first. nuff said."
12,"I'm not a great fun of Microsoft but I have to admit that they did a great job with this joystick. just for once. I bought the Saitek Cyborg 3D. Same price. It was horrible. Unstable. It was cool looking but what's the use a  cool joystick when you can't land your plane with it because it sends  random signals to your pc? Sidewinder is precise and reliable.  Also it's  multipurpose. I use it for Falcon 4 and Need for Speed and it's great with  both."
2,"I'm a long time fan of Oxo products. but this isn't one of my favorites. Based on an earlier review. I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream. The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out (doesn'5t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I've tried it both ways). Furthermore. after about 6 months of use. the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop. and feels &quot;wobbly&quot;. It's also not all that easy to get clean. The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher doesn't do the job. It's going to be replaced - just don't know if it'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand.  I"
5,"One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings.  In my opinion they're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever.  I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less-expensive alternative.I certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars.  I've heard no other string that has the crisp. clean. rich sound of this brand of strings.  I've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand... but always come back to this one.Different diameter strings will sound significantly different. depending on the guitar you use.  I prefer this mid-range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone.  Any lighter and the guitar sounds 'tinny'. any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck.  These are 'just right'."
7,"Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed. I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old. thick branches.)"
12,"it was nice to see some of the greatest Nintendo characters come togeather in one game but all else form that this game is just to make your eyes sore!!! again i say these kinda games are for kids plain and simple.The game repetitive . annoying . trivial and of course my favorite definition meaningless to me. i felt that alot more could have been done to make this game a great classic. but only the characters can stand out!!!! nothing else. not even the game play. my little bro loves this game so i guess it's worth a play if you have an infantile intellects laterzzzz folks / gamers"
4,"Usually the first movie is the best one. and here it is true.  Ghidorah was always my favorie film in the Godzilla series.  We have some great monster battles. well detailed sets for destroying. and get to see Ghidorah with the meanness he's meant to have. only otherwise seen in Destroy all Monsters.  Both versions are very clean both visually and in audio.  The dubbed version is probably the one we all grew up seeing... with a lot of the added in music which. I feel. adds greatly to the film.  This is the copy all Godzilla fans ought to pick up."
8,"I've wanted to buy one of these fountains for my kitties for years.Last week it was one of the Deals on Amazon. so I splurged and bought a $25 gift for my kitties!They love it. I like having it there. it makes barely any noise. just a light trickle. The kitties love it. drink from it and play with the water stream.It's got a nice long cord. though I need an extension to put it where I want it. I like the on/off switch on the cord. and the water filter. It came with extra filters. at least a year's supply. Great value."
4,"I think it's great that the popularity of a recent film (Julie & Julia) has once again brought Julia Child into the spotlight.  When this series first aired in the mid 80's. I remember watching it to learn the essentials of food preparation and short cuts.  The very day I found out it was available. I immediately preordered.This two DVD set comes with an instructional booklet.  On the first. you will find Poultry. Meats and Vegetables.  On the second. Soups. Salads and Bread. Fish and Eggs. and First Courses and Desserts.  Both DVDs are well chaptered. so if you just want to watch one particular sub-chapter. you don't have to sift through an entire topic in order to do so.  As always. Julia is instructive. professional and completely enthusiastic.  Buy this now (together with the companion bookThe Way to Cook) and. if you haven't already. also get the newly releasedBaking With Julia"
4,"Robson Green and Michael Kitchen as two-thirds of a love triangle! I so enjoyed this production for so manyreasons. It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy. Well written. well acted. well designed. I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men. I bet if anyone asked her.she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career. I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent.Great fun."
7,"Since we live in the country. we have a lot of wildlife in our yard.  While they are cute to look at. they can do a lot of damage. and some of them don't smell very good(SKUNKS)!  We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer 'trimmed' all our shrubs. even the ones right next to the house. Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year. we didn't have that problem this past winter; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway. I love watching all the wildlife. and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden."
11,"I ordered this game because my two children. aged 7 and 12. love games and they also love Rudolph.The game is basically a combination board game/ dvd game.  The DVD shows some clips from the movie and the game action is in the form of moving your pieces on the board.The kids were excited to try it.  It was simple for them to understand and they seemed to enjoy playing.  However. they only played with it one time.  It's been a few weeks since they got it and they haven't gotten it out again.  This isn't typical of them since they enjoy playing games.  So. I assume that they didn't find it all that enjoyable.If you or your loved one is an avid fan of Rudolph. it might be worth purchasing.  If you are only a passing fan. then you may not get much pleasure from this game."
7,"I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake. but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps. but again. the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star. but I can't find a reason to even go for two."
11,"This book has always been a favorite in our household with our two daughters (now ages 3 and 6). They both grew up with this book and it made for a great introduction to numbers and counting. The book consists of little plastic monkey faces showing through holes in each page. As you turn each page. one face stays back on the previous page so that the count of monkeys goes down. The story flows with the decrease in monkey faces as they monkeys do something silly that they aren't supposed to do and fall off the bed... until there are none left. My 3 year old still chooses this book pretty regularly for her bedtime story even though she already knows her counting. She thinks it's a funny story and we regularly tell them to 'stop messing around on the beds so they don't fall off and bump their heads.' It is a great introduction to counting for your little ones. Highly Recommended!"
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
9,"I mounted this on my Henry lever action .22.  It fits the Henry. which is pre-grooved for rings. very nicely.  I didn't have to get new rings nor take off the iron sights. which was a big plus for me.I am not an expert on glasses so I won't (and can't) get too technical.  Lens very clear at all magnifications.  I was a little surprised nothing was included for 'clicking' the elevation/windage. but my pocket knife did the trick quite nicely anyway.  My local indoor range only goes to 50 yards and it took me about maybe 15 minutes to get it sighted in pretty close to what I wanted.  I was shooting dime sized 5-shot patterns in no time (from a sitting position. haven't done prone or off-hand yet).All in all. I doubt you can find a better bargain on Amazon than this guy if you need a cheap yet efficient rimfire scope.  100% recommended."
12,"I have always been a FF fan ever since 2 was out. I've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this. Let me tell you about the game:As you have probably found out from other reviews. it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc.. who is polluting the Earth. One of these members is a man named Cloud. a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier. which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles. they proved to be a challenge. Cloud. Sid. and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time. Espeically the 11 minute ending. Man that was good. ENJOY!"
11,"I bought this game for my 4 year old for his birthday.  We played it shortly after his birthday and he needed a little help when it was his turn.  He got a little frustrated the first time we played because he wanted to do it all by himself.  After playing this game a handful of times he needs very little help now.The game is fun for the adults in the house too.  It reminds me a little of dominos because you have to match future pieces with pieces previously played.  I think it is a little easier to play than dominos because there is a little less strategy involved.  However. it is still a super fun game.  I would recommend this game for a bright 4 year old. but be prepared to provide a little assistance.  A typical 5 or 6 year old should be able to play this game with little to no help.  This is a fun family game that everyone can play and enjoy!"
4,"Yes. it is I. the Edit Avenger!!Here to protect freedom and original art from plunderous corporations and soulless individuals!!!!If you are considering purchasing a 2004 or later release of 'Rudolph'. think twice. It is edited.I just ordered the original 2002 UNEDITED/no Destiny's Child 'Rudolph' DVD from eBay express. I got it sealed for $6.99 + $3 shipping.Do NOT buy edited DVDs when you can avoid it. Let's send the message. If you don't think that you make a difference remember this:Consumer complaints about the edits in 'Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge Collection Vol 1' were 100% of the reason that volumes 2 and 3 were released with absolutely NO edits whatsoever to the material.Good for us!Edits are for losers!I have spoken."
3,"Although this isn't the usual kind of read I expect when I think of Kallysten it's definitely got her touch.  I'm used to more erotic vs. sensual romance although this story lacks in the erotic it doesn't lack for emotion or conflict.Kate is an extremely strong female. Marc is a Vampire and Blake is his Childe.  The three make for amazing chemistry and witty banter.  From first meeting there is a spark and although Kate is put off by Blake's cocky attitude she's extremely intrigued by Marc and his relationship with Blake.  Kate has lived as a soldier for quite some time. she's bonded as a warrior with her fellow teammates. Marc and Blake bring the woman back out in her.  They all give one another a different perspective on why their fighting and exactly what their fighting for.I enjoyed this book and will definitely be finishing the trilogy. I can't wait to find out more about these characters."
9,"Dr. Bronner's Rose Castile Soap is really great stuff - while we haven't used it on our laundry for house cleaning purposes. we have used it for all sorts of personal care cleaning purposes. including to use to wash our hair. faces. and bodies.  I'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo. as it's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it's rosy scent. however. it's really nice to use as a face and body wash.  As a shampoo. it tends to dry out my hair a little too much. also.  As a face and body wash. I haven't noticed any effects of drying out my skin. and the scent is not strong enough to overpower. but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented.  The scent is not chemically or super girly smelling - my husband even likes using this soap!  Highly recommended."
11,"This is a very subjective review.The game system is pretty much the same as all the other Munchkin games.  Get to level 10. get the treasure. stab your buddy etc...The only reason for the lower than usual review is I'm not enamored with the genre. sort of like Munchkin bites. it's just not my kind of theme.  If outer space antics are your style then you will enjoy this game much more than I did.My son has Every verison of Munchkin (except blender) and this and Munchkin bites are the two I pass up whenever possible.The game likely deserves another star but I just don't enjoy it enough to give it."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
4,"Excellent film has many gripping and brilliantly realized scenes throughout.  I am sure many people are going to be divided about this film although I do not believe that it is anti-semitic in the slightest.  It will be very violent to some.  I thought that Gibson directed the film amazingly.  The acting by Jim Caviezel is astonishing.  Well shot cinematography and musical score.  But I can't say that it is the best religious film I have ever seen.  That title still belongs to 'Ben Hur'."
9,"Got this case for a projector I received that didn't come with its own case.  Pelican products are always very high quality and backed by a full warranty.  I received the case quickly and it was perfect for my needs.  The pluck and pull foam insert is very easy to use to make a custom fit for your equipment.  Took me less than 10 minutes to make separate cutouts for the projector. the cord and the remote.  (Useful tip - purchase a container of desiccant if you are going to store electronics or other sensitive equipment in this to absorb any moisture)"
8,"These are perfect for stuffing toys. like kongs and other types with smaller holes.I put round and square ones into my Aussie's large regularly shaped kong. and the biscuit-looking ones into my rat terrier's stuffable chew toys. She doesn't get the regularly shaped kong. because her jaw is smaller than the kong's opening. so she fishes the cookies out very easily. She gets other toys (from Petsmart) which are very tough as well. but have smaller openings. like KONG Stuff-A-Ball. It takes her over 20 minutes to get them out.  These cookies are much harder than regular biscuits. It takes her 5 minutes to get the regular biscuits and snaps out of any toy.my rat terrier is a very powerful chewer..."
7,"First of all. this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of. I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so. and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models. but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
3,"The events of 'Ylesia' take place during 'Destiny's Way.'  If you've read 'Destiny's Way.' you will see it mentioned in passing.Jaina and Jacen go to Ylesia to fight the Peace Brigade to show them that it's not good to align themselves with the enemy.  From there. it is page after page of battle scenes.  It is endless.  One huge chapter.  It's like the chapter that was cut out for good reason.'Ylesia' doesn't advance 'Destiny's Way' or 'The New Jedi Order' in any way that I could tell.  We don't learn anything new.  There is no insight.  If I had skipped it. I wouldn't have missed anything.If you don't mind reading in PDF. 'Ylesia' is available free from Del Rey.  If you Google. you'll see it linked to the Wayback machine and it's still there."
11,"This is a fun family game for Simpsons fans. It is more fun that other Scene It games I have played and was more enjoyable for the whole family. This is a good value since it's the Deluxe version for the same price as some stores sell the regular version. Some of the trivia questions are hard. but everyone has a chance to do well since many of the questions are based only on observations from the clips that are shown. This would be a great addition to a family game night collection as well as a welcome gift for a fan of The Simpsons."
7,"This product works as advertised. my tomatoes are doing very well.  However. it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered.  You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it.  I was having problems with it drying out quickly (granted. I live in New Mexico. where it is quite dry) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil.  I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top.  I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day.  The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom. dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs.  I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"I got this at a neighbor's recommendation and I am glad I did.  I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight.  This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste.  I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg. which deer and small rodents apparently don't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell. it is not overpowering and it does do the job.  This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a  motorized pupmp that runs on batteries.  It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray.  I would certainly recommend this.  It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
7,"I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook."
9,"This thing GOES.We get our best results from a determined onslaught to bend the ring DOWN on both sides. like a taco.  Hold it in place for a minute. and then the ring gets great lift and is easier to aim.  The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.This is great to keep in the car.  For my littlest son. we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close.  For bigger kids. they have plenty of time to run into position for cathcing the disk -- this thing floats for a long time.Watch out for trees.  And I guarantee you it will sail out of a normal suburban yard. so watch for cars. too."
8,"My family adopted a Golden Retriever who loves to fetch.  Problem is she's a slobbery mess. and I hated touching the balls.  I also can't throw very far when compared to how fast she runs. so games were short. and she wasn't exercising her full potential.Not any more!  I can probably throw the ball 250 feet now. and my dog is huffing and puffing in a few minutes!  I usually play with two balls. one she is fetching. and the other is ready to go when she comes back.  She wasn't very fond of the tennis ball that comes with the launcher. however I ordered some of the orange chuck-it balls and she's doing well with those.  You'll definitely need a large open area to use this though!Definitely worth the money."
2,"This is a great cordless vac. I have two dogs and this picks up all the hair without getting clogged! (works great on floors- medium success with carpet so if you have carpet this may not be your solution). I have an Electrolux that was specifically advertised to be good for people with dogs- what a waste of money- it clogs with the first pass- don't make the same mistake.  The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job.  It's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all."
9,"I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set based on the positive reviews I've read here on the product and the customer service. Fortunately I have not had to use the customer service. But the product is as advertised. I wanted to hold off on writing the review until I got to use the bands for a little while. I have been using it for my P90X workouts along with dumbbells and it has performed flawlessly. The quality of the bands are excellent and when you think about the cost it is a real bargain. Rarely does a product exceed my expectations but this one has. I highly recommend these bands."
7,"Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass. but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block."
5,"Dava picks are one of life's guilty little pleasures. They may seem pricey for picks. but they're still not that expensive. I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all gone.I use these to play slide. I also have Fender and Musician's Friend picks. but those are just the standard flat stamped-out pieces of plastic. The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control. And they just plain feel good to use. The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide. but with Dava you get a great grip."
2,"I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever.  However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough. but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to 'save money' and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings."
5,"This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized; at least you can have one place where you can find a pick. as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case. but a small baggie will work just as well. Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage? Sometimes (depending on the amount and size of the pick) it's hard to get the pick out of the holder. and if you use something other than the standard shape. forget it.  It has an adhesive backing. so I guess you can stick it on your amp/guitar/wall/small animal. but I'd rather not."
7,"I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days.  I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there. with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it. and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter. with a black. rich compost all around.Now mind you. I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot. dry heat this time of year.  I don't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July. By then this compost will be ready.  I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes.  I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly.  The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled.  Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff.  And that is a good sign."
3,"I had never read any of the old Classics so I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews.  It did start a little slow. but at the same time intriguing with the mystery of where the bullet came from.  At times I could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of the characters. and found it very interesting how they created things we take for granted today.  It's hard to remember that people used to have to do everything for themselves. it sure has been a lost art in the western society! I found the writing wonderful and Jules Verne painted wonderful details which made the story itself such a pleasure to read!"
3,"Okay so this book literally goes one paragraph in the present. then a flashback. present for a bit. flashback. It was so annoying. I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE. you are MARRIED. you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him. It was just a pathetic excuse for a book and really. writing in general."
3,"I've always like the Reader's Digest for a good blend of writing from humor to drama. having subscribed to the print version a number of times off and on over the years.  The actual content quality has always remained consistently high for this publication.It does seem the print version has become overloaded with ads. but that was less of a problem than the annoying cardboard insert/tear-out ads that make the thing physically difficult to read.The Kindle version is a very much improved experience over the print version. with the same high quality writing. of course.  A bonus is that the linked navigation makes it really easy to find an article for the mood I'm in at a given moment."
8,"For some odd reason I thought these were chewable. which clearly they're not. I'm not exactly how sure the dental part works in. I haven't noticed better breath or less tarter. It's a hard plastic toy. luckily for me my dog knows better than to eat the pieces she chews off. she just spits them out. If your dog isnt that way I wouldnt recommend as it could do inner damage or atleast monitor your dog. Im giving the product 4 stars because it did arrive earlier than expected. it does keep my dog entertained. shes more interested in chewing this toy than furniture. She seems happy with it so im happy."
8,"I thought this would be a little bigger. but that's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now. and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized. This is a great size for small-medium Dogs. It's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away! Haha. It's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers! As with any hard chew toy. do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they don't hurt a tooth. Ive heard that this can be a problem."
9,"Sorry. I'm just not a fan.  This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes. but I just couldn't get the hang of it with knives.  The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle.  The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you're trying to sharpen. rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks.  I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result."
2,"Needed a small. light duty. vacuum for our store.  After checking various reviews. purchased this item from Amazon.  It is compact. lightweight. has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag. which I prefer.  It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.  We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.  Three minor. non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism.  But. the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.  I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.  All. in all. this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive. convenient vacuum."
7,"This may look like a gimmick to you but it's not.  This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables.  All you need is a sunny place to hang it.  If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space. try this.  They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter.  Last summer I grew tomatoes. bell peppers and cucumbers in them.  I believe it needs to contain more soil (larger) to be an ideal tomato planter.  It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better.  One trick to know (not applicable for tomatoes)- take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy-- one in the top and one in the bottom."
7,"No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower can't reach. I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post. the street lamp post on my property. the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable. the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower can't handle.These shears are lightweight. are easy to use. cut the grass cleanly and. best of all. they let me stand up while using them. They do not require a battery. power cord. string or anything else besides a hand. Very handy. very useful and very good."
2,"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame. but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight."
2,"I bought this to clean up the bits of cat litter my cat tracks onto the bathroom floor  when he jumps out of his litter box.  For this it works stupendously.  I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held. but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power. and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus. tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time."
8,"WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing"
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
9,"This parachute is a lot of fun!  Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it. but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down.  He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction.This one is bigger than I thought it would be. which is a good thing. but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home.  If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around.  But if you have only 3 people to play with. while it still works. it's more fun with more people.  But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be!Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids!"
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
8,"I've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well. In fact. I purchased one for my mother's pets. I'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year. the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick. The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often. I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price. especially if you have to replace them more often. Check out the filters here on Amazon. you'll see I'm not the only one dissatisfied. Because of this. I am switching over to the Drinkwell system. I've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
7,"We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However. my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them. leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard."
7,"As soon as you put this in your hand you will kick yourself for not having bought it sooner.  Like many. I bought $1. $5. $7 nozzles that lasted all of one season.  They are just cheap junk.  We forget about how often we replace them because they are cheap at the time.  This particular model is their heavy duty. which should last though hot summers and cold winters.  It has brass components. a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions.  It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use.  A small depression of the handle gives you a gentle fan while a full depression gives you a powerful stream.  Compare this one with that cheapo you have now and you will clearly see the difference.  It is certainly money well spent."
12,"I would say the gameboy color was the best hand held game system I ever owned or play. Something that you grew up using will stick to you forever. I still play my gameboy evey now and then. playing games that never get old like pokemon. The only thing I ever had bad to say about the gameboy color was that it does not have a back light and I have to use a worm light. If you ever owned a gameboy in your life it's something that you always keep with you or end up buying another one like me."
8,"Frontline Plus is the only product I've used until present when we started using a multi-purpose Heart worm topical that includes some tic and flea protection.  Seems one still needs Frontline type protection anyway..Consider getting a syringe and small container (available on web) and splitting larger does Frontline over two or more applications.  I'd not be comfortable using one so large that it took more than two or three months to use it all - and keep the unused portion in a cool/dark place I have been told."
9,"I discovered Dr. Bronner's soap pin my local food co-op when I was a student- more years ago than I care to admit. I can only echo what others say: It's the perfect all around hand soap. bath soap and dish soap. I buy it in gallon jugs. attach a pump (available at any good hardware store) and transfer it into quart containers for the bath. pint containers for travel. and hand dispensers for the bathroom and kitchen sink. A gallon lasts close to a year in my household- just remember. as the Doctor says: Dilute! Dilute! Dilute! ;-)"
3,"I give it five stars.Unbreakable by Sydney Somers is a fantastic action filled story. in the tradition of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that I found almost impossible to put down. The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future. Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper. If you love stories about demons. heroes. hot sex and a great love that won't be denied then you are sure to love Unbreakable."
7,"I have a non-heavy-duty version of this hose. which has worked well for me for a year or so now. and I wanted another NeverKink. because these hoses seem to be flexible and easy to coil by hand. yet able to keep water flowing.This hose is quite a bit more rigid/inflexible than standard garden hoses and other NeverKink hoses. which makes winding the hose onto a hanger a little more difficult. and handling the hose a little more difficult in general. The hose does seem like it will stand up to a lot of use. though.My only major gripe is that the female end of the hose seems to have developed a leak already. after only a few weeks' use. seemingly at the point where the hose is crimped onto the brass fitting. I'll probably buy a replacement female connection from the home center and put it on."
11,"I got this game and tried it out on my family. They immediately loved it. even the family members who I'm usually hard-pressed to get to play. I bought most of the expansions that go with it that increase it from a max of 6 to 8 players. The game mechanics are very simple to teach. You will never play the same game twice with all the alien races you can be in the game and each of their own skills and abilities really change the strategy and game play of each game you play. I can't say enough good things about this game and I highly recommend it to anyone! This game has been around a long time and its gotten better with age seems like."
12,"DO not get me wrong.  I am one of The BIGGEST Zelda fans in the world. and I bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and  all.But this Just isn't a Zelda game....Its missing the Fancy tunes.  the story just doesn't seem that addictive.WHen you first get the game  its great and it looks to be one of the best games. but then after you beat  it.... its kinda boring...Zelda games should never get boring! Zelda NES  I STILL paly that damn game.' Link Not as good as the first but still I  like playing it. Zelda A Link To the pass on SNES is the BEST Zelda game.I just cannot love this game.. it did horrorble for a Zelda game."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"Ticket to Ride is a game my family and I have been able to play over and over and over again.  It's one of the best new games I've played in years.  I have the game. expansions and even the iPad version.  The classic physical board game is still my favorite with friends. but the digital version allows you to play against an AI pretty easily with no change in gameplay.If you know a computer scientist. math major or engineer. they will find the mathematical puzzle of solving the &#34;Shortest Path&#34; problem fascinating.A great gift for a friend or your family."
3,"This is it. the big kahuna of newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles. no emailing articles to a friend. no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So. if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
12,"My nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii. Once I purchased the game for him. we found out that the Wii controllers won't work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii. After doing a little research. I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card. Once we got both of those. the gamecube game that we bought finally worked! After playing the game for a bit while being &#34;tethered&#34; to the Wii system because of the cable for the controller. we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom. So we got these controller extension cables. He is happy!"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
5,"I've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. I've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to. Would recommend to any level of guitar player!"
8,"I have 2 Dachshunds and a cat and this fountain is perfect. Purchased a different fountain and it stopped working after a few days. This fountain got great reviews. that's the reason why I got it and I'm very pleased with it. My pets have no trouble drinking out of it and they have fresh water all of the time. I do empty the water out and wash the bowl twice a week to get out the junk that the dogs' leave from drinking. which I would do with any bowl. Other than that. I'm sold!"
7,"When I first opened the package. I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece. this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest. so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on. I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again. although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks."
9,"I compared this to a standard whistle (the ones with the &#34;pea&#34; inside).  This is louder. so in an emergency. this can be heard from farther away.  However. it takes a lot more air to blow it.  Therefore. if an emergency includes you being injured or weakened in some way. you might not get much sound out of it.My suggestion is to have one of these. but also have the traditional (easier to blow) whistle in your pack or emergency bag.  If you have the energy to blow this. do so. if you can only blow the other one. even though it isn't as loud. it may still save your life."
7,"I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22. 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
3,"I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself. I find they are an easy read; that is. beautifully written. engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous. not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact. many are free!!"
4,"As someone who has read a few books about the physical suffering Jesus went through. I was amazed at how real the physical events were portrayed in this movie; almost like Mel Gibson took a time machine and filmed the crucifixion as it took place.  Now if we could only build a time machine to send the critics back in time.Even non-JesusFreaks should admit this movie was filmed to perfection.Every actor was great.  Every scene captivating.  Every word. needed.  Not only was this a great movie. it is fact.  The most real FACT there has ever been.  The man (God) on that cross took those nails for all of us...even those that dare reject His sacrifice.  Buy this movie and share it with friends - believers and non-believers.God Bless!(...)"
8,"I found two young female cats wondering around my neighborhood and eventually caught them. their fur was rough and dirty from malnourishment and the harsh weather. After a bath and some good science diet cat food. they're as healthy as can be! Their fur is soft and their teeth are so healthy! I also leave a bowl of science diet cat food for the other two feral cats that don't want to be caught. I will not be taking my two new kitty cats off this food. they love it to much!"
3,"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to 'show' him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much."
8,"Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami. Florida. We have exterminated the yard. his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar.  We also used Rose Geranium oil. all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem.  Adult ticks and baby ticks.  It's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day."
5,"I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it's EQ. Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to &#34;bassy&#34;. and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little. I really didn't expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. If you're looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar. I'd recommend this."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
8,"I bought this product to supplement my Siberian husky&#8217;s home cooked diet that is supplemented with high quality kibble.  We have been adding Nupro to her 3 daily meals for nearly 2 months now and her coat is noticeably smoother & shinier.  Previously she had hotspots around her mouth from licking; Nupro has almost totally alleviated this.  Shockingly. she turned the powder down at first (we have read reviews that said dogs couldn&#8217;t refuse the smell/flavors) but now we mix the powder with water and top it onto her food and she can&#8217;t get enough.  This is a great product for anyone looking for a top quality dog food supplement."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
12,"Tomb Raider 3 is the hardest of the Tomb Raider series (at least in my opinion). It has a very complicated plot. decent graphics. and a moderate amount of action--although I have not completed it myself. It could use more action and less puzzles. however. The biggest problem with it that I've faced is that it has a lot of bugs and errors throughout. Some errors can be fixed without a lot of hassle. others can be fixed but with a lot of hassle. and some can't be fixed at all. Myself. I don't have a lot of patience. I just play the game because I love challenges. So. unless you have a LOT of patience. or enjoy tough challenges like I do. TR3 is not for you."
2,"This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff. and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife. wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives. you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest. least-attractive lemon twists ever. and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK. it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane. or maybe a different zester. but this one is a turd. Finally. the handle is not 'comfortable.' it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy."
11,"This is a fun game for players of all ages.  The board depicts a map of the United States (in this version; other versions exist for other locations) with train routes of appropriate lengths between major cities.  Players have tickets from one major city to another.  In order to get credit for that ticket. the player must build their train between those cities.  Combine routes to get points for more tickets.The game requires logic in that you need to plan your route appropriately; longer legs earn greater point values.A good time is had by all!"
2,"Bought for 3rd time in November 2012.  Due to misadventures in moving we have had to buy this exact product 3 times.  The grip stays in hand with no slipping even if hand gets wet while using.  Peels excellent with little pressure.  My gal friend has rheumatoid arthritis and this is the only style she can use.  Got stupid once and bought the Kitchen Aid red colored one just because of the color and regretted on 1st use - handle was uncomfortable. slippery. and blades would not peel properly.  The OXO is easy to use. easy to clean. very reliable product and company.  Amazon price slightly better than any other store we researched."
9,"I have a philosophy about my new commuting experience that can be summed up as visibility trumps cool.  If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night (I guess folks do that) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light.  Essentially. this will do.  The Bell light makes light and flashes.  I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road.  It is fairly cheap construction. but it shouldn't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work.  The light is inexpensive and it works.  If you are concerned with batteries and the environment. buy a generator light... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one."
8,"I didn't get what picture and ingredients showed.  So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog's treats.  They didn't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change. Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change.  So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed.  I may buy them again. I don't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good. My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them.  review from 2 stars to 5 stars."
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
9,"The knife itself is well made and comes nice and sharp out of the box. My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full-tang knife. and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt. The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it (the nylon model with the integrated multi-tool pouch) isn't really that great in my opinion. It's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi-tool there. but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it. so to each their own.That said. I have no qualms about my purchase and it's a solid. well-built knife that I anticipate will last me quite some time."
8,"I have been very happy with my Snuggle Safe heat pad. The claims of 10-12 hours of heat are true IF you insulate it a bit. OK. it cools off in 4 hours or so if you leave it sitting out. but under a blanket. it stays toasty for a good 10 hours (I don't think I have every checked it after 12 hours. but I expect it would still be a bit warm).Granted. my cats are not much interested (maybe they will be when the weather gets cold again). but I love it. I stick it at the foot of the bed (under the covers. so it stays warm). or even just hold it while I am reading in the evening.  I also got one for my Mom. who has Reynaud's Syndrome. and she says it is great. She just keeps it nearby and warms her hands as needed."
2,"The day I got this peeler. I compared how it peeled side by side with my other swivel potato peeler. just like an infomercial. or something. The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible. It takes no time at all to peel a potato. whereas I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before! I'm surprised that most swivel potato peelers don't have any kind of grip on the handle. because after any length of time. holding it can definitely be hard on your hand. It peels carrots equally well. and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun."
7,"I used this in Vietnam. where the local butcher. Hang Kau Pung. asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it. we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals."
1,"After reading the reviews. and recognizing the quality of OXO. I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease. and with this superb brush. the soap scum is gone. Good grief. what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow. coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush. which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip. wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces. from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14"
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
11,"Our weekly DnD group had a set-back tonight. so we grabbed a copy of this from the local Target store as a stand-in.  All of our guys were quite entertained by this game. and it served as a great temporary stand-in for a sorely missed DnD session.  I would highly rate this for a gaming group looking for an engaging and fun distraction.  The variety in the play of this game is excellent. and while it's easy to grasp. it isn't easy to win...especially with a group of gamer's that will 'stick it to you'. The backstabbing is quite fun. and most gamers would get a kick out of the humor.  Overall. a definite thumbs up for gamers out there!"
1,"I am the dishwasher in my home. and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush. and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one. and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well. is easy to keep from getting clogged. and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all. and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference."
9,"Yes D batteries can be expensive. but my name brand batteries seem to last a long time. Plus the ability to take it anywhere is a BIG plus. My pump works just great on the 4 in 1 Coleman mattress. Inflated both in under 2 minutes. Deflation even faster. Remember. sometimes you get a dud. try again. I got lucky and got a great pump at a great price. I have tried those aero type beds. and not for me. Uncomfortable. heavy. must have a plug near by to inflate. I'm spur of the moment. so this travel pump is just perfect! p.s. it's advertised as a 4D pump. so you know before you buy it takes D batteries. so if you don't want the weight by a bike pump!!"
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
1,"I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG. for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright."
8,"I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also. the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading. which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro. the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
8,"I recieved this fountain in the mail approximately 2 weeks. ago. so I will enter a new review later if my opinion changes...That said. this is a great fountain so far.  Fairly easy to assemble. extremely quiet (almost silent). and very easy to refill...you can leave it running. remove the water container. refill and replace without having to turn the unit off.That said. it is not the petmate 'deluxe' model..no in-line power switch. no flow adjustment valve... so. don't buy this if you are looking for those features.Only time will tell if the pump continues to work as silently and as quietly as it has so far. but as of now. this is a good purchase for the money...given the mistake in labeling it as 'deluxe'.  It is still at least $10.00 cheaper than the same model at my local pet chain store."
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
2,"I had never used a pressure cooker before but have been planning to buy one for a while. and decided to buy this one because it looks well made and has good reviews.I tried cooking several vegetables and some Sirloin tips (separately) and found the Sirloin surprisingly tender. the vegetables retained a lot more flavor.I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver. resulting in great tasting food!"
4,"Shiva Damienson has got it all wrong.  Every other movie about the New Testamont has been inacurate in their dipiction of Christ's crusifixtion.  If you've seen movies like Jesus of Nazereth and others from that era. than your eyes will be opened when you see this film.  If you consider the film to be overly violent than stay away from it. even if you are a Christian like me.  I am a Christian and was disturbed by the violence. but that was because it was commited against my savior: an inoccent man.  The movie is rated R for a reason. so this movie is not appropriate for a younger audience. but for anyone who has the stomach to handle it. than see it."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
12,"I was never a big fan of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre. but after giving Half-Life a try (thanks to all of the glimmering reviews). I am absolutely hooked. From the opening tram sequence. you're mesmerized by  Gordon Freeman's plight and the falling Black Mesa world surrounding him.  It's a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of  sunlight (apologies to my wife!). After dishing out punishment to those  Marines. be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes.  The fun gets even better. and the taste of death is even sweeter when you  blow apart that guy with 196 kills. Half-Life is truly a work of art.  Opposing Forces. here I come."
8,"I've had two of these fountains. and several family members also have them.  Yes. weird things happen. and at least one was returned to company with pump problems.  For whatever reason. they do not include the following information routinely in their packaging.  For a pdf that illustrates routine cleaning. and some FAQ's. go to: [...]  You need to take the pump apart and despite the instructions in pdf. use the pointed type q-tips. a wire cake tester. in-between-teeth cleaner brush(really). you get the idea. to clean it inside and out! My cats love this fountain. but we joke that one of them has a 'drinking problem.' because she likes to belly-up at front of fountain and drink from waterfall. resulting in a drenched bib.  The pdf should address many of the common complaints about this product.  Good luck!"
2,"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However. I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
9,"This is a beautifully constructed. solid tool. Being so it is on the heavy side. The only faults that I find with it are: the phillips head screwdriver blade is hard to remove and there are three slot head screwdriver blades. In this day and age it is rare to find a slot headed screw and rarer still to need three different blades. On the other hand. the one phillips headed screw driver is of an in-between size (size 1?). a larger or smaller one would be more useful. I have found that it works fairly well with larger Phillips head screws.The locking mechanism for the blades is positive and easy to remove.I agree that the snap closure on the holster is inadequate.If the combination that includes three flat screw driver blades works for you then this tool is nearly perfect."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
9,"I've taken this to work. outside. to the beach etc.  I can't get enough of this thing!  When it starts getting boring I put it away for a week or two then shoot the dog with it.  Since he can't see it coming he things something just jumped in front or above him!  I even hit my mother in law several times and she had no idea the &#34;thump&#34; was what was causing her hair to jump!!!!!  This is even fun for my 4 year old. she can pull it back enough to get a nice air slug out even though she can't pull it back all the way and still aim.  Great fun!!!!!!!!!!"
9,"I spent quite some time researching and trying to find a pocket knife that I liked that was made in the USA.  Unfortunately the information about that is very sketchy online.  This one doesn't say it anywhere. so I took a chance and got lucky that it had the Portland. OR stamp on the blade.  I have been using it for several months now and have absolutely no complaints about it.  I love the cut outs on the blade for one handed opening vs. the typical thumb posts.  It fits in my pocket very well and was extremely well sharpened when it arrived."
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
6,"What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain. cylindrical body. a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap. and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests. but they do put ink on paper. and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that. these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat."
3,"This was a fast paced tale.  It started off so innocently in the Holy Land with a pleasant trip with just a hint of something wrong.  Greg's  senses were picking up little nuances. but couldn't quite put a finger on what was bothering him.  Just too many coincidences.  After they got home. the fun started.  With Jill kidnapped he had to pull out all the stops and call in every favor he could.  As this is the beginning of the series. it made you think a little harder.  Loved the relationship and the genuine love between them.  A great read.  Recommend reading all this series."
4,"I started kickboxing with this video. only to find it too challenging.  Though Kathy instructs you on careful and precise movements and good posture. you are really better off going to a class first where someone not  only instructs you but checks that you are doing the moves correctly.  However. after learning how to do the moves correctly. this video is  excellent. though occasionally repetitive.  Kathy and her friend can be a  little bit annoying. but once you break a sweat. they are the last thing  you're thinking about!"
2,"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock. and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all. but I've really been craving sorbet. and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix. but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours. only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."
12,"This game had the potential to be great. but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with. as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game. If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games. or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations. than you just may be good to go. but you can easily take a lot of damage. and you can't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games. or Quake. If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you. then go ahead and play this. but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements. I think you are better off playing Doom 3. Silent Hill. the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3.These are my two cents."
1,"I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way.  I wasn't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed. but it sounded like the newer the scar is. the better it works.  Honestly. I've been using it for a few weeks (I try for once a day. but I occasionally forget) and the results are AMAZING.  It literally looks better every day.  The weird bump &#34;over scarring&#34; areas were gone after TWO days.  Now my scar had JUST healed.  I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone. so I suspect that's why I've had such great luck."
7,"It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring. including wasting three of the 'clean out' cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product."
8,"My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every 'durable' toy there is.  I got her the 'wolf' size Galileo and had to help her start it (it's slippery before they scratch it up) but now she loves it.  If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you!  It doesn't even seem to matter that it's not flavored (at least not to my knowledge).  I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones."
7,"Though I have several string trimmers. there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines. I'll be in big trouble. and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well. and though I only use them a few times a year. they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely."
2,"This coffee maker makes good coffee. but all the little parts. which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months. I couldn't get it out. even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off. when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also 'beeps' at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee. but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement."
4,"Well. the title explains it. The title is extremely pointless. Why? Why? Why? Why did Toho have to make such a stupid film???! There are some changes they should have made. First. aliens. Why aliens? It is waaaay to corny. Second. Ghidrah. Way did Toho make Ghidrah look like he was a drunken elf? Ghidrah didn't have to shake his legs. heads. and wings uncontrolably! And third. MAKE GODZILLA AND THE OTHER MONSTERS GOOD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've given this movie five stars if Godzilla wasn't good! That mistake made the rest of the Showa series dumb. In the later movies. Godzilla acts more like Barney than a giant monster."
1,"While there is nothing wrong with the product. I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages. I am not blaming the retailers. I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be &#34;eliminating&#34; competing generic offerings. especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents. That's $0.88! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid. but there was no better generic offerings. it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless. I don't have a &#34;good reason&#34; to return these (oh. I would. if I could. but it's not the seller's fault. so I don't want to make them take losses on S&H;). but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now."
7,"I sure do love having this set in my shed.  I've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively.  I've never used the hedge trimmer. so I can't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries. which is super handy for heavy work days.  The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time. Bonus.* Lightweight.  I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn.* A wall mount with hooks comes with the set. So. I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed. just like in the photo.* Durable. good B&D; quality.The only bummer I've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly.  So. don't dawdle when using the leaf blower."
3,"This is not my first time reading this collection. I have the paperback copies that I have kept over the years. It is a totally engrossing set of books. Maggie Shayne is one of my favorite paranormal authors. one that I can be sure when I pick up one of her books. I will enjoy it.Wings in the Night. Part 1 contains six wonderful tales about the creatures of the night known as vampires. I read that Maggie's line of vampire stories are the original ones. the ones that came before. You will see they are people just like you and me. You'll fall in love at least once. Maybe more.If you like paranormal romance. get this collection. You won't be disappointed. All I was disappointed in was that I couldn't give it more than five stars. I am looking forward to obtaining more of her books for the Kindle or Nook."
7,"I like the fact that Deer Off is all-natural or I wouldn't have used it.  It comes with a battery-operated sprayer that works fairly well and delivers a good stream.  I walked twice around my garden while spraying a steady stream of Deer off around the perimeter.  The sprayer should be flushed out with clean water after each use.The odor around my garden wasn't unpleasant to me.  An application is supposed to last for 90 days but long before 90 days I saw rabbits in the garden.  On the plus side I haven't seen any signs of deer in the garden. and they potentially eat a lot more than rabbits.So it's effectiveness is inconclusive but at least it doesn't hurt to try."
12,"Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man. are you guys even trying anymore?  I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh. you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics. horrible gameplay. sucky battle system. hard to understand. VERY difficult to get into it. too confusing. dumbxxx characters like cloud. hes the worst.(except sephiroth). sometimes too long of cutscenes. boring cutscenes. you can barely see their eyes &amp; mouth. etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million.I hate this game."
2,"This little Eureka vac works well for me to pick up cat litter. crumbs. and easily tackles quick clean ups on the hard surface floors around my home. It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces; I've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time. On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards. I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go. I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space. The beater brush setting can be on on or off. The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum. Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet."
9,"Speedo makes great goggles with great quality.  I usually buy a pair every year or two to replace older ones that I have scratched up and or stretched out...yes I have a big head.  :-)That said I figure I would try a pair of these.  True to form. they are perfect goggles and very high quality.  Not much else can be said.I rate them 5/5 but with a hint of CAUTION!If you are ok with wearing what seems like a pair of sunglasses under water..then these are for you.  They do in fact block sunlight and make the experience a bit better during the bright mid afternoon but they do darken things up quite a bit  Just a note....in the end its your choice."
7,"This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs. chicken. sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood. but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the 'best ribs in the universe' procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around."
4,"This movie will make you laugh til you cry. it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie. thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout. not breathing any life into the role.Other than that. loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!"
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
6,"Those of us who've used a i950 don't need to be told that they drink ink like... I don't know... like how a thirsty something drinks water. In my case. this has been a good incentive to think twice before I go to print anything. Now. this set is a true price break from what I was used to. I don't really need an 8-pack but I did get one once. by mistake and I had no problem with the i950. I just ended up with 2 extra cartridges.It's low price. free shipping... if this was a grocery item. I'd probably set it up as an Amazon subscription. If anyone is aware of a better deal anywhere - it's got to be genuine Canon ink - please leave a comment to this review and I will be more than grateful."
3,"Novella length urban fantasy along the lines of Butcher's Dresden.I like this authors style. It has such a devil may care attitude to it and that is exactly how he has written his main character. With the debonnaire flair of  an outcast gentleman and the sarcastic wit of a person who doesn't give a flying monkey what anyone says or thinks.A few minor errors. one being the use of the word reign instead of reins.Other than that this is quite an excellent read. just a shame it isn't a full length novel. Saying that though novellas often feel 'interrupted' for wont of a better word and this doesn't. it fits snugly and ends well. Like the first cup of coffee in the morning.It just feels right.AVP-UK"
9,"The AirZooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The AirZooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own. but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!"
11,"Without repeating what has already been said in other reviews. I simply want to add to the advice that this game is for hardcore Simpsons fans.  I thought I was one...until I played this game.  I have watched the Simpsons since the early 90's and have seen most episodes at least 4-5 times.  This game was still very difficult for me. I thought that I would be able to play it with my kids (10 and 5) who watch the Simpsons with me. but it was really to difficult for them. However. I enjoyed watching the clips and it's a great collectible for serious fans.  I also got it for a fantastic price on Amazon. so no regrets!"
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"For players who like a meaty game. Talisman will give you hours of fun time. A typical game can last over two hours and the rules are more complicated than Monopoly but it isn't hard to master. For a modest investment in learning the game. you can have many afternoons and evenings of fun with kids age 10 and up. great for adults getting together for a game night as well. We play with all adults. mixed kids and adults. and all games are fun.The large number of cards and races make for varied reply and the available expansions are well worth addeding for new races. cards and regions. There is a random component to the game but the focus is more on steady advancement of your character which favors good play over luck.For those who play RPGs. this game could be considered 'D&D; lite'. a good way to get a fantasy gaming fix in when you can't get your regular group together.Materials are sturdy and the game holds up to lots of use."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
11,"This ship is probably one of the most important ships for the rebel side in the game. and almost all competitive rebel squadron lists have at least one. in fact the world champion used two X-wings and two B-wings. It does come in the Core Set bu this expansion has some very nice cards that add to the lethality of the X-wing. Mostly the usefulness is the two named pilots Wedge and Garvin. both are good with Wedge being the more useful of the two. The upgrades are decent with the highlights being the Astromechs.Whether it comes from this expansion. the Core Set. or the Rebel Transport the X-wing is a good ship. but all come with the different pilots that make it a great ship and I recommend picking up this expansion especially if you want to fly rebels."
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
1,"I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span. from about 3 months to less than 2 months. not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one. but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great. it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!"
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
6,"The gel rest is comfortable.  However if you look at the picture closely. the pad is actually a bit thinner 4/3rd of the way to the left. I think the designer's ideal is to make the thickest part near the number pad on the right side..But the problem is that number pad is least used part of the keyboard. and when my hand rest on &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; key the right side gets a lot less coverage than the left side. and feel very unbalanced."
6,"I see too many negative comments. It's 5 bucks. How powerful of a book stand do you want for 5 bucks? No it doesn't lock. No it doesn't hold 2000 page dictionaries. However....Yes. it's 5 bucks....Yes. it holds a college books....Yes. it stays still (even without a lock!). Good stuff for 5 bucks. It holds a book.If you're thinking this will hold a large book. it won't. A large hardcover book. like a certification book. would have to be less than 400 pages to fit in here. The only way it would fit a large dictionary. as pictured. would be if you opened it to the middle page and never wanted to read any place else."
2,"I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go. I really like how fast it makes ice cream. I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out. Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl. So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream. The texture is just right when its finished. I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer. So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy"
11,"This is the Non-Deluxe Edition of the awesome game. Munchkin. It has all the same stuff as the Deluxe edition. save for the board. the figures. and the female/male cards. Although you can play without all those things. I would not suggest it as it gets very confusing very fast. The game is a bit difficult to master. but it is well worth your time and effort! The monsters are hilarious and the rules are obscure so indulge in some healthy arguments as you play. It's good practice for your next friendly facebook debate over the superiority of certain ice cream flavors as well as your stance on current gun control legislation.Bottom line: go get this and learn how to play it! It's worth your time. Heads-up. you'll need 3-6 players. so go make two friends before making your purchase. (SIDE NOTE: If you're having any trouble learning how to play. go watch TableTop on youtube.)"
4,"The film has it's own value. but some people underestimate the work by the team that made all of these films. todays CGI animation is great but the quality of such recent CGI hits in theatres wouldn't be there if this team never existed. The blazed the trail the same way Lewis and Clark blazed the trail across the united states and the work in all these films proves it because of how the stand the test of time. Besides. the cast of these films in beyond stellar they are legendary. Not &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF TTHE BOARD&#34; was in one along with other ledgends and if it's good for &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD&#34; it perfect for my household."
8,"My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets. and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer. and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover. paw print cover. and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was. so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on. but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
12,"When you first buy this game. you will need to give it time. Reading the  Manual first just might be alot of help. The game starts out in pause mode.  This gives you time to zone space for roads. residental &amp; commercial or  indutry zones. water pipes and electrical wires. It times take to know the  best way to zone RCIs. It's not easy and money can disappear fast so don't  go crazy zoning everything and destorying things. it will cost you. It sum  this review in one sentence. It takes time to build a perfect city so try  different approaches and eventually your get it right."
9,"It didn't clean my hands. which weren't very dirty in the first place and it ruined my hair.Maybe it's just me. but I tried one *drop* for washing my hair. Even pre-mixed it with warm water. No amount of rinsing could get it out of my hair. It left my hair all greasy/oily. My hair was cleaner before I put this horrid stuff in it!Had to re-wash a FEW times with regular shampoo to get it all out.Now I don't dare use it on anything else. It's awful. Sitting on a shelf collecting dust."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
9,"This SOG 'Flash II' pocket knife is an excellent 'every day' carry knife. While I personally prefer theGerber 22-47162 Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening Stainless Steel Fine Edge Knife. my son did not due to the weight so we found someone that was willing to trade the SOG for the Gerber. Here are my observations:Pros:+ Quality; this is a well made knife that will hold up to daily use quite well+ Speed; opens one-handed quite quickly+ Blade; comes razor sharp and holds an edge quite well+ Pock Clip; very sturdy. no worries at+ Positive Locks; this locks open/closed with a sliding buttonMisc:* Weight; this a very light knife compared to my other pocketknives. I prefer a little more heft but (as noted above) my son doesn't. so this is a matter of personal preferenceAn all around good knife at a reasonable price!Highly Recommended!CFH"
12,"Although the graphics arent as good as one would expect. the characters are very well done.  Espeically Sephiroth. he seems to be the very essence of evil with the tricks he pulls of in the game.  Many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the mini-battle game available in the Golden Saucer. also why didnt they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript?  This was probably to save money so Square wouldnt have to hire voice actors. Although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written story."
4,"I have to admit. I cried in the movie theater. at least twice. The guy next to my boyfriend wept like a repenting sinner. people cleared their noses and throats. They clasped their mouths.The brutal portrayal of Jesus's last 12 hours were gory. unhuman. bloody. tragic. and filled me with sorrow and love for him.It was an amazing movie. and the cast was perfect for it. A must see for anyone appreciating the deep topics.I think in a funny way. this hollywood production made me feel closer to God. it did not make me think any less of Jewish people. and it made me cry deeply when I got home. to let those emotions that I bottled up during the showtime. free.Go see it. I think everyone should."
12,"If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game. All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts. It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere. Even if this game was a buck it's so bad it couldn't even be a novelty. People who know this game might even make fun of you. Anyways I don't think there will ever be a good superman game it's sad."
8,"My kittens love this food and they certainly seem to be growing at healthy rate. My adult male cat doesn't really eat it but he's always preferred dry food so I buy this for the younger ones and their mother.  Mom and the litter were abandoned so I'm not sure what she was fed before but she seems to really like the food and its put some much needed weight on her. They seem to really like this flavor and the beef and chicken. Both are a bit smellier and oiler then the others but that's probably what they like."
7,"I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service; as a result. I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house.  I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it.  With this device. though. I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most.  You have not experienced convenience until you've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord. just a battery powered tool.  It is definitely not for large estates. but for simple short jobs. it is perfect."
8,"My box was definitely genuine because I bought it at Costco. Did NOT get rid of adult fleas and the infestation is as bad or worse as ever. I have to find something that works because my pets are miserable and the house has fleas now too. Too bad these medications are all becoming useless. They used to work so well. Does anyone know which one actually works nowadays. All these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds. I need something that works and is safe for my dog."
4,"We all know the story of Jesus Christ. He lived as a human and committed no sin. He was the perfect man. Because of this he was able to settle the debt we have built with our sins buy acting as a human sacrifice. This movie gives us a look at how his final hours may have transpired. It's very powerful and very upsetting.This is an incredible movie. It is passionate. as the title suggests. and very realistic. The acting is perfect and the message is timeless. Whether you believe that Jesus was the son of God or not. you can appreciate the passion and love he had for his fellow man. It's amazing to think that he endured what he did as a human. when he also possessed the power of God. If you can handle the brutality and emotional toll this film will take on you. I strongly recommend it. Be ye warned! It's extremely graphic and hard not to look away from at times."
12,"My favorite character is Sephiroth.He also makes an appearance in &quot;kingdom Hearts&quot; as the toughest boss in the game.(but i beat him!)Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mind-blowing game.Cloud is the main character of this game.He also makes an appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as 3 or 4 bosses.he's easy.The thing is.I couldn't even get past the mechanical scorpion!The game is just way too hard for me.But I beat it.The Sephiroth's are also Hard.If you're in for some action.buy this.Cloud is just such an amzig character.and so is Sephiroth.sincerly.kenny"
7,"After chasing food around the typical round metal & wood skewers for quite a while I decided to go on the hunt for a better skewer. and I found them! The 'flat vs round' design allows whatever food you have on them to stay in place so that everything cooks evenly. The point. although sharp is not overly so but still sharp enough to easily pierce raw meat and the 18' length gives you plenty of room to 'load em' down with goodies or space the food out whichever suits the food being grilled. The loop handle makes it easier to grasp the skewers with a mit or tongs.A previous reviewer mentioned the 18' length and I'll agree depending upon your grill this length may be a bit long and they may be a tad better 2' shorter [that reviewer just cut his to fit].I gave these skewers 5 stars as I don't anticipate having to find anything better for kabobs!"
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
8,"Current version of littermaid does not work well at all. The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it. The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original. The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version (on Amazon). It worked for six days and then died. It was replaced at no charge. The second one worked for six weeks and then died. I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase. So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product. This system forced me to give this product at least one star. I would give it -5 if I could."
6,"This is not of the same quality as the Kensington foot rest.  I now have both it and this one.It is a smaller version and does not have the same range of motion and comfortable gel foot pads.BUT. it is far cheaper.So in balancing the function versus the price it is a very acceptable solution to leg pain when working for prolonged periods at a computer desk.I was needing another foot rest at my L shaped computer desk but did not want to pay the high price of the Kensington model.When balancing the cost and usability of this foot rest I am pleased with my purchase.  It provides most of the same qualities of the more expensive options.  It is worth the price asked and I find it to be restful."
11,"I love having a stripped down version of the game for the kids or new players that get intimidated with how crazy the original can get with new rules and Creepers.  My kids love it and they don't need to read the cards as much as the pictures are fairly self-explanatory.  This might also make a good large expansion to throw in your original Fluxx game. though it might make some of it too easy and some of the new rules don't won't make sense unless you are playing with your family."
2,"Yes. upfront I'll say it's a little noisy. but that kind of goes with the territory.  Works perfectly. just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream. ice milk. bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients. I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it. but the quality is far superior to store bought. and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream."
1,"I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What's wrong with it?1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer. thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework. especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it's short. flimsy. & bends so easily. it doesn't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker. fluffier & stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself. and as such is totally useless. And. it shreds!I had read the poor reviews. and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
6,"Although I have had the opportunity to use other brands through the Vine program. I am still very pleased with the price and performance of the Avery brand of labels.  I have never had an issue with these labels smudging or jamming in my laser printer.  I use these not only for address labels. but also for frequently used notes on packages (e.g. Fragile) and to label file folder boxes as well.  The templates to use create the data for the labels are included with Microsoft Word and make easy work out of getting them printed properly."
8,"No matter how good the nutritional value is. or how good it smells. it's no good if the dog won't eat it. and mine won't.  I am SO disappointed.  I tried mixing it in warm water to make a gravy.  Smelled great.  He hated it.  I then tried heating the &#34;gravy&#34; to really mix the powder into the HOT water.  I let it cool.  Put it on his food.  Hated it.  Next I tried it dry. just sprinkled on top.  He hated that. too.  The good news is that my brother's Rottweiler loves it.  But he loves anything!  I wanted this supplement because I am concerned about my fussy eater.  Unfortunately. it didn't help ME. at all."
4,"Surprised this didn't make a bigger release and it's only available in limited quantities from Twilight Time. I bought this after hearing this movie was based on a novel by Dauphne Du Maurier who also wrote the classic &#34;Rebecca&#34;. This movie I found is almost just as good as Rebecca and is basically about a man bewitched by a mysterious woman. Performances from Richard Burton and Olivia De Havilland are great and it contains maginificent Oscar Nominated black and white cinematography and a haunting score by Franz Waxman. I recommend this movie to all movie buffs and you better hurry and get it before it goes out of print."
11,"The board consists of a map of the world in old parchment color tones. Once you setup the board with your character standees. other world gates. monsters. and clue tokens. you get a sense of the adventure you're about to embark on. If you can get behind the below. this game is perfect for your gaming group:- Cthulhu / Lovecraft enthusiasts. or Arkham Horror board game enthusiasts- A small amount of setup but thematic rules make it easy to learn how to play- No plastic miniatures and few dice. but a lot of cards which contain the meat of your adventure- Ultimately a storytelling game through card play and strategy discussion amongst the players- Lots of fun and immersive mechanisms in the game such as having your investigators go insane or defeated. fighting monsters. going to other worlds. encountering and dealing with personal conditions/setbacks. improving skills and gaining items and allies.- Long game of about 3 hours with 4 players and even longer with the full 8 player game"
2,"I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many. many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun. freezing winter. pouring rain. and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available. and the new one looks just like the old one. but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!"
2,"This is a great basic vacuum. It is great for my small apartment. I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood. I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off. My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose. That sliding mechanism is great. but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum. So. from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand. That said. i can always slap a piece of tape on that part. because otherwise this vac is so good. Suction is really great. Cant beat it for the price."
9,"I have discovered. through purchasing this pan to replace a different crepe pan. that I am crepe-handicapped. I tried. I really did to make beautiful crepes the likes of which I had in France all to no avail. Nothing to do with the pan and everything to do with me apparently. I do love this pan though. It is wonderful for pancakes and probably anything else you may want to cook. This is the lightest Lodge pan I own and it is so nice to work with. No hot spots. no cool spots just perfectly cooked pancakes that were made after my bitter dissapointment with the crepe batter. If you are not crepe-challenged (as I am) I highly recommend this pan. You cannot go wrong with lodge."
6,"I'm usually dissapointed in card makers but these are the best I have every used.  The paper looks much better right out of the box. works great in the printer. does not smear and most important gives you a photo-like image on the paper.They are a nice big size and come with their own envelopes (which is good since they are so big).  The images are really as good as premium photo paper when compared side by side.  They fold well. envelopes are good quality also.These might cost a little more than generic ones but well worth the price. cannot find one bad thing to say about them."
9,"Originally I had bought the Howard Leight Impact Sports electronic muffs but had to return them due to fit. I bought these to replace them and I really like them. The fit is really nice and they are comfortable. The noise cancellation works well too in outdoor and indoor ranges. I didn't find the battery compartment too difficult to get in to using a flat head screw driver. The negative thing I found was that the on/off button knob fell off when I first turned them on. Perhaps putting some locktite might help there."
11,"The game is great fun and has a different feel than most boardgames or euro-games out there. The first couple reviews were very thorough and they are accurate in their praise. If you like boardgames and you like Cthulhu. you will like this game. If you also like Lovecraft. you will LOVE this game. It is very horror based. and while the investigators can choose combat options. there is a lot going on that is pure horror based that has nothign at all to do with shooting things. Sure. as the keeper. I can summon all sorts of nasties to try to kill the crew. but its so much more gratifying to slowly drive them all insane and have them do the job for me! Very happy with the purchase."
9,"For pancakes. this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly. and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT. repeat. NOT to use any soap of any kind. sponge. steel wool pad. on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it. you can scrub the surface with a hot. clean water. handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning. pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap."
4,"Ben Carson was more then just a gifted surgeon. but a man who had drive and ambition within him that he did not even know he had.  His mother was a great influence in his life and it shows in this movie about Ben Carson's life.  If you really want to know what drives a man then you need to get the movie.  You will learn that what he said at the National Prayers Breakfast was real and that is why the media has since launched a campaign to keep him from advancing his philosophy on life."
9,"The issue I have with the CLUB CHAMP PUTT N' HAZZARD (sic) putting green is that every aspect of it feels cheaply made and likely to fall apart quickly. The back &#34;3D&#34; wrap-around uses Velcro and doesn't fit properly. It leaves gaps between the base and the wrap no matter how much I fiddled with it. The putting surface isn't bad at all. but needs a little ironing to lay flat. The ball return works well enough. The plastic cup. &#34;sand trap&#34; and &#34;water hazard&#34; are made of very thin plastic. Not durable at all. If you use this at your office. it will probably hold up. But if you have little kids like me. they'll destroy this thing pronto.Overall this putting green feels cheaply made. I'd look elsewhere."
2,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback. it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."
12,"I love this game.  I love this game.  I love this game.  I just got Ocarina of Time and it's been a few years since it has come out - it still rocks even in comparison to what's out now.  I've had a Playstation 2 for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there. but after playing Ocarina of Time. I realize that I had forgotten the beauty of Nintendo games.  They just have a special feel to them (and they make me remember the years that I was a little tike playing old Nintendo games).  I just beat the game about 5 minutes ago.  I certainly won't spoil anything. but I will tell you that the ending is over 30 seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see...  A video game hasn't brought me this level of satisfaction in a while.  Bravo Nintendo. bravo."
11,"The Programmer Rover was a huge hit for my boys. one 9 average student and the other 10 who is in  accelerated/challenge classes.The instructions for the rover come in a laminated spiral bound book. very good as it is needed to be referred to often for every programmable action and therefore be built to last. The instruction booklet is well illustrated. the written instructions were clear and my nine year old was able to program the easier beginner tasks without a problem.Our boys and their friends spend hours playing with and programming the rover.  The Smart Lab ReCon Rover has turned out to be both an educational and fun electronic 'toy'. well worth the money. A++"
6,"For me. I prefer the college ruled notebooks and paper because it just plain holds more info and the notebook last longer. This Mead is top notch quality that I use in different colors and write with different pens and pencils. The paper is of excellent quality so that whatever pen or pencil I choose. the page is highly readable with no smears.This notebook is suitable for any age from young students to senior adults. And I have found these notebooks I keep records in and love to use them next to my computer when I take notes from my computer research.This is a must have spiral notebook as in my opinion. Mead is the BEST ONE!"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
1,"It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often. The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them. no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem."
3,"Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover. Announcing it to her husband over breakfast probably wasn't the way to begin this adventure.Victoria Alexander has a way of making me laugh that no one else does! The antics of this husband and wife are truely hilarious. She really doesn't want a lover - just her husband's attention. He really doesn't want her to take a lover - but he offers to help. They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!"
2,"Without a doubt. this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift. but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).  It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.  Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.  Perhaps their freezers need adjusting?  In fact. after making ice cream (about 20 minutes) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking. so don't be afraid to try something innovative.  Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it. then improvise.We are healthy eaters.  It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.  It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!"
6,"I don't know how Avery continues to improve on products that seem to work so well. but they manage to find ways to tweak their labels to make them even easier to use.These labels work as promised - no jamming in my printer. the print is legible and clean. and the labels peel off like magic. I've used Avery products for years and I'm never disappointed. These labels are no exception. They zip out of my printer in a jiffy. and the labels are great to use on all sorts of packaging. I ship a lot of things in the craft bubble mailers. and these labels stick like a charm."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
4,"The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better .but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie. you might think it will be boring. so did I .but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics. then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace. the Power. the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel."
3,"These stories were just not on a par with the original. TWILIGHT PHANTASIES. and I was so disappointed.  Now this is just my take on this.  Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley.  I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me.  Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they don't have as many skills.  Also. they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright.  Just off somehow."
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
3,"I tried this book because I wanted something light and happy for this Christmas season.  I was very surprised to find it concerned an older hotel in San Francisco. one of my most favorite cities.  The heroine was a strong woman and she meets a man who is instantly attracted to her.  She is a little klutzy but all sorts of fun.  Personally. I can relate to that. I read this book I one short evening and think you'd enjoy this romance too.  If nothing else. it is a little different from the usual Contemporary Romance.  Happy Reading!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
3,"The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot. because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE. was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story. was the sex.  it was raw. very imaginative. and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story. in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99. at least this one was free. (ljb)"
2,"Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far. So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem. This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air. It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler. As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate. It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise. But for the price it does a good job. One thing however is that this fan scares my cats. It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review"
12,"Now u can have all of the classic games on ur ps1. It has many things to do on it unstead of just playing the original arcade game. What u can do is walk around the museum and look at all of the game rooms or just explore and see what is there. Each room that u walk in that is a game has a really cool movie clip before u play them. There is this one room that tells u all of the info about games and when they came out and how popular they were. Which is awsome to learn about it. The graphics in the museum r great for the ps1 but when u play the arcade games they got changed from the original by a tiny bit and the music is more clear. It has many of the classics that u can play single or multiplayer on which is fun. When u get this game dont think all there is is the arcade games in it. there is much more than that. It is an awsome game."
6,"These are the standard size/weight address labels. There's really not any way to make these exciting. but then again. do you really want excitement from an address label? These are exactly what you expect. and I have to say I really do prefer the name brand labels to the office store brands. They just seem to feed & stick more reliably.These feed easily in both the drawer and tray of my laser printer. peel cleanly (the non-label backing is already off the waxy paper. so removing them from the backing is super easy.I also really like that the label/template number is printed right on the label so you don't have to hunt down the package to generate the appropriate template. Finally. I like the box. It's sturdy corrugated with a flip-top lid so the lid won't go astray and the labels stay in the box. even if it's sideways on as shelf.Mine came with a sample of note tabs. a nice extra bonus."
4,"I watched The Passion at my church saturday night.  This was the second time.  The first was when it came out and it was a lot to take in.  This time it was different.  It was far more spiritual the second time - a year later.Being done in the language of the day is HUGE.  Both times I saw the movie I got the feeling that I was actually witnessing the day Christ was crucified.  Now when i see movies about Christ that are in English I have trouble connecting with them and somewhat even taking them seriously.I suggest that anyone. who thinks that Christ did not take on the sins of the world. should see this film with an open heart and mind."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
6,"This is an excellent product that makes an ordinarily tedious job much easier.  The trick is the 'Easy Apply label strips.' which allow you to print all five index tab labels at one time using a Word template that Avery makes available online.  Once they're printed. you just peel the group of labels off of the sheet and press the labels onto the folder tabs.  There's also a set of individual labels if you don't need sets of five.  It takes less time to do it than it takes to read this explanation.  The dividers themselves seem very sturdy. and they should survive pretty rough handling in a notebook.A new way of doing divider tab labels isn't going to change the world. but this Avery product makes life just a little easier.  Bottom line:  Well worth the money."
4,"I loved this movie. it would be a GREAT movie to show to a Youth group at church as I believe this movie teaches not only about Hosea. but it has a GREAT message about acceptance and how we all are going through things at one time or another and how we should not judge others because of their seemingly standoffishness.... (if this is a word).... I was shy as a young teen. and was going through things at home.... had no friends and I could relate to this girl..... thank you Beverly Patton"
9,"Meh...I bought these when a &#34;friend&#34; said they were better than the Howard Leights.  They're not.They do the same job. but complicate the issue.  Instead of one battery compartment (like the HL's). there are two. one in each ear.Rather than a single volume control. you now have one for each ear.  Great if you're a geriatric with varied hearing capacities in either ear. but just a nuisance when you want them both on the same volume anyways.Changing the batteries is a PITA!  Just a really disappointing design. to be honest.  I'd recommend the HL's over these 100% of the time.  Same price and better design."
2,"One messy African Grey together with a kibble-strewing canine in a kitchen where bread is baked 3-4 times a week was driving me nuts. I was so tired of schlepping out the Dyson 2-3 times a day to vacuum the above mentioned mess. The Eureka Quick Up Cordless is my new best friend. It was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger. The bonus battery pack ensures there is always plenty of power to get the job done. Because the Eureka Quick Up wasn't designed to suck the chrome off a truck's fender. don't expect it to take the place of a traditional vacuum. For those little messes that make you tired of dragging out and plugging in the big guns. the Eureka Quick Up is friggin' awesome!"
2,"LOVE this ice cream maker.  I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things. like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time. it seemed too easy. but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer. but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
1,"Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood. especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion. so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product. as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs."
3,"I very much enjoyed. It was sensual. and romantic.. Cal and Laurel were wonderfly done. I cheered for her through the entire story. A bit of mystery and a lost sole finding home. I could almost hear the wind in the trees. Miss Wildes painted such vivid pictures with her words.Will add Miss Wildes to my authors to watch.Storyline: outlaw romanceIntimacy: sensual. but not eroticEnjoyment: read with out stopping. did not want to stop for dinner.Book length: 41.000 wordsKindle length: na read in ePub format"
11,"I played this game once and was hooked! The rules are simple. You can modify it for kids. by. for example. not requiring their words to connect with each other. I like the speed. and in my family it's very social. True. during the game itself. you don't talk all that much--only groans of pain when you get a bad letter or get stuck and have to 'Dump' or wait for someone else to 'Peel.' Then there's the aftermath. where we critique each other's boards. make charges of cheating or bogus words. call each other 'Rotten Bananas.' etc.--all in great fun with lots of laughter. Scrabble can be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow--you could take a nap in a four person game while you await your turn. Takes about 10 minutes. max. This version of the game works for up to four people--for more than that I'd go for the double version. I love it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
11,"This unique game requires one player on his turn to come up with a word or phrase which describes a picture in their hand. It could be one word. a phrase or a sentence. The other players pick a card from their hand which they think matches that word or phrase. The pictures are fanastical and engaging. Selected cards are mixed and placed face up on he table. Players then vote on which picture they believe was the one who spoke the word or phrase. Points are awarded accordingly. The player who chose the word wants at least one person to pick their card. but not everyone. I highly recommend this game!"
6,"This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen. If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear. Granted. when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images. If you are not constantly printing. the nozzles will clog. It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer. After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer. I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000. My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable!"
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
1,"I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy. does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!"
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
2,"I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years. It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to.The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent. and it is made to last. High quality construction. great blade. and grate grip. and great price. What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet. they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower. sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find. but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time. your hands and wrist will feel the difference."
6,"These Avery labels are specially designed to coverup anything underneath them.  They call this TrueBlock. and if you want to be extra sure that nothing can be seen through the label you put on something then this is valuable.  If you don't need this then these labels would be an unnecessary expense in comparison to ordinary mailing labels.These labels are designed for laser printers. though you could also use them in an inkjet.  Just make sure you set the proper template in your word processor before printing.  These labels are something that I'll have available whenever I need to re-use a package/shipping envelope that has dark writing on it."
7,"Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
7,"I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house. and I love them.  They are practically indestructable. and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses. bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well. which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place. it can become very difficult to unscrew it."
3,"This is quite a bit different from Volume 1.  The first few stories were written from the perspective of the criminal committing the crime which was somewhat different.  But enter Dr. Thorndyke and justice is served.  The author is somewhat of a loquacios writer in that 10 or 20 words are used when 1 or none would do.  But he really does set the scene.  The authors of mysteries always need to create the  crimes and clues to match the expertise of esoteric knowledge of the protagonist but some of the these stories are over the top. However they are still very interesting and impart facts that I wasn't aware of.  They are extremely fun and interesting reads and I will continue to search for more like them."
12,"Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission. the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench. in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though. After you hit your target it just says 'Mission Complete' They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied."
7,"I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better. richer. darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well. I called the company and after a few passes around the office. I was told. then confirmed by another employee. that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So. they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose. but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer. mom. mage"
8,"My cats got infested with fleas and I had a hard time getting them under control. as a result I had many outbreaks of tapeworm in my three cats.  The vet bills got expensive after awhile. and since I had learned to identify tapeworm infection. with some research. I deemed these safe.  I am an infectious disease researcher myself. so I do have some experience.  These do work. BUT please ALWAYS check with the veterinarian FIRST before you try to self treat your pets.  The wrong treatment for the wrong diagnosis can lead to damaging consequences."
7,"Said to be drinking safe. this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season. OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems."
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
8,"I bought this product to stop the problem we were having with our 6 month old puppy. We have 5 little dogs that are paper trained. The product smells horrible to me. enough to make my stomach turn. I mixed it with canned food and all but one dog really loved it. I forced myself to tolerate the smell and continued to feed it to them for a couple of weeks once a day. It has helped to stop the problem even though one dog wouldn't eat it. I have stopped it for about a week now and it still seems to be working. I have my fingers crossed because I really don't want to smell it as I feed it anymore."
2,"Cutting bread without a bread knife is futile exercise. This bread knife works well and is very inexpensive. The blade is only about 8 inches. so it is not quite long enough to cut bread from a bread machine if the loaf is placed on its side.  I thought I had to get a longer knife. but then I figured I can stand the bread up so that it is much narrower.  That works. the knife is now long enough to cut very thin slices of bread that has about the same thickness as the Wonder sandwich bread that I used to buy in grocery stores."
9,"Kidding.  I've had the Classic SD for about 2 weeks now and am in love with it.  I bought it as a set along with the larger Tinker.  All tools function well.  My favorite is the toothpick.  The fingernale file comes in at a close second.  the little blade is sharp and workes well for its size.  This would be a usefull peice to add to a first aid kit. but this one travels in my pocket as my mini EDC.  Funny how quickly a small multi tool can become indespensible.  I rotate all my other blades. but this one is my constant companion.  Now if only they would add a corkscrew."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.What would the game be without Han & Chewie? The Falcon gives you these two characters as well as Lando and more. some extra abilities and a really nice. to-scale. model that you can also have fun with. 'Pew! Pew!' noises are an optional extra that you will have to supply yourself."
3,"Re-discovering all of Frank L Baum's 'Oz' books has been a hoot.  I read as many as I could get my hands on as a child; and so decided to check this one out on my new Kindel.  It's a lot of fun.  But no illustrations -- which are part of the fun of reading those books -- so that was a bit of a disappointment --  some misspelling and some dropped words from page to new page - but not so much that you cannot figure out what was supposed to be there.  I'd buy it in a hardcopy rather than Kindel edition. just to explore the illustrations (historical and fun in and of themselves)."
3,"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure. few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook. you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series. which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series. which includes Swords of Talera. Wings Over Talera. and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books. and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition."
1,"We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months)."
2,"Just received my Steamvac Jr. today and had pet stains waiting to be cleaned.  After they'd been around for a few weeks this little device didn't hold back the cleaning power.  Suction is awesome and I was so impressed I started to find things I wanted to clean...couch pillows. etc.  I just couldn't stop!  I'd recommend to anyone who's considering a handy. powerful tool of this nature.  (One note of caution...I didn't have the handles locked down all the way...my fault...and when lifting it off the counter after filling it up. it all hit the floor!!  Be aware of TWO locks. not one...)  It does come with a small bottle of cleaning agent which worked just fine but I purchased one separately anyway.  Enjoy!"
1,".Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day.  Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed. it drys my nasal membranes.  So I get frequent nosebleeds.  Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products.  I found that Ayr produces a gel. nose drops. and a mist.  I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful.  When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding.  My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds."
2,"... is home-made ice cream. I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess. quick. easy. home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks. too. including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction. powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve. but it's really true. if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours. it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this. because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice. but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
4,"Most Reliable biblical movie. The Gospel According to Matthew WORD-FOR-WORD is in the form of a movie. If a movie is not word-for-word it is not biblical. It is Hollywood. i.e. the Devil. Hollywood versus the Bible. You choose what you will feed your mind with. This is my favorite movie of all the &#34;biblical&#34; movies I have. Part 2 to Matthew is Acts. also by Visual Bible and also word-for-word. I give them out as gifts. They are less offensive to unbelievers and the religiously lazy who has never even read their Bible."
3,"I am a new Kindle user and downloaded my first issue of Reader's digest and was simply delighted with it!  I read it from cover to cover over a few days time which I have never done in the hard copy of the magazine.  I love that there are no ads and found it easy to navigate between the articles and features.  Thanks Kindle and Reader's digest!Its a few months later and I am updating that I still LOVE this magazine in Kindle format. I have seen a few people complain about not getting their back issues but I have no trouble at all with it. I had been off for a few weeks and when I returned I went to my Manage my Kindle on Amazon and there was a down arrow where I could select which issue I wanted to download so I selected both I had not read and voila! Both are on my Kindle now for me to read.  No problems at all.  Enjoy the magazine!"
3,"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie and since it was short. I read it in between other books in my TBR list. It was just okay on all counts - as erotica. it was passable; the plot wasn't exciting. but I did make it through to the end (although there wasn't really a burning need to); the characterization was okay - if the author had fleshed out her characters more. and improved the dialogue. it would've made a better book. There was some heat to it. and some of it was written pretty well. so that helped move the story along a little more than it would have otherwise. Since I did finish it to the end. and didn't hate it. I rated it as a 2.5. rounded up to 3."
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
4,"If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects. this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player. this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai. as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza. deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson. I have to say. has a very different personality. melodic approach. and technique from Vai and Satriani. but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."
1,"I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended. around twice a year.  I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections (which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday!).  AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex. Since I didn't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS.  It is significantly (25-30%) cheaper than AZO and works better (at least for me). For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs. Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior. The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering. it was wonderful."
1,"Its pretty good. its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals..."
6,"I can always depend on Avery to give me a quality product.  These little labels are what we use the most in our household.  They are handy for everything.  We use them with the free downloadable templates from their website so they are positioned accurately and look crisp and professional.  You can just print one or a whole sheet... and now the directions are right on the back of each sheet. very handy.  If you collect boxtops for education. they are cleary displayed in an area that can easily be cut out without disturbing the contents.No jamming. yet each individual label is easier to pick up without dislodging the outside border.  No problems.Highly recommended quality product."
4,"As I watch this movie for over the 50th time. have to laugh more and more. The movie is fun. yet have to wonder how Santa tolerated the elf and reindeer bullying. Reindeer tease poor Rudolf because of his nose. The elves tease poor Herbie because he doesn't want to make toys. and the head elf makes him work through his ten minute break. a true labor law violation.The Land of Misfit Toys is quite the site. can't help but to blame the elves for such mistakes. And why santa never knew about this place. since he knows everything and everyplace.The Abominable Snowman is more funny than scary. and is very entertaining.Always a classic and the flaws in the plot have holes bigger than the Grand Canyon. but that adds to the fun.A great way to enjoy a night by the fireplace with the family and friends."
11,"I recently wrote a review for the Forbidden Island board game.  In it. I said that I have been playing board games for a very long time and it is getting harder to find games that I can say are actually better than most of the games I have played before.  Forbidden Island was one of them that I would say that about and so is Ticket To Ride.  Like Forbidden Island. Ticket To Ride is very easy to learn and to teach how to play.  It will appeal to players of all ages.  You play as the owner of a railroad line and you are trying to fulfill contracts by placing trains on routes that connect cities all over a map of the United States.  The more contracts you can fulfill. the more victory points you can accumulate.  There are a lot of expansion sets released. with lots of new maps from all over the world and many more ways to play.  Ticket To Ride is a must have for any board game collection."
11,"This is a lovely puzzle. The image is fun and the pieces go together very well. The size is just right for little hands too! The box is great too - I opened the top flap and my daughter had fun putting the pieces away. The rope handle makes it easy for her to lug it around too.However. it's lower quality and more expensive than other brands such as Ravensburger. It's going to get beat up faster - the pieces were easily bent and just in shipping some of the pointier corners were bumped up."
12,"Sim City 3000 is really cool!  You start off by making a Power Plant(I prefer Fusion or Microvave).laying power lines.zoning Residentail.Commercail.and Industrial areas.disposing of garbage.Making Roads and/or a Mass Transit System.Make Water Structures and pipelines.and Take care of Civic needs.  Later in the game you might want to enact some ordinances(rules/laws).Make business deals with neighbors and organizations.set a budget(earlier on the computer does it for you).build rewards which most of them can only be optained thru Business Deals( ones optained without deal:county courthouse.Mayoral Mansion also know as you're house.city hall.performing of arts center.and Monument/statue. ones optained thru deal:Gigamall.Amusement Park.Space Port.Defense Contractor.Country Golf Club.etc.).  Plus you can add Landmarks to you're City.  This is a Great game.but for Sim City 2000 fans that want a totaly different game get the Unlimited Version(also known as Sim City 3000 Unlimited)."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
4,"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs. never the less. it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be. for the most part. some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film. with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram. the movie Joseph coming in a close second. and this movie. Moses. coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others. but the effort is exemplary."
6,"We have been using Scotch brand tape products for decades but not. until now. have we used this product. It is difficult to rate it because of infrequent need but on the one occasion we have used it thus far. it did all that we had hoped it would. If the item remains firmly attached after a month or so. I will add a star to my rating. Meanwhile. perhaps other uses will emerge. Tests and evaluations continue.Meanwhile. again. I say 'Thank You' to the Amazonians for the Vine Program."
3,"I have a version of 'Star by Star' that does not include the novella 'Recovery.' so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  'Recovery' tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in 'Balance Point.'  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship. it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out. like in the DVD's. where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it. but probably not to everyone."
9,"I am buying our third one for our third child.  This is a 'must have' for our kids between 18 months and 2 years.  The one we bought seven years ago is still going. albiet with a limp.  They have been used so much that the tires do wear out but the kids don't care!  The six and seven year olds still love their trikes as much as they do their two wheelers and they don't seem to notice that the wheels aren't round anymore.  Name one other toy you can buy for 25 bucks that lasts a kid from toddlerhood to first grade!"
12,"This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software. Then it did not have any voice sounds. Then it was running on windowed mode only. Now. everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer (BSoD).I give up. Codemasters. next time. dont rush a game out just because you have to. Test the game! If not for yourself for Colin himself. If he was alive he would be embarrassed.And don't buy the game using Steam because if it does not work. Steam will show you the finger :)"
9,"I love cooking with cast iron. This pan is great for making those 3 egg omlets. pancakes. fried eggs. etc. The low lip makes it easy to get the spatula under the eggs and flip them. On the down side if you fry bacon or sausages in it. the grease will spatter the stove. On a campfire that of course won't be a problem.However if you have limited space in your kitchen cabinet get the combo cooker. The lid is nearly as large as this one and you get the fry pan as well.On the plus side. this pan being thin fits right under the stack of cast iron pans I already own. So if you cook for a large family and want to serve everyone faster. this is a good way to go as an additional pan."
8,"I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats. That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house. I like blue. and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model. My cats still drink from this model. but it doesn't fit together as well as the deluxe model and. as a result. it often leaks. leaving puddles around it. If I purchase another. I will only get the Deluxe model."
3,"I'm not fairy tales redux. but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in one sitting. This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot.the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior. but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice. but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So. I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
3,"This book was a little slow in the beginning. but once the killing started. I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems. but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence. this book does not disappoint!"
1,"Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy. but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times). the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare. because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son. as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first. but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me. you want this product!"
1,"Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I've tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle. the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference. resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there. we're sticking with the Mach 3."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
9,"We've had a great time as a family throwing this around the soccer fields.  Luckily we have a large park area with enough space for 4 soccer fields all together cause this thing really flies.  Its soft so that it doesn't hurt if one of the small ones misses their catch.  The hole in the middle provides a good way for someone to get a grip or to catch it ring toss style.  Light and easy to throw for all ages.  Get one of these. and get out for some family disc time.  You will be glad that you did."
3,"...with a twist of goth and one seriously bad serial killer!This book really held my interest all the way through. but then the ending came and went in a flash.  With so much build up. I would have thought the ending would take longer to complete itself - not so.The detail given to describe the setting of each scene was incredible.  Also. you were provided deep insight into the characters. even the lesser ones.  There was nothing vague about this book.Formatting was off. but it wasn't too distracting after a while."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
6,"We have been using this particular DryErase/Flip Chart outside of our store for 2 years now. We do not use it as an 'Easel.' but rather as a hanging board (where it hangs downward) to promote specials and products.After purchasing another product that didn't work. we were especially grateful to purchase this particular one. It is sturdy. and except in high winds. we do not have a problem with it blowing over. Best of all. we can write on both sides - either turning it sideways so it can be seen by cars / Pedestrians coming from either direction. or facing front. with the ability to turn it later in the day to promote a different sale (especially helpful for Thanksgiving day sales).As a small business owner. I appreciate the flexibility of being able to promote items without a lot of hassle. and this particular chart has been especially helpful to us."
2,"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker.  I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet.  I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl.  However. all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it.  The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim. it was a substantial amount.  Sadly. this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used."
1,"After years of having toe nails that grow oddly while at the same time toe nails that would turn almost black . I started using this medication. Even after a just-a few weeks I have noticed a great change and would not be without it. My toes nails re now growing with a distinctive clear color rather than black and they are beginning to take a normal shape instead of the one-fourth inch thick toe nail I used to have. It is still too early to tell if the medication is going to completely clear up the fungi. however it appears it is working quite well."
1,"This is by far the best product...ever...for Urinary Infections.  Better than anything you can have prescribed by a Doctor.  I did a lot of research about Cystex before I even ordered it.This is a very cleaver product...each tablet contains 1/2 of a normal aspirin. which acts against the immediate pain. and another ingredient that creates a chemical reaction in the kidneys and bladder and kills the bacteria and cures the problem.  I am a very allergic person and afraid to take any medication. but this is a dream come true for me.  Don't expect it to work in minutes. but all of a sudden...in a few hours...you will feel pain free.  The bottle says dose is 2 Tablets every eight hours. but I only take one every eight hours for two days and it's just great.  This is a staple for every medicine cabinet."
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
8,"Please note that though my dogs are capable of ripping this or any fabric toy to shreds. for reasons only known to them. they don't do this. (a Big Retriever Mix & a giant Great Pyrenees mix). This squeaky duck is their favorite for fetch and the toy each consistently chooses to initiate a few rounds of big dog wrestle-rumble. The squeaker holds up to a lot of use and this toy does just fine when run through the washer & dryer. if you find your pup or pups tend to &#34;suck&#34; their stuffed animals and thus render them totally funky."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
12,"'Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back' was a large step up from the first part. This game's graphics. music. gameplay. and even story were much better than in the first. But it's kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot doesn't end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister. Coco Bandicoot. Well. at least Coco has the ability to speak. unlike her big brother.The voice acting changed dramatically as well. and for the better(Dr. Neo Cortex's new voice was much cooler and evil-sounding). If you liked the first Crash game. get this one. Although it's more difficult(especially in gathering Crystals and Gems). it's really fun!"
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
2,"This is an awesome little machine for the money. Yea... The plastic is a little cheap and it is a little loud but you cannot beat the price or the power. It is perfect for hard surface floors. No it does not leave marks on wood floors. If you drag the cord under the wheels you'll get a mark from the wax on the cord but most people with a hint of intelligence should know better. No the canister does not easily tip over. I honestly don't know where some of these silly reviews are coming from. This is a great little vacuum for the price. If you want perfect go spend two hundred dollars."
6,"Another effective Avery office product that's relatively easy to use. Works fine with our home(Panasonic) and office(HP) laser printers (I didn't bother trying the labels with our ink-jet printers).  Avery provides FREE templates for Microsoft Word and also their own Design and Print Online.  It was easy to print out address labels for our clients.  Just make sure the printing is aligned properly with the labels.  The Pop-up Edge feature ensures effortles peeling of the labels.  There were no smudging.  Avery has kept it simple and useful."
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
9,"What I like:Aesthetically pleasing to look at. handle and use.  The stainless steel is very appealing. and holds a nice shine.  The tools opening and locking have a very substantial. visceral click.  The curve of the plyer handles are very comfortable.It comes with a very nice. light-weight nylon SNAP pouch (I hate the velcro ones).It's lighter in weight than a Leatherman Surge. which is what I carried for the past ten years.What I dislike:Nothing.  I'm willing to sacrifice one-handed blade deployment for what I consider an aesthetically superior MT."
2,"Awesome product... just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid... leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.  Also. you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.  My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.  Other than that. its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.  If you really like ice cream or have a large family. you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.  The ice cream will go fast!"
7,"I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November.  It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem. Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers. I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so.  In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow. spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush.  To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year. They've moved away from my yard.  The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers.  Now that I've seen how well they work. I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings.  I can't believe I didn't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures."
6,"Overall these are very good labels and my complaint doesn't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once. but I do.  With the easy peel labels the sheet tends to get stuck a little more in the printer then before. but it's not a ton.  And I reuse sheets because really. I'm not wasting a whole sheet for 2 or 3 addresses!  Besides that I've never had a problem with these labels smudging or not sticking. I've always been pleased with Avery labels."
12,"I own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made. I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges. Some good things about it is that this is the only Spyro game where you free the dragons. In the rest of the games. you help other people... It is funny and very interesting. ( Sorry. but I won't give the funny parts away. )The disadvanges is that you can't swim. In the other to games you can but in this game. if you touch the water you will die!!Another bad thing is that they don't have the cute characters like the other two games. I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1. I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line. I even think Spyro has a better voice. If you like all three Spyro's. try buying the Spyro pack. It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly. Then you can decide which one is better!!"
3,"This story is the beginning to a series and I really enjoyed it. The price point is about right for these short little stories so don't expect too much as this is very short. Dana Marie Bell has a new fan in me as the story moves right along. isn't too out there and I loved the domineering little Emma and how Max responds to her before even seeing her again. I thought the 'marking' her was a little abrupt. but I can look past that by saying that A) this is about shapeshifters and B)An Alpha gets what he wants when he wants it.Buy. Read. Enjoy."
1,"I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days. so rather than go broke buying batteries. I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries. 4 Batteries Included. which gives us a set to put in her leap pad. and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well. and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money. especially if you go through a lot of batteries."
4,"This is a sweet story. about a poor little drummer boy who can only offer a gift of song to the baby Jesus. Even toddlers are quick to notice the stop-action animation and the distinctive soundtrack that was recorded by the Vienna Boys Choir. Our toddler called it 'Camel' as he loved to see the dancing animals which of course included a dancing Camel.The cast features voices you will recognize;Jos&eacute; Ferrer  - Ben Haramed [Voice]The Vienna Boys ChoirPaul H. Frees  - [Voice]Greer Garson  - Storyteller [Voice]Ted Eccles  - [Voice]Jules Bass ad Arthur Rankin. Jr.  - Directed. Produced. and wrote this christmas classic.BOTTOM LINE: A Christmas Classic for the whole family that never wears out!"
4,"Others who are more knowledgable than I have reviewed the content of this disk and I agree with them for the most part. Let me address the technical issues.  First the picture is mediocre at best.  This is a video source from several years back and it shows.  Things get lost in the blacks and the picture is very soft.  Second. the surround tracks are very disorienting with the voices occasionally issuing from the rear speakers for no reason that i can determine.  I would love to see these companies start putting out disks that at least SOMEWHAT live up to the capabilities of the format."
12,"People seem to forget the number one reason Final Fantasy 7 is loved so fondly and remembered all these years later- it was one of the first video games able to tell a story that MILLIONS of people cared about.  In fact. it's probably the first RPG to ever tell such an incredible story.  It was also groundbreaking back in the day having extremely-realistic cutscenes featured. along with a quest that carried over 3 discs.  That's why the game is remembered.However. I have no idea why the price for the game jumped up to almost 70 bucks these days.  I guess because everyone who owns the game refuses to give up their copy."
11,"We've become board-book experts (snobs?!) over the last ten months. This is by far one of the nicer 'touch and feel' varities out there. The feeley spots are large and visible for young babies and there is a nice variety of textures: terry cloth towel. sand paper. faux grass. deep shaggy fleece. silk leaves that crinkle. short fuzzy fleece. The pages are stiff ad sturdy. the spine/binding is well made. Colors are bright and photos are pretty. Our 10-month-old daughter loves this book! (...Now. if only it had 'lift and look' flaps too. it would be perfect!)"
6,"Outside of being able to attach this to your car's rim and use it as a tire. this calculator does about everything.  And. for a reasonable price!  This is the required calculator for the 6th grade here in Ohio. but I originally purchased mine for an advanced chemistry class for a top 10 university course 18 years ago.  It's still the one I grab every time I need a calculator - it performs all the scientific notation that I need. and doesn't become cumbersome like the TI-83.  I've used this for everything from calculus. microbiology. biochemistry to advanced chemistry and it's worked like a dream.  For the price. it just cannot be beat and durability. well that speaks for itself.  Highly. highly recommend!"
12,"I was looking for a racing video game for my new playstation. and everyone I talked to told me to get Gran Turismo.  And now I know why.  It's so fun!  It's challenging. but not impossible.  The graphics are good and realistic. and there are tons of cars to choose from.  I really like the simulation mode where you can race for money and buy new cars or upgrade old ones.  I'm a huge fan of my Dodge Viper with racing stripes.One thing that's not so great about this game is the space that it takes up on your memory card.  Just to have a simulation mode game going. you need 5 empty blocks.  If you want to get into saving replays and stuff. it can use up to 15 blocks.  Memory cards are expensive... I'm not willing to devote an entire memory card to one game. no matter how great it is."
9,"This is a great pre-seasoned griddle. I make perfect pancakes and crepes everytime.  I usually add a teaspoon of vegetable oil before cooking to keep the surface extra slick although I probably don't need to.  Making crepes is as easy as making soup from a can.  Be aware that the handle gets hot so keep an oven mitt close by and follow the cleaning instructions. you don't wash this with soap or stick it in the dishwasher. This is one of the few lifetime purchases you can get for under 20 bucks.  So cheap I'm going to buy another one."
1,"If your going to try it and it has a applicator brush in it too . I bought the pen and it lasted about 6 weeks . Tea tree oil is really the best stuff . I am making some progress using both and planning to try kerasil or the vics vapo rub next if this doesn't clear it up after 6 months . It cleaned my little toes quick but my big toes just won't clear up . They look better but stay yellow - not gross anymore but slight greenish yellow . Getting old is no fun and either is using a dirty shower in a truck stop . Been paying for one slip in doing that for 25 years now but I treat it daily and know I won't do the same to someone else ."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
12,"Final Fantasy 7 is the best FF I have yet to play.  I have played 8 and 9 also. but 7 has the best music. battle system. and junctioning system of all of them (not to mention the greatest story-line in the history of everything!).  Besides a couple of translation errors. this game is perfect.  I was introduced to Final Fantasy 7. 3 years ago. and I still do not know many things about it. So if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you. but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it. you should buy this game. and before they stop selling it."
7,"Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then. the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months. but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody 'improved' them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet. so I don't know how these will perform."
11,"This is a nice colourful puzzle. with a simple design for youngsters 2 years and up - probably to about 4 or 5 years. The 25 pieces are big; each is about 4' x 4'. What is good is that the top edge of each puzzle piece is slightly rounded on the edges. which will help keep the picture from peeling away. However the pieces. themselves could be thicker. so that young hands would not be able to bend them so easily.The box is relatively solid and with care will last. Although. the cardboard `catch' to keep it closed starts to show signs of wear after a few uses. The cord is soft and makes it easy to carry the puzzle box.It does seem a bit pricey at this time. for such a simple puzzle."
4,"Dr. Satan. you seem to think you know Mel's motivations. I think you're speaking through your jaded perceptions. When Mel started work on this film. he ponied up his own money. He didn't even have a distributor for the film. but he went on with the production. He filmed a movie in two dead languages. He has spent another $10 million of his own money to build a church building in his hometown. His actions show him to be a devout man.If he were only concerned with profit he could have churned out another Lethal Weapon movie. His films and him personally have already made a mint.I saw The Last Temptation of Christ. aside from the final sequence when He comes off of the cross. the movie not very risky."
11,"I bought this to have while my grandchildren were here. They arrived several days before Christmas. They chose to name him Scottie. after Poppy who's middle name is Scott. Every morning he would show up in a new place ;-) As soon as they woke up they would begin their search for Scottie. Since he loses his magic if he's touched. I would place him out of reach to remove the temptation to test that theory. lol. We all had so much fun with Scottie that I am looking forward to his return from the North Pole next year. Your Elf will come with a book to read to the children which explains his presence and purpose."
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
4,"I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC. the most distasteful film I've ever seen.  The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass. Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome. disgusting. gratuitous gorefest.  Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't). but even in that case. I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic."
7,"This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker. I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!"
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
6,"We like to keep one non-electric phone in the house in case power goes out.  We have learned that during hurricanes. earthquakes and even big power failures that sometimes even cell phones don't work but these non-electric phones that plug right into the telephone outlet work when other things don't -that is if your phone service is not from the cable company but driectly from the telephone company. In regular day-today activies we use only cordless and cell phones but they can be useless in an emergency so we like the safety of having one phone like this.  This is fine little phone and the price as great."
3,"A very good collection of folk tales from Britain.  The author tried hard to make sure that the stories were commonly from Britain though they may have spread elsewhere or a variation came from elsewhere.  Some very English folk tales?  Henny Penny. Jack and the Beanstalk.  there are many Jack tales. and The Three Bears.  Most have humourous endings and seem to be stories to amuse everyone.  Jacobs.  the author said he used fairy tales in the title because no kid ever asks for a folk tale."
8,"My cat has gotten tape worm a few times now from being infested with fleas (when a cat gets a flea in its mouth that is infected with tapeworm they get it) and nothing worked! I tried a few different tablets and the only thing I found worked to get rid of them was taking my cat to the vet for a shot which was pricey. Just from taking 1.5 of these pills. my cat's worms were gone and for a fraction of the price of taking them to the vet! Would definitely buy these again if needed!"
11,"Up front. this is totally a guy game.The rules are simple and the desire to keep playing is there.  2-6 players use three simple stats to move around the board attacking one another and using various cards that represent weapons. armor. power ups. and 'cheats'.  Play to a certain score. the winner gets an additional stat point.Form alliances. betray your friends. look the other way when it suits you.  The combination of plays are almost endless.If you like small scale war games and are looking for something with a more individual approach to warfare this is the game for you.We even use custom maps (think of those vinyl Dungeons and Dragons mats) to mix it up after a few dozen rounds on the board it comes with (which is double sided)."
12,"Graphics: 8/10 - Really neat little things you might not notice. Sometimes a little too computerized. but still eye-catching.Sound: 8/10 - Very much improved from the first Crash Bandicoot. When things hit the ground. they make a bang. when creatures talk it's amazingly clear and when you're in danger. you certainly know by the sound a creature is making. the rumbling of the ground or the thrilling score.Value: 10/10 - This is one game you will start repeatedly and still have the same enjoyment level every time you play.Overall: 9/10 - A big improvement from the great first game. Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back has it all - story. characters. levels and fantastically constructed colouring and visuals."
1,"I've been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.For what it is worth. I'll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I'm always finding flaws in electronics. etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to 'vibrate' the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I've done this on trips of up to one month with great success. but that isn't like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid."
11,"This game has serious flaws which Fantasy Flight refuses to address. I have owned it for over a year now and they are in denial or simply don't care about the problems it has. The Lannisters are completely broken and it basically ruins the fun of the game. FF is usually a great company but they drop the ball on this product in both the original edition and now again in this one. I would not recommend this game to anyone and it sits on my shelf gathering dust. It is a great concept and an amazing genre. but the broken aspects of the game (Lannisters are far to weak and Stark/Baratheon are FAR too strong) make the game boring and unplayable."
7,"I bought this to try at my parents' cabin.  They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants. specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated.  So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful.  But. then again many other chemical sprayers reek.  Also. this is not a set it and forget option.  You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply.  Lastly. you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept.  I'd use it again."
8,"I bought the first one and the cat liked it. Do not over microwave. it will melt. The trick to having it last 8 hours is the pets bed.I am using this for a mini doxie. 5.5 lbs. I bought her a tunnel bed. and she wears a light sweater. with the snuggle in her bed she is not waking me up to put it inthe microwave at 3 am.Mini dogs have to be kept warm. they die fast. I micro this and put in her car crate when we travel around town."
11,"This game. along with Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne. is one that I always use as a 'Gateway Game' to get friends and family who are not serious board gamers hooked on games.Ticket to Ride is easy to teach and learn. fun to play over and over again. and doesn't take too long to get through (most games lasting under an hour).  The game doesn't suffer from a lot of random chance (e.g. no dice rolling) and relies on player planning and skill to win.  There is the option to go after other players and have a pretty cut-throat game. but that is not necessary to gameplay if it is not your style.If you are already a big fan of board gaming but you haven't played any of the Ticket to Ride games. skip this one and go straight for Ticket to Ride Europe.  It has a few additional more complicated elements such as ferries and tunnels. and a more complex and congested map board."
1,"I had to try this after reading its description.  My denture comfort liner had come off (as my orthodontist said it would) and I couldn't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture.  I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me. and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  Even after I faithfully followed the instructions. I got poor results.  It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and. much to my surprise. the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it's an effort. just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results. but that didn't work either."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
6,"This size of address label has many uses.  Of course. they can be used for addresses on packages and envelopes. but also as identification labels.  I printed a sheet with my name. address and phone number to attach to things I take on vacation.  The print on my inkjet printer was clean and crisp. the ink dried quickly (no smudging). the labels indeed do peel easily and I like the translucent background that works with many surfaces.  Word 2010 had the format in its list of labels and each label was perfectly aligned.  You can also download free templates from Avery's web site."
4,"This is one of the best. and I mean the best explanations of creation without getting 'mushy' religious and anti-scientific. Often Christian views of creation are so anti-scientific and so prejudice that anyone truly wanting a balanced Chrisitan view that includes your mind is left out. This is the DVD for you. Challenging. thought provoking. even funny and entertaining at times. Rob Bell presents to you the best presentation for creation I've ever viewed. You won't be disappointed.I am presenting this material for viewing in a mini-series to and for non-Christian. seeking-the-truth people. I'm not ashamed to present this DVD to these people seeking God. yet skeptical and cautious of the Christian perspective."
9,"I have used lots of traditional and not-so traditional frisbees and this is the best yet.It is just the right weight and size. flexes nicely during catches and flies very. very far.It also slices through strong winds really well and doesnt seem to 'Float' as much as other disks; so goes where you want it.My children. 5 and 7. have finally learned how to throw and catch because this is easier to throw and catching it doesnt hurt their hands.I recommend this product."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game I have ever played in my entire life.I have been playing nintendo for years and I have played some of the older Zelda games before but I never owned any. as soon as I tried this game - I immediately loved it and I've played it millions and millions of times.  I am so obsessed with it. I went out and pre-ordered the Wind Waker to get the Zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to Nintendo Power to get the Zelda Collector's Edition disc.There is no need for me to review this game - all I really need to say is buy it.  You will not be disappointed (if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain).  Definitely be sure to get the follow up Majora's Mask and the Wind Waker.  A must play and Link is the best hero ever."
3,"Such a shame that leaders controlling people elders etc are still wounding the body.Numbers of Christians that leave churches because they haven't. Found a way to cope with the pain of betrayal by those who are suppose to love them.Trusting in the power of God to change the situation until you know it's time to change churches take courage.This book maybe the answer to staying open to Gods purpose for you helping you work through the feelings and anger(at times) don't leave God don't stop loving God just because the waters are muddy in the church."
9,"I have owned three of these stoves over the years.  i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model.  The windscreens are cheaply. made. fall off the stove which then doesnt  support the rear screen.  Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid.  The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
12,"I tried to like this game. I really did. but the controls are horrible and some of the worst I've experienced when trying to shoot something. When playing I also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the Playstation platform. While the story is well-done. it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay. So I'll understand if Syphon Filter fans hate me because of this review. but seriously the gameplay is terrible."
4,"Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion. and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years. and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar. you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II). so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks. Paul!"
7,"These things work great!  Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up. then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect.  I've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio. under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds.  Lots of flies gather round there. and these traps fill up quickly.  Nary a fly makes it to our patio. even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap. we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!  Only downfall. they are a little stinky. I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away. but since it's not close to our 'living space'. it's no problem."
6,"I rcvd my black trim line phone today. Out of the 352 reviews I only read the #1 rated ones. to see what was said. Several people said people on the other end cannot hear well. I immediately tested mine. and called 2 friends. who both said they could hear me quite clearly. It is funny how there are always people who harshly criticize products in these reviews. yet so many other people do not find anything wrong. I wonder how that can be. can there really be such a big difference between one unit and another. I thought I would like the Black color best. and it cost less than the White. but I see now that the Black shows finger print smudges very easily. I will be keeping it on my bookshelf for use during power outage."
8,"I've found that almost all cats strongly prefer to drink running water as opposed to still water. Cat eyes are attracted to motion. My cats drink much more often from a fountain than a water dish which makes me feel better about their health. Cats love this thing. the only cons are from the human maintenance side of things.Cons: A water fountain is more work than filling up a dish. You must plug it in. turn it on. clean the pump. replace the filter. and refill the resevoir often. This does get annoying but is not a problem unqiue to this fountain. and to me it's definitely worth it for my cats.The fountain is pleasant looking. a perfect size. and very quiet."
4,"Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley. live and in person.  Sadly. he lost his life in a swimming accident. and the world will be diminished. musically. by this tragedy.  However. some of his finest work is captured here.  This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating. and his voice is haunting.  Give yourself a musical treat. and pick this DVD up.  The only reason I gave it 4. instead of 5 stars. is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine.  The program stalls in this song.  I checked on more than one DVD player. and they both manifested the same pause.  Other than that... a great buy!"
12,"Well. I'm going to have to agree with Darth Vader on the strong part. But as for the force part. I'm nonchalant. Star Wars Rogue Squadron begins somewhere in between Star Wars Episode IV and Episode VI. Let me just say. you'll be visiting place in the Star Wars universe. and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies. which is good with me. The graphics in the game are some of the best you'll ever see on the N64. The music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done. This is. I would say. the best Star Wars Rogue Squadron game ever made! Oh. and by the way. yes I have played Star Wars Rogue Squadron: Rogue Leader. I fully recommend this game! And thats my review! Remember. 'Be a customer. Not a consumer! Period'- Jake Smithers"
1,"I have extremely dry skin and was constantly itching and scratching. sometimes actually causing bleeding. I tried AmLactan Mosturizing Body Lotion and FINALLY got some relief from the constant scratching. It took about four days to completely stop all the scratching. I used the product just once a day. even though the directions say to apply twice daily. Now my skin is soft and silky feeling and the scabs from bleeding have disappeared. The ammonia like smell of older bottles that I have used is no longer present. They seem to have improved the formulation. It's now completely odor free. I just found the 20 ounce size on sale at Costco.com for $15.49 including shipping. I will never stop using this product. It works just as advertized. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and itching. Visit the manufacturers website at amlactin.com for more information and you can even sign up for their newsletter. I'm a fan FOREVER!"
7,"I bought this last year so this is the first spring I have had to use it.  I am seriously impressed.  I am using it for popping out weeds. hacking down dead vegetation and planting.  It doesn't dig a wide hole and does not work as well as a trowel for removing dirt while planting. but it works much better than a trowel to plant in my horribly rocky clay areas and the blade makes it easy to puncture a hole to put the plant tag.The sharpness of this is tool makes it extremely useful.  I think the serrated blade will make sharpening difficult. but for this price it is well worth getting a new one when it gets dull.  I will definitely do so and am buying some for gifts for my fellow gardening friends.Also. if you wonder what the difference between the models 1515 and 1516. according to the company's web site this one is a stainless version of the black 1515."
7,"After putting this together I found it to be quite unnerving. It reminds me of a javelin. Sure it's long. but it wobbles! Do I really feel comfortable holding a wobbling chainsaw over my head? No. It cuts at the high height level but it is very unsteady and takes a bit of muscle to keep it straight on the branch. The problem is the saw blade head is just too heavy compared with the shaft and bottom.  It basically sways in the air.  I will not be using the extension rather I will just stand on a ladder to reach the higher branches. There really should be a steel pole in each piece to give it some stability. One more thing is that the blade cover doesn't stay on. It should have been designed with a clip of some sort.I'm one of those people who always throws away the product box. but I think I'll be saving this one in case it breaks.Comment Comment  Permalink"
11,"This is just a fun. creative toy.  It starts as a ball and comes apart into mini 'pyramid-like' pieces.  From here. you can use your imagination and create new objects (animals. stars. etc.).  It also has a strangely soothing feel when you are putting it back together.The only drawback is that the magnets could be a little stronger.  Sometimes it is hard to get your new creations to stay together because they slip.  However. overall this is a really cool toy.  Good for kids and adults."
11,"As a teacher. I had to buy this gift for my seven-year-old niece.  She loved making her own book. and the finished product that they send you is very professional looking. like a book that you would purchase from a store.  They even included some tips and activities to help children write their stories. including diagrams for pre-planning and brainstorming.  My niece loves her book and shows it off to everyone - she even took it to school and got to read it at storytime.  This is a great educational activity that really gets children to be creative. and they love it.  Buy it for all of your favorite kids!"
4,"I've never worked out to a DVD or VHS in my life. preferring to go to the gym and take classes. or to use exercise machines.  This DVD was so FUN and diverse. not at all boring or annoying.  Kathy Smith is energic but not overly so. and she avoids talking and counting constantly which I find distracting and irritating.  What I like is the customized option in which you can choose you work out length-- perfect for when you need to save time or when you want a more vigorous. lengthy work out.  You may find yourself flubbing through the first two go-rounds. as I did. until you get the hang of it. but once you catch on. you REALLY feel the burn if you do it right.  Good work-out for beginner or moderate (I'm a moderate) exercisers."
3,"I read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I went on a buying spree and got the other two as well as this short story. I suppose Laine's antics were meant to be comedic relief but I did not laugh not once. His antics were not funny. I did not buy Devlin being so amused by Laine's antics.I was shocked with how they resolved the conflict with Victor. I thought it was a weak plot point. This story was just ok. I wouldn't recommend anyone spending the money to buy it. If it were free. then yes."
7,"I have had this feeder for about 5 years now. it has never fallen apart. I don't know what the other people are talking about-wobbling-if its hung on a tree or pole hook it swings a bit but how does a hanging bird feeder wobble? Anyway its not the best made on the market. but the birds seem to like it. It is a pain to take apart to clean and it should really have metal perches instead of plastic. The squirrels have gnawed off two of the perches since they hang upside down and eat the Safflower seeds (even tho they are not supposed to like it)I am ready to replace it now-but will be looking for a feeder with the metal perches instead."
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
6,"Scotch Gift tape is a great product for its intended purpose - wrapping gifts.  The tape is much less noticeable on typical gift wrap than either Scotch Magic Tape (which is a bit too matte for this purpose) or shiny generic tapes.But I have to mark down this particular product down because the amount of product given is so stingy.  Each roll only has 300 inches of tape - compare this to a a Scotch Magic Tape refill that I had sitting in my cabinet that was 1296 inches long.  And I dislike the fact that the product description on Amazon says nothing about how much tape is included. so you won't realize the issue until you get your order."
11,"My three year old son loves this puzzle and has put it together every day for the last week.  It is bright and colorful with cute illustrations of animals at the zoo.  It is age-appropriate for two to four year olds.  I usually help my son put it together by giving him hints on what pieces might work if he gets stuck. but overall it is not difficult for him.  The puzzle has 25 pieces. is a 5 by 5 square. and is fairly large.  The pieces are large. seem durable. and go together easily.  The box is also cute with a carry handle. which allows my son to tote it between rooms and encourages cleaning up after putting it together.  Overall. I have to say this a great puzzle for toddlers and young children."
1,"Lactose intolerance can be very stressful to deal with. Having to decline food. opportunities to eat because you can't digest is embarrassing and annoying. This solves the problem. Take one with your first bite and you can eat dairy products. It says take another after 45 mins but to be safe I would take it 30 mins after if you continue to eat dairy products.I prefer these to the chewables because I can fit a few in my wallet.If you have an empty stomach. be careful when eating lactose containing foods and drinking lots of liquids at the same time. That is the only time I've ever had issues. I took a bite of bagel with cream cheese and a Lactaid and then chugged a bottle of water. needless to say the Lactaid wasn't able to work very well in my empty stomach filled with water and a bit of cream cheese. my stomach was very upset.I drink the Lactaid milk all the time as well - I really like the whole milk.Great products."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
7,"Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months. BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB.Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different. to me. that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack. then bump up to 5 stars."
1,"1. I was scared that it would sting so badly. and no it's totally bearable and it will go away in a matter of few minutes.2. I once used it all over my body (pits. back. chest). and that was a hot day! And I did sweat a bit. but 90-95% of the sweats were eliminated.NOTE: DON'T use it on large area. not only it will sting really bad the night you apply it. the next day whenever your body trying to sweat it will sting too! BUT if you just use it for underarm alone. everything's fine.3. It lasts for approx. 2-3 days before you'll have to reapply it. Once I used a lot (and by a lot I mean A LOT). it stayed effective for over 5 days!!!4. Instead of rolling it directly to your underarm. you should roll it on your palm. and apply it with your palm so that it won't drip."
11,"For those of you who are interested in playing a boardgame. but have really no experience in playing them. this is a great start. Anyone over the age of six or so should not have a problem sitting down and enjoying this beautiful and sleek game.The mechanics are very easy. Collect cards with train cars of the same color to buy enough train cars to cover a route. If there is five blue spaces you need five blue train cards. It really is that simple. There are some wild cards and destination cards that add a bit to the variety. but the what makes this game fun is it's simplicity. Grandparents to grand children can all sit around the table and enjoy this one. My wife and I play and she loves the fact that she can beat the snot out of me in this game."
2,"Bought this to replace a similar one I'd had for many many years.  I really liked the old one. but had repaired the handle many times & it was now beyond repair.  Wish I'd bought this one sooner!  The soft grip is wonderful. & the ridges on the working surface make it glide thru the cheese much easier; no more bogging down. no more  bunched up cheese slices.  Just a nice. wafer thin piece of cheese that does not stick to the plane when you try to take it off."
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
6,"Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar?Yes. absolutely.The top layer of material. the red layer. is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week's worth of normal use. The adhesive or bonding process isn't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad. Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin."
8,"Many of my friends say Frontline does not work against fleas or ticks in their area any more. so have switched to other flea/tick control brands.  Well. it still works for my dogs. though we really don't have many fleas where we live in the desert.  I mostly used it when we lived in an area where ticks were prevalent.  I use it on the dogs only about every 3-4 months. just in case. as I do attend dog shows. and don't want to bring any visitors home with me...  Be aware that studies show that Frontline can be detected on humans' hands weeks after applying to the dogs...so wash after petting. ( Advantage showed transfer to humans for even longer periods of time. and that is imidacloprid. so would never use that product.  )"
1,"This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)"
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
7,"I have been using this for a little while now and while it seems to work fairly well it only lasts a week without rain and if it rains you pretty much have to go out there the same day and reapply or you get to wake up first thing in the morning to your strawberries that hang near the fence being eaten...It's good idea for the most part but it's something that just doesn't really seem to be a lasting benefit and it seems to be a more natural avenue for repelling the deer and it does work just not nearly as long as I would like it to.I've been using it for a couple month on the garden/around it to keep the unwanted animals away and it does seem to work pretty good so far. just as I said. it doesn't last nearly as long as I would like it to."
11,"Got this for my nephews years ago for christmas and they loved it so much that every year they ask for another one. They love coming up with the story and then drawing all the pictures. Then once it comes in the mail they are so pleased that they made their own story they take it into school. they show everyone who comes over and they will have it for the rest of their life to show their kids. This is amazing and i love doing it every year because it shows what they liked at the time and keeps them interested in learning."
7,"I have about 5 sets of these for each hose at my house as well as my Gilmour foam gun. AR pressure washer. CR Spotless. and a couple of hose nozzles.  The brass is strong. the mechanics are crisp. and the rubber gives excellent impact protection.  The only thing you will be replacing from this equation is the o-rings every year or so. depending on use.  This set will make your life a whole lot easier. and no more struggling in trying to loosen or tighten the hose from the house."
11,"This is the slightly less complicated version of Arkham Horror. Think of it as a kind of Lovecraftian Yahtzee - you roll dice to defeat monsters and occurrences in the rooms of a museum. trying to build up a collection of 'elder signs' that can be used to seal away a great evil. It's not too difficult to win if at least one of the players knows the rules. There is plenty of replay value as there are tons of random rooms and dimensions to battle in. as well as monsters.There is also an excellent iOS version of this game that I highly recommend. too."
3,"I don't have a problem with sex scenes. even explicit ones.  I like them when there is also a story where to place them.  In this book there is sex and more sex and the story is not present at all. at least in the first half that was all I could read.  I was hoping for more substance and that is what kept me reading.  But there was only sex for sex sakes.  If you like erotica with a bit of a story then this is for you but if what you like is romance with sex in it then I don't think that you would like this book."
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
8,"My miniature schnauzer LOVES this toy. This is my second one buying (not because it broke- because it has gotten so nasty) He drags it with him EVERYWHERE. We have to make him drop this toy. The only downside is if you have hardware floors. this toy WILL scratch them so be careful... My boxer likes this toy as well but not as much because her teeth are alot smaller. I would recommend it for a dog with bigger teeth. I have noticed an improvement in his gum strength. I have had to brush his teeth less since getting this toy and he LOVES it!!! I cannot say enough how much my dog loves this toy. Also. while crate training he used to chew his bed. but once we got this toy he has not touched his bed. If we leave his toy out of his crate. his bed is chewed again........ LIFE SAVER!!!!!!!! Love Nylabone. love this dinosaur!"
12,"When this game came out. it was like a historic event.  It felt like there was no longer a limit to what video games could do.  Every toy store had a booth set up where you could give this game a try.  It was amazing to play and amazing to see.This game is still amazing.  The play control is amazingly smooth. and you can make mario do some unbelievable things.  The worlds are amazing.  You can go wherever you want to go. do whatever you want to do.Just look at the difference between this game. and the original Super Mario Bros. for NES.  My gosh. the difference is astounding.  It's amazing how Nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades.  Sometimes I love progress."
8,"My dog loves fetch and I am a huge fan of the Chuckit! launcher. however the tennis balls only seemed to last about a week tops.  The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces.  I thought this was just how life was going to be: forever buying these balls for our launcher.  Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it.  I bought a pack of 10 cheap-o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we're still using on our first ball- amazing!  It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce.  Thank you. Chuckit! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size.  I will happily buy another launcher if my current one ever wears out. but I won't waste my money on these tennis balls."
1,"During Utah's dry winters. I experience daily nose bleeds.  I've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers.  After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours. I researched other treatments.  I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel.  THIS STUFF WORKS!  I haven't had nose bleeds since using the product.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.  But two instructions for best success:1.  Put the get on the tip of the finger (not the bottom) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it. (make sure your fingernail is cut short).2.  Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible.  You want to make sure you don't gross people out.3.  I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life; no more daily bleeds!"
12,"The sequel to the very popular Tekken. Tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it. More characters. more levels. more moves. Tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover.The combat in Tekken is one of best ever. There are so many possible combinations. it's almost impossible to remember them all. Each Tekken gets better and better. Another thing I love about this game is the music. It suits the stages. and characters. well."
11,"My son is a game designer and buys games for us to play.  This is one of my favorites--I've even won a few times over my sons who are both smarter than me.  As an educator. I think it's a fun way to learn geography.  We love playing it over the holidays.  It's not too easy and not too difficult.  2 to 4 of us have played it and enjoyed it equally.  I see this Christmas my son is asking for the 1910 version. as it's on his wish list.  I want to try the Europe extension so will ask for that. This is a quality game that everyone should enjoy."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
11,"I first played this game at a Thankgiving party with a group of people ranging from 9 years old (my son) to 60's.  It's fun for everyone and challenging.  It was easy to learn with the guest who brought the game explaining as we played the first time.  Even my 9 year old picked it up quickly.So I purchased it for home and we've been playing ever since.I like that you get your own tiles and work from your own build.  Each person works on their own word puzzle.I've never gotten into Scrabble. so I'm not a wordy. but I was able to play this.This is a fast paced game that encourages vocabulary and works on spelling as well as different meanings of words.  A definate conversation starter with kids who will ask if different letter placings are words.The packaging is cute in the banana that holds the tiles.  A zipper is used to open and close it."
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
9,"My wife uses this as her camping 'kitchen' knife.  She. however. doesn't like to carry it. finding it too heavy for wearing in her hiking shorts.  It does not have a pocket clip. but comes with a belt sheath.  This should have been my first warning it was too heavy for her pocket.  Oh well. still a great addition to our gear.The unserrated blade is easy to sharpen and holds an edge well and the locking mechanism is strong and positive. The grip truly is 'all weather' as claimed. It has an excellent texture. which combined with its rubbery construction gives one a great grip even when wet."
12,"Ok. I'll admit it. I have a Gameboy of my own. 40-something mother of two. and I got one for myself so that I could play with my kids. They're great! We are all great Pokemon fans. which is how we got sucked into the whole  Gameboy thing. and those are still our favorite games.The only drawback  that I find with the thing is that it does need to be well-illuminated.  otherwise you'll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen. But  that aside. these babies are fun! My kids love them. I love mine. great fun  all around. Go for it!"
12,"If you like racing games that are unique. this is for you. You can race by yourself. or with a friend. Not only that. but you can also challenge your friends in battle mode with some really fun arenas. If your more of a solo player like me. don't worry. there are four different tournaments that you can play.You can even use different items either to slow down the other racers. or to help you pass them up. Of course every item has it's own effects. there are a few that are hard to get. That's because they're special. learn how to use them. and the competition will be eating your dust.And last. but far from least. there is a special mode you can unlock for an even bigger challenge. Yeah. this game will keep you busy no matter how you play. It's definately a must-have. order it while you can."
4,"I was a huge fan of exploitation cinema back in the day. So I was a bit disappointed when I could not remember ever seeing this 'classic'. And I am even more disappointed for having seen it now. It's not going to win awards (not even Razzies) and everything screams 'tacky'. but I guess I'm just mellowing with age. Not for serious fans of realistic cinema or quality films. but certainly for people who enjoy their guilty little delights. I'm just not of those people anymore. I guess."
12,"I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal."
7,"Sure. this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose. but NEVER SAY NEVER!!!  It's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends. but it WILL kink.  Keep in mind if you're using a hose in colder weather. rubber is the only way to go.  These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they're stored.  They're awesome in warmer climates though!Overall we're happy with the hose. but believe it shouldn't claim that it'll &#34;Never Kink&#34;."
2,"I absolutely love this book! Before purchasing. I found myself gathering bits and pieces of information from the wilton site to make the flowers and borders that I wanted. but this book puts them all together neatly without leaving anything out. I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful. but so much of it is advanced. and I'm just not there. I only decorate for fun. This book sticks to basics which. for me. is essential to focus. If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious. Then I end up giving up. So. with this book I can actually follow the process and learn step by step without the frustration.The only small disappointment was the weight of the cover. The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well. Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though. so no big deal."
2,"It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars. I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value. As some reviewers have pointed out. much of the book focuses on advertising Wilton products; without all of this the useful material in the book could have been condensed down to a couple of pages. I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses. I had initially planned on getting the subsequent lesson plans as well. but I don't think it will be worth it. If you have any skill/experience with cake decorating at all. I'd recommend skipping this book."
9,"I own several brands of Multi-tools. SOG. Gerber. Leatherman and now Victorinox. Nothing against the other brands. they are each very good in their own right. but this tool is nothing less than the Swiss perfection that you would expect from Victorinox. The pliers are very smooth and not stiff like the other brands (with exception to the spring assisted Gerber EVO or Butterfly). And the accessories are the easiest of all brands to open. they work just as smooth as opening up any Victorinox knife. and I might add they are also just as sharp. The only thing that could make this better is the opening of the pliers; I have yet to find any multi-tool that opens as smooth and as easy as the gear driven SOG PowerLock. Just my $0.02.....!!! I highly recommend the RS and would definitely buy this one again."
1,"I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally. plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit.  Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon.  But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush. but it is also very hard to find in stores.  The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top.  It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain.  The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house.  Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this. and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best. and highly recommended..."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
1,"I've been a pack a day smoker for 40 years now and I just gotta kick this stupid habit. Been using these every day for the past six weeks now and have not yet smoked a cigarette in that time. I think that at this point it might just be psychological. but I'm still tempted to head over to 7-11 and buy a pack. so I keep putting on a 21 mg patch every morning and continue to tell myself how disgusting it would be if I start smoking again. Still taking it minute by minute and day by day. but I never could be doing this without the aid of the NicoDerm patches."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
1,"If you have high LDL cholesterol and you have not been able to reduce it with diet and exercise. this Slo-Niacin tablets will do the job. The slow release minimizes flashing that is normally associated with Niacin and the results are incredible. I have been trying to lower my Cholesterol for the last couple of years but with no success. I was stuck in the range of 230-235 and even though I was taking Flash-Free Niacin. my number was not dropping. Two months ago I found out by reading posts on the Internet that Flash-Free Niacin does not work for lowering cholesterol. So. I started looking for another way and found the Slo-Niacin which is regular niacin that is released slowly. This worked great. I took 1500 mg a day for a month and my cholesterol dropped from 233 to 130.  I was shocked by how well it worked.  It makes you wonder why doctors prescribe drugs when a natural supplement like Niacin works so well."
1,"I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.Best of all. it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the 'normal' light is on. or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job..."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
11,"I've been playing Scrabble for years. and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago. I really like it! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously. it's a very fast-paced. energetic game. Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group. Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes. if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something. they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways. the game is more accessible than Scrabble. A good vocabulary still helps a lot. as does a good familiarity with two-letter words. but knowledge of really esoteric long words isn't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble. They're two completely different games. and I still do enjoy Scrabble. but I'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well. There's a time and a place for both."
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
10,"I am always trying to buy American made products when I can but every once in a while something so good gets imported that even I have to buy it. These discs are an example. Made in Finland. I was using 3M gold discs on a fender sanding down some paint and there was a little rust on it also. The 3M was doing decent job but then I put these on and it was literally night and day difference. These cut literally 2 times as fast even though are the same grit I am not sure how it is possible but the proof is in the pudding. Lasted longer also. Will definitely buy again."
6,"I use paper cutters primarily for origami. where getting straight and accurate cuts is CRITICAL. Unfortunately it's very hard to get them correct with this trimmer. First. the guides are relatively wide compared to other cutters. so it's hard to know where precisely to line the paper up. The other issue is that the guide in the middle of the cutter is further down on this larger size than on the smaller model. This makes is much more difficult to line paper up if you are cutting to sizes of around 6 inches or less. which I very often am (cutting 12x12 scrapbook paper to 6x6). It doesn't handle multiple sheets particularly well. I could do about 3 or 4 before I started having issues. but it's the accuracy of it that is the biggest issue for me personally. If you don't need perfect cuts though it's a good enough trimmer and certainly will do the trick for photo use and other less critical jobs."
7,"This is a high quality food grade DE and is labeled as such .  Believe it is the finest powder I have ever purchased and is rated the purest I have found .  My wife and I use it internally. plus I use it on the yard. under my home. garden and my large dog pens .  It works well in my Dustin Miser (sold on Amazon) . producing a very fine cloud of DE dust .  Because it is a very fine powder it coats things well and kills ticks. fleas. Colorado potato bug larva. most ants. and even most hard shell pests . People don't think DE will kill hard shell pests but even they have connecting membranes between the hard shell parts. and legs that can be damaged or cut . This product was shipped FAST and I highly recommend it and this seller to anyone ."
7,"I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black. rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking. the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish. steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g.. hamburgers. hotdogs. etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food. while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on. The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range. You can't go wrong!"
1,"I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon. I loved the wondfu tests and  left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was. obviously. heartbreaking. I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead. Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well.  I'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days. I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today!! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results."
10,"I have been buying this glue in this exact quantity for years now and I am here to say that it is an absolutely great performer.  Though I have used polyurethane glues and epoxy (I have yet to try the new Titebond III). this Titebond II is the glue I turn to 99% of the time.  It has never let me down in any application - I build mainly indoor furniture and jigs.Once cured. the strength of this glue is consistently stronger than the wood around it.  I have had good luck with letting it dry and scraping the squeeze-out away with a sharp chisel and/or a flexible putty knife.  After sanding I have had no problems with splotchiness in finishes.I made the mistake of buying too much of this glue at once a few years ago and learned the lesson that it will go bad over time.  Now I always buy this glue in these bottles and never have problems.Highly recommended!"
6,"Haven't used Avery labels for quite some time; however. since i recently became treasurer of our HOA. it's my duty to mail dues requests twice a year - labeling envelopes is never fun. but decided to try these labels... in the past. picking the label off the sheet was a wearisome. repetitive task... but now. with Avery's redesign of its label sheets. a quick two folds of the printed sheet of labels. and label edges pop up - making the job of peel-and-place a *lot* easier! Good job. Avery!"
6,"The satin finish is supposed to make this more invisible than regular 'Magic' tape when used on gift wrap.  To my eyes. there is almost no difference.  So the only reason to get this is if the price is better than regular 'Magic' tape.  As I write this review. it is!To be clear. there's nothing WRONG with this tape.  It works just as well as regular 'Magic' tape.  It's very hard to see when applied.  And. I assume. it'll have the same remarkable durability as regular 'Magic' tape.  It's just that it's special feature (satin finish. more invisible on gift wrap) doesn't work."
2,"I bought the 12&#34; size 6 years ago and they are still serving me well. I just bought the 16&#34; & 9&#34; sizes for almost $30 and if they are as good as the older 12&#34; ones. I'm OK with spending that coin. They are easy to clean. do not rust. and the locking mechanism is super nice! Cheap tongs with that cheesy metal slide annoy me to no end as they enviably slide down and lock the tongs when I need to pick something up. Spontaneous locking is not a problem with these."
4,"I am not Christian. But I read bible many times and saw many movies to know the life of Jesus Christ. After thinking of Christ many times. his life and kindness influenced me a lot. Unknowingly I started keeping him in my heart always. He gives me peace. love and compassion. He shows the way of life to one and many.When I bought this DVD. I could not wait to reach home to see this outstanding breath taking depiction of the last part of his life. I loved the possible reality that has been shown and understood the human cruality/apathy very well even though I hated the strong violence in any form. But Jesus Christ's mission is truely accomplished and he is in hearts of the majority of the world. In my opinion. the life of Jesus Christ as depicted here makes more interesting and reaches more millions."
1,"I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better. It's like my mustache is learning to form a curl on both sides. This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold. It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit. It washes out very easily my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i'm greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product. So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch."
1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
1,"This is a great price for batteries. you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon!  These little LR44's are found in so many of my children's toys. the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk. Tinkerbell that glows. Christmas ornaments. even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store.  I have ordered these twice now. because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery.  It's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time!  They also work well and last. too.  Stock up HERE!!"
10,"Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs."
10,"Well. I have yet to buy a DeWalt tool that I haven't been happy with. and this saw is no exception.  This saw makes consistent cuts and has a ton of great features.  I would make two suggestions when buying it that some people may overlook:First. I would buy a quality blade for use with your intended projects rather than the one included (it cuts. but as with most blades included with saws. probably isn't going to satisfy your needs)Second. I would strongly suggest picking up the optional rip fence (DW3278).  You can usually find it up for around $10.00. and it makes long straight cuts infinitely easier.  Definitely a good investment!Nevertheless. I am extremely happy with this saw.  THe only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the included accessories (and lack of an included rip fence)."
3,"So maybe I have read too many m&eacute;nage stories but this just story just did not work for me. I realize it is a short story so not a lot of character development or background but to me Cassie just came off as kinda whiny and wimpy....yes you're in love with your two best friends. and yes. you see them getting it on. you obviously were not that good of friends if you ran off with no explanation or confronting them about it (or maybe I am expecting the character to do what I would do which is call them on it...not that I have ever been in love with two people equally or at the same time....) so while I normally like this author this one just did not do it for me. I guess I like my heroines a bit stronger...."
6,"When you need a phone during an emergency or power outage. when you want a phone that is reliably located on the 'base' where someone hasn't walked away with the handset. this is the IDEAL phone! The phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack.  If you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord.  I like this! It's nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind! The phone comes with pulse and tone dialing (needed to use computerized dialing.)"
4,"I was raised Catholic and still am a Catholic as I go to mass now ever Sunday even though I didnt go for awhile in my early 20's. I left the theater feeling like a bad Mary Magedeline. It was a great movie though but not great that you want to watch it over and over. The androgynous Satan was really creepy. I felt like the bad Catholic that I have been after watching this. As a kid I used to like going to 'The stations of the cross' events at the church during Easter but this is so graphic all it did was make me feel like a bad Catholic and that I need to go to confession really bad."
12,"This is a great game to own I have and I beaten It  ten times and I sill play it the level's are pretty to look at the background's are ok it's colorful and a little rich here and there.Play through five world's there are:1 South Pacific2 Antarctica3 Area 514 London5 IndiaNew Moves. and Vehicles:Speed Dash.

1,"After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee. a dentist recommended this product. both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above. this product is recommended (by 'dental professionals!')for canker sores. gum irritations. denture & mouth sores. orthodontic irritations. mouth burns. and cheek bites (I'm not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little. and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional."
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
10,"This tool performs very well. It sands very quickly. Faster than my Dewalt and Porter Cable palm grip R/O sanders. The variable speed is very useful for sanding face frames on cabinets or other tricky spots. The dust  collection works O.K. A shop vac helps a lot though. The only problem is  that some times the pad comes unthreaded from the mechanism and flies off.  Maybe some thread lock would help. I'm not alone with this problem. I saw  others' comments posted on Bosch's chat room about this. Don't let that  stop you from getting an otherwise good tool. Just periodically check the  screw on the pad."
8,"Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV.  It is a great ramp. easy to use. very sturdy. a cinch to unfold and very lightweight.  The tread is very good and provides for sure footing.  We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight.  It is plastic. so being outside doesn't hurt it and the water runs right off it.  I am really happy with it."
3,"This book has a good basic storyline.  However. I found the writing to be of a rather jerky and staccato style. especially in the descriptive areas.  It was rather difficult to follow at times as it jumps around a bit and with the formatting problems (quite a few) I found myself trying to figure out where I was in the story. It took me longer to read than it should have because of that. Reformatting would definitely help you keep track of what is happening. I did feel that there were a few things that could have been left out of the story as they really weren't incorporated into the storyline very well. just seemed to be thrown in because you have to be explicit about some things (x-rated).  Thank goodness for the fast page turnings on the Kindle! Even with all this. I still wanted to keep reading to find out what happened."
4,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE KID'S VIDEO.  We originally borrowed this from the library.  We liked it so much. and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again. that we decided to buy it.  The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time.  I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months. but it still holds their interest.  The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers.  We all sing along and. quite frankly. I can't get the songs for the numbers 3. 5. and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD."
2,"This scoop has a comfortable handle and a good shape for attacking hard ice cream straight out of the freezer. The chrome finish is attractive and seems like it would be more durable and dishwasher-safe than the ridiculous (and unnecessary) non-stick finish I have on my other Oxo scoopOXO Good Grips 26481 Nonstick Beak Ice Cream Scoop. I prefer to dip this in water before use (so it will glide through the ice cream). and to wash it by hand afterward. This isn't an all-metal scoop. like theOXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop. so I'm a little concerned about its longevity."
4,"Actually. I would give this two scores--a 3 for those already familiar with Gettysburg and a 4 for those not. I can't give a score of 3.5. so I have rounded to 4 stars.For those familiar with the battle. little will be gained by viewing this--other than the very welcome bird's eye view of the battlefield. For instance. the coverage of Pickett's charge doesn't mention the involvement of Trimble's and Pettigrew's forces on the third day.For those not so familiar with Gettysburg. this will be a good introduction. A lot of details are left out. but the basics--from Buford's stand on Day One to &#34;Pickett's Charge&#34; on Day Three--are presented. The stories of Wesley Culp and Jennie Wade provide a certain poignancy to the DVD.So. nice cinematography. a plus. Basic description of the battle--a plus for neophytes and not so much for those familiar with the battle."
8,"Bought used - opted for this version of a ramp for my pack of aging herding dogs - 50 # Aussie/BCs and a 75# Bouvier des Flandres - who were beginning to tear my aging back. Made in USA from  heavy duty plastic by the same folks who made the floor mats I got for the truck (Weather Tek). Folds easily. The weight is necessary for the sturdiness I need (plan to throw in the truck bed when not being used). No metal to rust. Textured ramp built in (no peeling). Altogether the ramp is an ideal product I was very pleased to buy at 60% retail cost."
7,"I bought these a year ago but hadn't used them much.  I just began using them this spring and loved them - would have given them five stars until today.  Ironically I just ordered another pair yesterday because they are so easy to use - lightweight and sharp.But today the orange clamp that keeps them closed when not in use no longer does its job and they stay open all the time which makes them bulkier to carry as they are much less compact with both blades and handles splaying out.  That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79. They are VERY useful - I just wish they were sturdier."
3,"I am not one to give bad reviews but I could not get into this book.  The sex was hot.  I am not too into m/m sex but in this book it wasn't bad.  you could actually feel for both men.  But Cassie's character I did not like.  She comes into town after being engaged for 10 months and within 5 mins is having sex with Kyle & she was pretty much the one making it happen.  I did not like all her self doubts.  I guess the last chapter was the best in the book.  So all & all it was an okay read but not happy I spent money on it."
4,"People who don't like it because of the gore. Let me tell you something. The gore scenes in this film are extremley grade school compared to the way it really happened. There has never been or ever will be a civilization as decadent and barbaric as the roman empire. They were masters of torture and what the Jesus Christ suffered in this film was nothing even close to what the real Jesus Christ endured for us so we wouldn't have to go to Hell. The Non Christian who watches this film can not truly appreciate the love Jesus had for us going to the cross like the Christian can. Watch it not the gore scenes. You want to see gore watch Dawn Of The Dead or The Burning Moon. You want a true love story watch this film."
10,"While remodeling my home. we were taking up the floor boards on the second floor. so we could access the electric to the first floor ceiling fans.  The house is old and still had gas pipe in the floors from the old 'gas lighting'. and to add to the confusion it still had the knob and tube wiring.  Needless to say it was tight working between the joists.  Thats were the DeWalt DW160 came in....it fit down inbetween the joists nicely. and had enough power to get the job done.  As mentioned in another review. and keyless chuck would have been great. but other than that this drill is a great thing to have around."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
1,"This is a weird sort of &#34;goo&#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded. but it's a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &#34;fine-tuning&#34; a temporary reline kit. but DON'T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn't stick to the gums AT ALL."
11,"My daughter. (who is now 8 years old). received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times. and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read. and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book. very fun."
6,"This HP Multipurpose Copy/Laser/Inkjet with 96 Brightness. I was so glad to find in a local store last week. So I have been printing letters. forms. misc type of documents on it and am amazed the brightness of the paper for such a reasonable price! And since I have an HP Printer. I am glad to have paper with HP's endorsement (on the back of the wrapping for this paper. it states that it was actually made by International Paper Company under license of HP). So this paper is made for HP and other quality types of printers. whether HP or another brand.So glad I am using this paper now as in the past. I paid for the generic and cheap types of paper that a brightness of about 88. which is not that good when it is compared to 96 brightness. And the old generic paper cost the same price as this high quality paper.For the cost of this product and the quality. this is in my opinion a BEST BUY!"
12,"Extremely difficult to play unless you're an expert. Great graphics. Problem with this video game is that it does get old after maybe an hour or so. Many levels to conquer. I'd only recommend this game to those who have plenty of patience. You know. the SAME kind of patience you need to have while on Ebay just waiting for a posted item's time to run out while them other 'have no-life' buyers often snipe the item YOU wanted SO badly in the last fifteen seconds. That kind of patience."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection. or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great."
11,"Take my review with a grain of salt since I haven't played through a whole campaign but what I do know is- A lot of minis and a variety of them. Don't let the red/white scheme scare you away- Lots of good quality cardboard and cards. Colorful art.- Essentially a tactical miniatures fantasy game of 1 vs 2-4- Meant to be played as a campaign and requires a dedicated group of consistent gamers- Fair amount of setup time needed. but well worth it.- Not a dungeon crawl / exploration since both sides have goals to pursue.- Lots of small and large expansions which can use up your savings but do not require any expansions to have a good game.If you are okay with all of the above then this game is for you."
10,"I have had the 690 Porter Cable router for years and finally committed that one to a table. This is the same motor (without the speed control) but with the 'D' handle. Loads of power. really convienent to use. I find that I don't use the speed control all that much. Woodcraft offered the Porter Cable 892 kit as a replacement for this one. The guy said that Porter Cable quit making these. But this one is half the price and actually meant to be used one handed. A fine tool. BTW they still make it."
8,"I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly. because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately. the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison. but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward. I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones."
7,"I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinklerPros: Solid build. strong material construction. quick performer. very easy to adjust the spray pattern.Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price. I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird. youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one."
8,"my dog like his kibbles more than treats (he LOVES to eat!!). and with this sprinkled on top of his food.he refuses to eat. the smell is super strong even I pull away my head when I open the jar.And. even when i hand fed him the food. he still tried to play with his poop.  (granted. he consumed smaller portion than the recommended by the direction)Overall. it may keep dogs away from their poop because they can smell this in their poop. but that same smell is present on their food. which obviously repells them.So. I do not recommend this product unless your dog eats EVERYTHING."
12,"I saw this game. and it looked amusing. so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun. and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer. 12 or older. rent this game. but do not buy. Most 11 year olds. and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that. you'll go ape over this game."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
10,".One very usefull little trim saw! Worm drive works very well and seems to handle anything lite. You can not cut a 2x4 with this so don't buy it thinking you can.The only thing porter cable should have done with it is to have provided a box for it. It was designed way back in the 30's or 40's and to this date 2007. they still do not have a box???....A Shame!The saw is much to easy to break or bend if not placed in some kind of case when transporting it. The size of this saw makes it very hard to find just the right size as well....But we have to give the tool itself 5 star because it works very very well!A bit on the 'To high priced side' with out a storage however!"
10,"Still looking for the 'dimmable' option--only found the on/off switch. But essentially the same light as the 'table' model. very bright yet only 3W used. Has a clamp instead of a weighted base. capable of attaching to a table or headboard no larger than 1 and 1/4 in thick. Only assembly req'd was plugging cord into plug. Same perfect black paint as table model. but cannot change bulb--permanent. so must toss entire unit if it ever burns out! Advertised @ 20K hours! We'll see...&#128521;"
11,"I've owned this game for a couple years now and must say it is a great game with good strategy and re-playability.  The graphics and card quality as usual with Fantasy Flight Games is excellent.  The only drawback is that with the cards having a black boarder they are showing some wear and tear with color fading. but as i said I have owned it for a few years and has been in the rotation of the regular games we play that whole time. Overall definitely a card game I would recommend."
3,"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband. a twin. has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still. they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover. jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple. It's just a short story. however."
11,"A great family game of storytelling that will keep people amused and stimulate the imagination.The artwork is excellent and whimsical. The components are solid.This game board is a revised edition that goes up to 6 players. There are some improvements. The instructions are now pretty clear from box to board not really requiring combing into the rule book making it quite easy to jump in.There's another version that goes up to 12 players. but all that people voting is overkill and hard to track. 6 is enough."
7,"I have used this to help germinate some cucumbers I started indoors in a small greenhouse tent. At night when the grow lights are unplugged the inside get fairly chilly like the rest of the house. but with this heat mat I can leave it on all night and not have to worry about the seedlings. I would say it keeps the inside temperatures a good 10 degrees warmer than without it. I found the cord to be a little short but it's really no big deal. Before purchasing I compared this with the ones for sale on Gardener's Supply and this seemed to be much better value for the size."
1,"OK. so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store.  Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name. so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results.  I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands. but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again"
12,"This game does not. in fact. star Superman. It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman. Stuporman staggers like a drunken person. relies on power-ups for super powers. pulls punches so enemies beat him. likes random time limits (including ones that lead to an instant game over). can pass through solid objects like they aren't even there. and can die from things that cannot hurt the real man of steel in a million years. like ordinary bullets and explosions. He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Superman's reputation by making him look pathetic and weak. All part of Lex Luthor's evil plan! If you love Superman. don't buy this game. or you'll be buying into a lie!"
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
3,"I liked this one. It wasn't all about the sexy times together. It was really more of a story. which I enjoyed.Christina doesn't trust men. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her brother turned out exactly the same. So. she left but it's left her scarred. She wished more than anything her mother would leave. and can't understand why she doesn't. You sort of knew what was going to happen but it was a bit more surprising than that.I liked it. It was sexy. sweet. and enjoyable."
7,"Over the years I have tried a number of flower pot holders and have always been disappointed with the quality of them. This flower pot holder is made of strong and sturdy steel that is vinyl coated and rust proof so I don't have to worry about rust stains on my deck rails or the holder hanging crooked because of the flower pot weight. It can hold up to 10' flower pots or even several small flower pots so it has great versatility. It was easy to install and looks simple. yet gorgeous. The only thing I didn't like was having to drill my new deck to install the flower pot holder. Overall. it's a great item that's a cut above the rest."
2,"For years. hubby and I have bought Lasko fans to keep in our bedroom.  This is our third one.We use it to keep the air circulating and for the white noise to help me sleep.None of the three that we've owned have had any whining. squeaking. rattling or weird noises.  Just a nice. smooth hum.It does blow hard.The first one died because I let it get too dusty.  The second one lasted for 7 years and I only replaced it because my son needed a fan and I wanted a shiny new one for myself."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
1,"I've been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers' sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered. I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips. as pictured. The wires are pretty weak. and easily bent. but that's unavoidable if it's going to fit into tight spaces. They're supposed to be changed weekly. and I can generally get a week's worth of use out of one. despite having some teeth that are both very close. and slightly crooked. so it's a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces. and the cylindrical one at the other end."
12,"not worth 10 cents. graphics are very poor for nintendo 64 The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick. The aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die. Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring. After level 2 there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it. A much better version of this is availible on the ps1 . definately dont waste any money on this game. it down right sucks"
3,"This book starts off a bit hesitantly--it's the first of a couple dealing with Kasey Johnson and his twin brother Garrett. but it heats up incredibly fast and in such a way as your initial reaction might be. &#34;um. whaaaaaaat?&#34;  Kasey is a second-year professional basketball player obviously playing for the Phoenix Suns--he's a 6'5&#34; blond god who is gay and has not come out. though his equally impressive brother. Garrett. a rising movie star. is openly gay.  There are so many &#34;this is absurd&#34; twists that this book takes which are dealt with brilliantly by author Chase that you actually believe that this stuff can happen. especially today.  You will not forget these characters. including Kasey's devoted seducer and eventually lover. Gram. and you will run right out and get its sequel. High Line. featuring Garrett. as soon as you finish this full court press."
3,"Just finished reading all of Kava's books; they were very good!  I am not a book critic; but what I can say is the entire lot of her books were entertaining and held my interest.  Anytime I pick up a book and read instead of doing something else in my free time is saying something!  Kava. Garnder. Gerritssen. Gagnon what a list of great reads for anyone that enjoys these types of stories....And the bundle provieds the ability to acquire six of her books for a good price!"
6,"The key claim of these labels is that when you are ready to 'peel and stick' them after printing. they are easier to peel off of the backing (the slick sheet that they come on) than other brands are. It's true -- they have simply removed a little bit of paper between each column of labels so that you can fold back the backing paper and easily grasp the edge of each label.If you find existing labels easy to peel off. as I do. there's no reason to get these labels. But if you have to handle hundreds or thousands of labels in a row. the little extra convenience may be worth it.I rated them 4 stars rather than 5 stars only because there is nothing amazing about them."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
10,"I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber. and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly. and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down.  Iuse the optional sanding frame. and a vacuum hose. so thebag placement is not an issue for me.  Using the sanding frame.you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly.  Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you're good to go.This beast is heavy.  Unless you're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI wouldn't consider using this on vertical surfaces.  Onhorizontal surfaces. gravity is your friend. and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools.  Most are good. a few are crappy.a few are excellent.  With this sander. every time I use it.I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $$$ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself."
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
6,"We've been using those oil-filled sheets that you run through the shredder every so often to lube it up. I found this. at a much. much lower cost. and figured I'd give it a shot. expecting a small bottle of oil similar to ones I've seen at the store. Nope. This is a full-size. 12 oz bottle. which is a LOT of shredder oil. at least for our home use. I figure it will last at least a year. and likely 2-3.Careful cutting off the tip - it's just like a tube of caulk. and if you cut off too much. you'll have a hard time controlling it. Other than that. it's easy to apply. with a nice long nozzle. flows easily. and works great."
12,"This Zelda game is simply amazing! The Wind Waker sucked and Four Swords was OK. but this game rocks! The main plot was spectacular and the gameplay was great! I first played the game after getting Collector's Edition for Christmas. and I was addicted to it. The main plot throughout the whole game is that Link(as a kid) must collect 3 Spiritual stones and open the Door of Time. along with the Ocarina of Time. As an adult. Link must awaken the 5 sages and fight to destroy the evil Ganondorf and rescue Zelda. I have beaten the game 6 times it was so good! I highly recommend it to big Zelda fans. NOTE: This game has a sequel called Majora's Mask. but it's not near as good in my opinion."
8,"the price and size were right to donate to humane society. My cats have refused to switch to purina or whiskas from Blue buffalo. I was seeking to reduce costs but just knew when I saw the big bag that there was no way my cats would eat it.  I had thought it was fancy feast...white cat...gourmet...so when I realized its just a cheaper brand than even the purina ....well. As a donation though it helps Im sure.. The dogs will eat it if the cats wont..at my place the racoons get whatever the cats reject."
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
12,"Street Alpha 3 really rocked in the Arcades and when they brough it to the homes of millions on the PSone. it still rocked. it looked great and of course how could you forget the many characters you had to choose from. In total (I want to say) 34 or 35? total characters including hidden characters. A definite up scale from the original Street Fighter Alpha where there's only 8 or 10 characters and 2 of which you could've easily done without (Sodom and Birdie).Also in this one. the special moves changed because now you got to chose which set you wanted which was cool for some characters and detrimental to the success of some of the other characters.I'd still definately get this one because it's that good and even so. how could you not continue to collect the Street Fighter series? PLEASE! You know you want to so go ahead and get it!"
2,"I had never in my life had homemade ice cream until now. my husband and I bought this as a Christmas present to the both of us. we have everything else you can think of but never an ice cream maker. well we are so impressed with the ice cream we can't wait to try other types. It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had. and this machine makes it so easy to make. just pour in the ingredients and turn it on. set a timer and you can relax. when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever! Try it. you will love it!"
8,"I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now. tending to get a couple of years of use out of them.  For the price. the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump. it seems reasonable to me.  I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow. is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it.  Those are its pros. along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes).  However. I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning. which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so)."
3,"'SPOILERS'I just got done reading all three books in the Vaughn series that are currently available and enjoyed all three of them.  My main issue with this one however is how quickly Candice gets over her experience of being raped...in one weekend she goes from barely being able to cope with talking to people at the gym. to sleeping with the hero...and it just seems as though it moves a bit too quickly...but the book was a good read and i'm eagerly awaiting the next one in the series due out early next year about their cousin Grace"
8,"Wanted to try on my own to get rid a my cat's tapeworm. I had seen the white pieces of the worm on her rectum. It was 3 pills.  The first one was wasted. mainly my fault.  The second one was given in a really good treat.  I think she ate most of it.  Have not seen any tell-tell signs on her rectum since then so I am assuming it worked.  The delivery was very fast.  I will use them again."
2,"I ordered this lesson plan because I took the first two courses of Wilton's Cake Decorating. and I didn't want to sign up for the 3rd course only because I didn't want to spend so much money for the classes. So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan wasn't included in kit like the first 2 kits were. This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you. no pun intended. But this definitely isn't for a beginner."
12,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer. Naughty Dog had a great idea. and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay. the graphics. the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds. such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!"
1,"These are expensive for daily use. I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that. but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter. digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be. with very gradual storage loss. great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not."
11,"My 11 yo nephew was wide-eyed as he dramatically told me how it was &#34;proven&#34; that the elf moved. etc.  After that. I couldn't not buy it for him for Christmas.  He was so excited when he opened it!  I read through the book (which I thought was pretty goofy. but if the kids like it. then who am I to judge?) and it at least explained the whole concept.  I know many people think that this elf idea is creepy. but I have seen so many who have had fun with it. too.  It seemed to be well made. and the boxed-set made it a wonderful presentation for gift-giving."
8,"Program is the safest long lasting flea treatment for pets-- I used to work in a veterinary hospital and I have seen many cats have serious reactions to  Advantage and Frontline. which are topical pesticides.Read the inserts for Advantage and Frontline. it says that they are NOT safe for sick animals. young kittens. etc. etc. My cat is allergic to both Frontline and Advantage. Frontline gave him a lump in his neck and Advantage gave him a bald spot where I applied it. and he kept trying to lick the spot.Program is super safe-- you can put it in a dish and mix it with tuna and your cat will eat it right up. You can use it with Capstar (also super safe. but not long lasting) to kill live fleas if your cat picks one up. This is the best monthly flea control to keep your cat safe and healthy! I have used it for almost a decade and I will not use any other product on my cat."
12,"If you own the N64 then you must have this game. The graphics are a bit out dated. but who cares! The game is still great! Even though there are less characters than the newer smash bros this game still brings in the punches. You can play story/one player mode and also play up to 4 people.In one player mode you can either do the story mode or do the challenges. Both are fun! You can set up the difficulties and also set up how many lives you can use.Multiplayer mode is also fun. You have the ability to play in teams or not. Still you can set up the difficulties. PLUS. you can have a time battle or set up how many lives you can use.Though unlike mele you can't plat story mode with 2 players... but that shouldn't be the reason for not getting this game!"
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
12,"This isn't a particularly deep product. They are wire extenders to be used for the Nintendo Gamecube controllers. They come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price. They extend approximately 6 feet in length. and with the already fairly long wire on the Gamecube controller already. these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room. I have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller. Getting these beats paying the higher price for the Wavebird wireless Gamecube controllers. I'm on a budget so I'll just stick with a wired controller. no big deal."
2,"From now on. I'll always look for a Lasko 3733 when I need to replace a fan. I bought my first one 5 years ago and it ran 24/7 365 days a year. It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out. FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced. It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like. but then again. I want perfection and that's not going to happen. It  is quiet enough on the slow setting. and making a fan spin faster does nothing to move air faster (believe it or don't. this is pure physics).Cleaning of this fan is very easy. Simply remove the grill screws. then remove the grills. Then unscrew the blade holder. and pull the blades off the spindle. Wash in hot. soapy water. Replace everything. then turn it on so that it drys itself."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
11,"Arkham Horror is a hard game to win. but it is a lot of fun! It can also be quite long. Adding expansions adds to the fun. especially more monsters. investigators. items and spells. Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used. however. This is a neat game. as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator's power. defeating monsters. and closing gates (which spew forth more monsters if you don't close them). Meanwhile. a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It'!This is a very cool game."
5,"I actually have five of these for the various instruments. mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric.When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very. very solid. While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners. I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength. You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete. and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model.The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic. There are variants for other instruments. but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable. and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully."
1,"These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old. and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time. so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life. I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy."
10,"I purchased the plane even after reading the bad reviews. I have own many Stanley planes some antiques and son giving to me by my grandfather. I have always been very happy with them. So. I purchased this rabbet planer with the purpose of cleaning up the middle ridge made by a dado. When I first got the plane. like you need to do with all planes. I tuned it and adjusted it. The plane works great. I have been using it with no problems. It did take a bit of time to adjust. If you are not sure on how to adjust the plane or the tuning of it. you can e-mail Stanley's service department and they will be glade to mail out the information on the model you have. I would and more then likely will purchase other Stanley plane in the future. I gave this four stars because nothing is perfect."
8,"This product has better ingredients at a better price than some lesser quality foods. I'm still debating making my own dog food. They suggest not giving dogs table food. but cheaper dog food typically costs $1/pound. I have a difficult time purchasing food for my family that's $1/pound (we eat A LOT of chicken for that reason). Chicken is currently $0.49/pound. Homemade dog food is looking very cost effective these days. Either way. apples to apples. this is a reasonable purchase. It doesn't cause my dog flatulence like some other brands."
10,"Freud SS100 Dado Shim SetThis product does what it says it does. Is it really necessary? Probably not. In order to size a dado precisely. you measure to approximate the set of dado blades used to the desired width. Then you start cutting test grooves in scrap stock and adding or change shim thicknesses and cutting another test. Depending on your skill and luck. you may get it right in several tries.It is just as effective to select the dado blade set. with no shims.  for a groove a little undersize. Then make a slight rabbet cut on the inserted board (shelf) to fit the dado. like fitting a tenon to a mortise. Use a piloted rabbet bit in a router to make the fitting cut. Once adjusted to depth. you can repeat the process accurately as many times as the project requires.I bought the shim set because I thought I was missing something. but I probably will not use it much."
11,"I purchased this game as a kind of &#34;D&D; in-a-box&#34; purchase to play with friends. and it was a big hit.Pros:Lots of characters and class options-The adventures are fun and engaging-Easy to learn-Excellent miniatures and artCons:-Fairly basic as far as gameplay goes. not alot of thought involved.-Campaigns are artificially stretched by the &#34;reinforcement&#34; mechanic that lets you constantly add more enemies to the stage-Requires someone to be the &#34;overlord&#34; which no one wants to be."
8,"I really like this launcher.  It works really well. but I'm thinking of someday buying the longer one.  I opted on this one as the long one indicated it threw farther.  I didn't want to launch it so far I'd lose the ball or end up chasing my dog to get him to come back. so for the length of the throw is perfect and it's very easy to snatch the ball up for continued throwing.  My significant other is 6'1&#34; so he has to do some bending to pick up the balls which is okay for him. but the intention had been to make it easier for him.  One thing I've noticed is that this does not put the stress on my shoulder that thowing by hand thowing does.  This makes our dog. Diego. very happy because he can play and play and play."
7,"This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards'.  When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own. particularly Eastern Cardinals. Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole. You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism. Will keep out at least 90% of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder."
7,"CobraCo's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across.  The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail.  There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down.  There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level.  The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck.  Just add plant. and water."
11,"Robots will no doubt become a big part of society. they will do tasks that we deem to be too dangerous or Dirty and the ReCon 6.0 is a very good toy to get your kids started in learning how to program Robots and see the results of their efforts.  I would recommend this for children between the ages of 8-12 years old because it does require a certain amount of discipline in math. problem solving. spatial awareness and programming so it's win win toy!My only complaints would be the lack of a Remote control. it would be nicer if the code could be edited without accessing the Robot at ground level and it would be nice if it also moved a little faster.Overall I find this to be an extremely educational toy that will make a child more interested in what is sure to be a huge job market area in the next 20 years."
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
10,"This toolbox is made of solid metal. which is pretty nice because plastic stuff breaks eventually.  This thing feels solid.  It has a nice top drawer that you can pull out.  I use this as my toolbox between going between my two houses. I keep a small cordless drill and its charger. some caulk. a level. a hammer. drill bit set. safety goggles. utility blade. small flashlight. tape measure. a bunch of screws and nails of various lengths and maybe a few other small things that I'm forgetting (ahh. pliers and a couple of screwdrivers).  It is a little bit of an exercise to get all of this into this relatively small tool box. but I actually like the small size of it.  Easy to pack into the car. sturdy. etc.  For the simple user. it is perfect.  If you're a pro. you probably need one of the metal boxes with drawers."
3,"This book was a recent Kindle Daily Deal and I decided to take a flyer on it. While I like anthologies. ones as topical as this one aren't what I usually read. So I had my doubts about how I'd like it.But the gamble paid off well; I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. The stories range from touching to humorous. While I'm usually not a fan of 'country humor' (who can compare to Twain?). the humorous stories in this book weren't bad. The non-humorous ones were pretty good.Even though I wasn't raised in the South. all of my extended family was and many of these stories reminded me of my childhood when I used to spend time there."
7,"Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006. after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them. there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon. but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away."
7,"The Good:  These skewers are perfect. much better than traditional round ones and infinitely better than wooden ones.  For everyone who has ever had the frustration of trying to turn your food on the grill only to have the skewer turn inside the food and the food stay stuck to the grill. these wide rectangular skewers are perfect.  They are very long and very durable as well.  I have cooked numerous meals with them to include beef. vegetables and chicken.  Every one came out perfect and I never had a problem with the skewer sliding around inside the food itself.The Bad:  Even though these are stainless steel. after cooking with them and washing them off they rusted.  I quickly solved this problem with a Brillo pad and before I put the skewers away in the drawer. I coated them with a very light coat of olive oil.  Problem solved."
11,"Party Gras is fun from the start. It doesn't take more than a minute to get going. Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads. Because you play one category per card. then discard. the options are open. Everyone in our family enjoyed the game. which can go as long or short as you like.It's more fun to play in the background while you're doing something else. because some of the prompts fit into life on the go. Otherwise. some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal. It plays well during a party going on. dinner.  or video watching. You don't necessarily learn about other players. except how you enjoy the interaction."
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
7,"While not as strong as a trowel made of metal. Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks.  Made out of a composite plastic called `FiberComp'. the tool is very lightweight.  The blade is oversized. quite wide. and appears to be quite sturdy.  The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool. and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if not abused. it should last for a long while.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
12,"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable). but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics. then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit. but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money."
10,"Being a construction worker and a tool fanatic I must say this is the best saw on the market. At least 80 percent of constuction sites are occupied by the HD77 or it's brother the MAG77. I like the HD77 alittle better due to it's weight. I have yet to experience any heavy kickback and have yet to find any piece of lumber this won't rip through. This is a easy tool to use if you can handle a little weight (it doesn't take that long to get used to if you use lighter saws). This saw can handle being dropped several times and will last forever with an occasional oil. I don't have enough good things to say about this great saw."
11,"I have three kids. and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house.  Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first. but many kids move on quickly.  However; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy.  My 12 year old nephew. in particular. couldn't get enough of this.  He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog. to bring a drink to his dad. and the pacifier to his brother.  He plays with it every time he comes over.  I love that we have a toy he is interested in that isn't a video game.  I definitely caution you to heed the age warning. it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire. but for the right kid.  it is perfect!"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
12,"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that. this is a very solid effort."
7,"I've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost. I didn't think they could grow anymore because of the cold. This thing makes them grow! I was surprised. The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches. I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day. and if it's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better. other than that it's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter. It's good even if you want to start plants."
2,"After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up. we were looking for an appropriate replacement.  Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors. there were a few critical criteria.  It had to be strong. yet compact in size.  It should not be too loud. and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items.  Finally. we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers.  The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts.  It produces a powerful vacuum. easily maneuverable. convenient for storing. the noise is not too bad. and a good price.  This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value. and. certainly. gets the job done that we bought it for."
11,"You really don't need to know anything about D&D to play this game. As with all good games. there's a lot of variety in play decisions and lots of strategies to go for depending on the cards you get. With each person having a hidden 'role' to give them a potential bonus at the end. it's hard to tell who is winning. I think the builder role card is a bit too rewarding. but it is what it is. I just hate being the only one going after 'the builder' to keep them from getting points. because i tend to not be able to adapt a winning strategy for myself. The play is pretty straight-forward and limiting the number of rounds makes you consolidate your moves. though it does tend to lend to over analyzation. so if you have &#34;those&#34; kind of players in your gaming group. you may need to prod them every now and then. Fun to play with variety."
7,"I've used the 'vaporizer' twice and love it!  I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring; it doesn't take much to fry them plus. on a cold day. the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty.  I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all. the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered.  Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames.  Otherwise. a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt."
1,"Wish I'd known about this product in my 20s. Now that I'm in my 40s. I find that the hormonal changes are making UTIs something I need to be vigilant about again. after many years without them. I alternate between taking one of these at bedtime. & a daily tsp of D-mannose as a preventive measure. The mannose absorbs & carries away bacteria & the Cystex has a disinfecting action. so a multi-pronged approach. However. for travel these are a good deal less trouble than mannose which is a white powder. I have not had a single UTI in the 6 months I have been using this. I also give one to my elderly collie twice a week as she has developed the same issue. =o)  At least we're in this menopausal adventure together."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
1,"shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.atra was a great blade my worst experience the schick intuition plus.any of the mens mach3 blades a mug. brush and shaving soap is all you will needfor what may be one of life's finest pleasures...Closest shave on this planet. like silk baby!excellent blades. cost and experience for precision quick shavers..no man could ever beat our timing and terrain girlsmake sure you only buy your blades from amazon. don't get ripped upwith bootleg blades around here.blow dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean/dry)for blade life.no goosebumps or forget about it. turn up the heat please.as for fusion and proglide i love them/but they are costly and mach3 willgive you the fine bare shave you desire for less."
5,"I bought these primarily because they are so cheap. The quality is good I would say - not great. but not terrible either. They sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull. They don't last nearly as long as Elixirs. but then again. they are a lot cheaper than Elixirs. I would recommend these for practice - no gigging with these as the sound isn't quite as crisp as I would think a performer would want. For the price though. it's hard to knock on them too much."
11,"This is a great strategy and action game that is highly thematic. Essentially this is a cooperative game where the players are supposed to be working together. except that at least one player will end up being a traitor and nobody knows if it will be when the game starts or if it will come halfway through the game. The traitor tries not to be detected while subtly sabotaging the efforts of the human players to win the game. If the Cylon gets discovered then they can be even more deadly be directly throwing obstacles into the path of the human players who are trying to survive. There is a lot of tension as accusations fly and bids for power are made between the Admiral. President. and other characters in the game. What happens if the President or Admiral are secretly Cylons? What if they are both Cylons? Run through this game to find out for yourself. Every play feels like an episode of this great sci-fi adventure."
3,"I do not write reviews as often as I should. however. after attempting to read this bundle. I had to review.  I have never read anything that contained more adjectives than these books.  It was absolutely unbearable. I could tell that this author had writing talent.  The story flowed well and made sense.  I found myself scanning more than reading because I couldn't deal with the overly flowery writing style.  If that type of writing is not your style. you will want to skip these books.  Following is a small example of the nonstop adjective use in these books...A bitter mountain breeze wrapped around his long frame. whipping his shaggy hair against the furrowed ridges of his brow as Jeremy Burns hiked through the Maryland forest. Like a wrathful banshee. the relentless autumn winds howled with fury. while his fellow Bloodrunner. Cian Hennessey. quietly kept pace at his side.arrrggghhhAfter reading authors like JR Ward. this type of stuff made my eyeballs roll to the back of my head."
12,"This was the first 'Kart' game quite like this.. there isn't any 'Kart' game like this either outside of the Mario franchise. If you think you can find a better Karting game out there. I'd like to see you find it and show me. because from my finds and plays. this is the only game that is worth playing. From DK to Bowser. Peach to Toad. this game has most of the characters that have been involved with Mario in some way. The graphics are great for its time. the sound is fun. the worlds are colorful. the idea is great. Who wouldn't like this game- at ANY age? I'm not sure. but if you don't. you amy need to see a doctor. This is the best Kart game ever. and the best Mario Kart game ever."
11,"I hadn't played Boggle in decades and then my dear friend brought out her original boggle set and we started playing all the time.  I was so excited to get my own and therefore bought this one.  I really enjoy it and how it stimulates my brain.  What I also love about it is that my 7 yr old loves it!!  The first time he played he only saw one word. but he didn't give up and now he can find up to ten.  He's even finding words I didn't!  This game is fun and educational.  My family plays it at least weekly."
8,"Got this along with a few other toys a few weeks ago. This was clearly my dog's last choice. In fact. I didn't think he'd play with it at all. Eventually he started messing with it. so I was pretty thrilled. Of course. after a few days. he'd ripped some of the limbs open and stuffing was coming out. Overall. not one of his favorite toys. and doesn't seem very durable. The only squeaker in this thing is right in his stomach and it's hard to get to. I'm not even sure my dog even figured out it was in there. heck. I had trouble getting it. Get something else. Nothing special about sock monkey."
11,"I purchased this for my four year old (2 1/2 years ago) and when I was pregnant. we decided to write a book for the baby.  The first misstep was that Grandma let the 4 year old open this up on his own and scribble all over the two 'cover's.  So. our cover is a total scribble fest.  When I tried to order a new cover sheet. the online cost was $.20  totally reasonable.  But. they would not give you a PDF file so you could print it. you are required to have it shipped to you for $5.  Then. there are quite a few rules/guides/limits about how many words and drawing with only the provided markers within the box.Why not have your child draw pictures. photograph them and make a photo book at shutterfly or other photo site?  That would be much more flexible and easier. if you ask me..."
8,"This has 6 applications. where you use this on your dog once every month for 6 months during the summer months.  It helps to kills fleas and ticks that might get on your dog.  No dog should be left outside all day in the summer. because there is a bigger chance of your dog to get fleas and ticks.  Take them for walks. and let them out with you. but don't keep them out in the yard all day.  They need water. and air conditioning is nice!!!!"
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
10,"I had a Porter Cable 19.2 volt drill with a light but evetually my batteries went bad so I bought a Milwaukee 18 volt hammer drill/saw combo. I missed having the flashlight so I bought the Milwaukee light to go with my batteries. I like this light even better than the Porter Cable becuse the on/off switch is so much easier to use especially with gloves on. I highly recommend the light to anyone who had Milwaukee cordless tools because it is well built and very bright. The battery provides a stable base for it to sit on and the pivoting head makes it easy to shine the light where you need it. It is another great tool from Milwaukee."
8,"My cats love this and even my older 17 yr old cat which passed in 2012 was spunkier after eating this for a few weeks.  When I could see the difference. I knew there was something to this.  They eat the tuna and salmon flavor.  One bowl of this along with one of the flat cans of moist Friskies food split between each cat is what was the guaged right amount for my two cats per day.  They nibble on the dry cat food throughout the day. and look forward to the fresh moist food each morning and by the evening. it's gone.  Any more is too much; less will render lots of complaints with loud meows before the evening's done."
6,"I find the Avery labels the easiest to use.  Every software package I've ever attempted has the Avery Label templates already built in. and the labels peel off easily. and stay stuck to the envelope during mailing.I like to use the Return Address size labels for many different uses: pricing items for a garage sale. file folders (yes. they make file folder labels. but I'm frugal). labeling books and DVDs. and I also would use them if sending bottles/baby items to a daycare facility.I am a very frugal shopper. but when it comes to labels I feel Avery's quality justifies the price.  I would recommend Avery brand labels to anyone!"
8,"When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick.  Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great. our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that's about all.  We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it.  I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this.  Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves."
3,"Girl meets boy and they get married. Nevertheless. the author writes quite well which made it more interesting to me; however. the constant interruptions that she included to keep the main couple apart got irritating! Also.if I had realized that she would include explicit gross sex scenes. I probably never would have chosen this book as I don't think her first book was so overly sexual. I prefer Anne Perry.s type of writing about both love and the customs of 18th century England. Or more like Jane Austin."
5,"I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked. but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them. between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut. works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly. the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). But otherwise. worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!)."
6,"I had gotten my first TI calculator in 6th or 7th grade. My TI-83+ has survived about 10 years of being dropped. thrown in frustration. left in hot/cold cars. etc. I bought this calculator for a finance class so that I could enter the calculations I need as they are taught in class rather than figuring it out on my graphing calculator. The first thing I noticed are the keys aren't nearly as good and are kind of annoying to press.  The case isn't very solid at all. I get the feeling if I were to drop it that would be the end of this calculator. As for actual calculation it has been fine so far. but you need to change decimal settings. Out of box it rounds to 2 places. which is inadequate. I recommend setting it to 5."
7,"You won't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker.  Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes.  It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places.  There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started.  You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker!"
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
7,"We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it. because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is. the two hand-grips are each curved to the side. giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to 'steer' the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands. it was very awkward to 'steer' the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
11,"Players start the game by drawing cards which give them train routes across the US they should aim to create.  During the game. they create train routes. earning points for each segment created. plus bonus points for completing a designated route.  It's a strategy game with a dose of luck.  But compared to Ticket to Ride Europe. it is less cutthroat. and harder to thwart other players.  The game is fairly predictable. but fun and appropriate for both adults and children. groups of up to five as well as two players.  It's also good for those who want exposure to U.S. geography.  A fun. well-made game.  Recommended."
1,"This big pack was a huge problem solver for us.  We don't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully.  We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills.  Buying these has been a big relief for me. since I do most of the walking.  I am still using these and it has been MONTHS.  I will do this every time. The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal."
3,"This is Maris Mackenzie's story. She is working as a horse trainer for a prestigious owner in Kentucky and wakes up one morning to find herself in bed with a man she doesn't know. Maris finds herself in the middle of an investigation involving insurance fraud but realizes she's met the man she's going to marry.While Maris' journey to the altar is a short one. what's engaging about the story is when she and Alex MacNeil return to Ruth. Wyoming to meet the MacKenzie clan. It's an opportunity to check in on the other members of the family and watch Alex face the wrath of five brothers who question his motives.It is an entertaining story and any excuse to revisit MacKenzie Mountain makes it worthwhile."
11,"Love the idea of these bookmarks (we have two) and they're pretty great. but not perfect.  I don't have the instructions (as I recall. they arrived. we tore into the packaging-- don't think we saved the paperwork). so it could be there's a solution to this that I don't know of.  But the issue I have is that you can't tell that they're on unless you stare long enough to see the minute click over.  It shows seconds for a while. but once you've read a certain amount. they're no longer there.  Just a little indicator that showed it was counting would make a big difference.  On such a simple concept. that makes the difference between 4 and 5 stars for me.Otherwise. we've used them for a couple of weeks now and so far. so good."
1,"I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new. I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush. it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!"
12,"This game is pretty entertaining for the first couple weeks that you have it.  After that is doesn't really have much to offer.  The game just gets really easy to beat and extremely repetitive with all the says of the various characters.  Although the characters. with names like Slippy and Peppy. give some extra flavor to this boring game.  Multiplayer mode is just plain bad.  All of the escape moves make it too easy to dodge your opponents fire. so the game takes forever. and the multiplayer levels themselves offer you nothing interesting.  This game does have it's value for a little while so if you want to try it then rent it. don't waste your money buying it."
10,"I'm dumbfounded that after all of these years. DeWalt still hasn't corrected the ongoing problem with the flexible neck being too wimpy to hold up the light for very long. I thought. jeez the most recent review looks to be 2011. there should be an improvement by now... lol. nope. I finally removed the thing. got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck. stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand. problem solved for now. I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes. bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag."
2,"My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan. so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog. A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time. so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe. because it can be a pain to clean. especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still. it's not too difficult. and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it."
1,"I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1.5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use."
2,"I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product. but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit. finish. and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating."
5,"I ordered this product to use for personal recording. and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it 'New.' and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First. the package was stapled. that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then. to make matters worse. there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new. I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
6,"This simple calculator seems to work fine. as advertized.  I docked it a star because I wasn't able to find a function for integrations or higher order functional analysis. but I suppose you can't have everything in a five dollar calculator.It also lacks voice control. has little or no artificial intelligence. and in general makes a very poor companion if you're stuck alone with it on a desert island.  It does break the ice at parties with the classic 58008 joke. but only the most sophisticated of users are able to appreciate the humor."
10,"first i must say this is the only mortiser i have used.the machine was easy to set up 10 minutes from box to running. i got a free jet chiesel set with purchase.the first thing i played with was popular cut sweet. next scrap cherry a cake walk(1/4 mortise made) .the only thing i see is seal the base(which is mdf) . i ordered chiesels from lee valley for the dresses project i got this for.saw final word for the average woodworker/weekend warrior a+ machineoh yes as stated before i got free chiesels. free prime delivery fast and well packaged. good price and a stellar toy.if you dont have one put on your bucket list ."
8,"I found this to be the best bargain for a higher quality dog food. comparable to Wellness and Blue Buffalo. My dogs both love it and one of my dogs that often gets topical yeast infections does not have problems on this food so its not full of bread filler. The only other food comparable for my dog's yeast problem is Wellness and it got too pricy for me.  I did notice a salmonella recall on the Diamond lamb flavor. spring of 2012. so I keep an alert on my google news.  but its the only recall I've seen and it went public fast. right on the Diamond site and there were no fatalities because it was dealt with well.  Still. good to know."
7,"I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy. but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose. the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup. it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope. or pumping benzene through it.I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years. but never snap in half like that.Next time I'll listen to that little voice."
5,"As stated. I use the D'Addario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for theGibson LP's and I use Brite wires on those.I like the D'Addario's over the Brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier.I do not produce a lot of body acid. so strings last a very long time with me. no matterwho the manufacturer is. and I play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuse.The EXL strings produce great tone. and are great for bending."
11,"This is a fun brain burner - on the lite side.  We love the way the game plays (120 equally sized pieces. each consisting of two joined hexes. come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that make up the piece - some pieces have two identical symbols. some have two different symbols (not unlike dominoes). The goal of the game is. through clever placement. to obtain points in the different symbol colors. Points are claimed by placing a piece such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol.)  This is a game that all the kids can play. though with adults. the strategies can become subtle and challenging.  Loads of fun!!"
8,"My male cat has a lot of allergies.  I've tried using many products to boost his immune system and add luster to his coat.  I also happen to show dogs and use the Nupro Gold on my show line of animals with great results so I decided to try cat nuggets.  WONDERFUL.  At first my male cat wasn't to keen on eating it. the female gobbled it down.  After a few days he ate it fine.  I just sprinkle a 1/2 teaspoon on their individual breakfast.  You can also mash it up into can food.  Male cat no longer has the runs. coat looks amazing. and no allergy issues taking this supplement.  (He's allergic to grain and certain cat litters).  Female cat also looks amazing but she never had much of an issue looking fab!"
6,"I've been using Mead notebook paper since I was a kid in school. It's a really good standby.Nowadays I really like to use it as stationery. I cut off the red lines. and then cut down by about five lines from the top to get a good-sized lined piece of paper that can be jazzed up with rubber stamps. Additionally. I also use it a backing paper with nice stationery. so that I don't use more than one sheet of nice stationery for a letter--I use the nice piece as the first page. and these cut to size for other sheets. Either way. it helps save money while creating lined stationery. (Yes. I'm someone who still writes letters!)Whichever use you're getting it for--stationery or school--this basic pack is a generous size with 200 sheets."
3,"I was going to give four stars. but this newspaper and the subscription experience really couldn't be any better.  My expectations were low based on old reviews. but it looks like everything is worked out now.  There are sufficient graphics. plenty of good content. with the bylines you'd expect.  Okay. cartoons. comics. and crosswords would be nice. but I can forgive the omission.  In fairness. I've only been reading the paper for a few days. so maybe there will be delivery problems in my future.  If so. I'll update this review.  But so far so good.  I'm considering a move to Austin. and I expect to learn a lot about the area by reading the local paper.  This is a really good small newspaper."
8,"I rated this product as I did because it may have a little dust but not near as much as others I have used... The price is right on this product being it is delivered in 2 days to my door... I choose the 14 lb box as my litter box is upstairs and it's a pain to haul the bigger boxes up the steps... One other thing I find the smaller box good for is storing the used litter until I fill the box.... I can then carry the used litter downstairs to dispose.... I wash the litter box a couple times a month and 14 lbs fill it nicely... My cats are not picky about scented or unscented and I have used both with good results..."
11,"We had a big family game night last week and I broke out the new Scene It Comedy edition.  It featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the DVD which was included.  The game board can also be expanded for longer games.  About 10 of us played the game and most of us were confused by the questions.  I have never heard of a lot of the movies that were included.  All in all. unless you are a complete comedy movie buff. I do not recommend.  I have played other Scene It Games in the past and enjoyed them - I think I just wasn't into the Comedy Movies that were included."
3,"This book was below average. There was no build up to Angie and Ryan. He says 'come home with me' and she agrees. When Wade was added it seemed too easy. Angie didn't question him or ask about him just jumped right in. I disliked Wade because if he got his heart broke why was he jumping into a threesome. Ryan couldn't voice his jealousy about Wade with Angie. Angie blindly went along with everything and didn't show a mind of her own. The sex scenes were good and the only reason I gave it three stars. The end felt like the author  gave up on her characters. It ended just as quick as it all began. There was no plot only sex which doesn't normally bother me but this was so unreal. It felt fake from beginning to end."
3,"H Beam Piper will stand as one of the greats of sci-fi/fantasy for as long as the printed word exists. whether you are a mystery/thriller. detective novel or space opera/alternative universe fan. Piper delivers. In H B's writing you will find the forerunner of many who followed in his ginormous footsteps. (federated terran space. space vikings. even his place names have been copied by later writers! Aldebaran sound familiar)? Great reading. great fun and a must for anyone who really wants to be lost in another space/time continuum!"
8,"We bought this to use in our backyard as it said it was a smaller version to throw the balls a shorter distance.  They weren't kidding.  We have a full-size chuckit and this junior version and this really doesn't throw nearly as far.  I'd say the average adult could throw just as far as this. so we've kind of rotated this out of usage and just use the full-size if going to a park and simply throw the ball by hand if we're in the backyard.  This was a waste of money as you can just use the full-size for shorter distances too and simply not throw the ball as far."
12,"Excellent game all around except one thing....The game CHEATS.You can be in first place and magically all the computer controlled racers somehow manage to catch up to you anyway.Now. if you're in last place you literally have no chance of catching up.Not fair.Not cool.That aside....if you develop your skills you'll still win.After much practice I still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheats.Great graphics.Every character you love from the Mario universe.I think Toad is my favorite. when he gets hit LOL. The noise he (it?) makes is hilarious.The courses are inventive and enjoyable.The music fits in perfectly.Did I mention it cheats?That's my only complaint.Otherwise another five star winner from Nintendo.Highly recommended."
12,"This is one of the best and my personal favorites from the Zelda franchise! The story was fantastic. the gameplay was amazing for the time. even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitches.There was hardly any serious problems with this game. The playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do. Each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy. Some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating it?Puzzles in this game were I suppose challenging for  child but they were not impossible. This is a great game for all ages and a great buy as well."
5,"This is a great-sounding reverb pedal. Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep. rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). The design is very solid. and the controls are quite easy to use. Honestly. I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much. but there's no problem with them being there.I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon. U2. etc. Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones. this is it. This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals. but this one definitely suits all my needs."
12,"Greetings. I am Oklonia. My review of Super Mario 64 is right here.Super Mario 64 is a game that all master N64 gamers have to own!I don't even need to tell the story. What's happened? The same traditional story: Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool.Mario finds the princess. rescues her. and destroys Bowser.Capcise.The courses and star's names are quite creative. (e.g. Lil' Penguin Lost) They are more riddles though.The graphics are so sharp looking and realistic. that maybe just a few could go on GameCube. (GCN)Despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode. Super Mario 64 is really super!This has been Oklonia."
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
10,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish. can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance. but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said. I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
8,"My two mini-dachshunds love these treats. They're made of quality ingredients. with meat listed first. and are produced in the USA. I like that they contain supplements for joint health since dachshunds are prone to spine and joint problems. The pieces are too big for my little dogs. but they're soft and chewy so I can easily tear them apart. I've had the same bag for about a month now since my dogs don't get treats every day. and the treats are still nice and soft. not stale at all. These treats would probably be great for older dogs with dental problems. too. since they're so chewy."
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
11,"Let me give you a new family ritual before I even begin my review: Whenever someone in my family mentions Bananagrams. we all sing a little song to the tune of Menomena by the Muppets. It goes. 'Dut dada dat... Bananagrams! Dut dada dat.'Now for the review. The basic premise of Bananagrams is that lettered tiles are distributed among the players. and everyone competes to use all the letters in the bag to build real words that are connected to each other like a crossword. Whoever finishes first wins. I'm in my 30s. but when my siblings. parents. and I get together we play Bananagrams and have a blast. The game is simple but so much fun and fast paced. It's good for your brain. vocabulary. and concentration skills.If you like crossword puzzles or Scrabble. and if you have some friends or family who share your interests. you'll love Bananagrams."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
7,"Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least. Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada. at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not. then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective."
3,"I loved this title!  It's fun. sexy. very entertaining.The heroine is feisty. not falling all over the Hero. her own person.  She's not mooning over oh lover where art thou?  I like a no (or not too much) nonsense heroine that doesn't pout. cry over nothing. cringe. and otherwise wimp out.  She can give a punch and take a punch after all this is an adventure.  A tough cookie who doesn't mind enjoying one hot hunky guy without agonizing over it.The Hero is long suffering and on the heroine's side.  There are lots of bad guys and lots of double crossing.  It's just a good light read.  I did not think there was too much sex. it was appropriate to the story and relationship.  I happen to like space romances and this is a good one.I will read more of this writer."
3,"Father Mine is a short story that is a continuation of Zsadist and Bella's story. It picks up sometime after Lover Enshrined. but going on at the same time as well.This story starts after Nalla is born. about three months after. in fact. Zsadist is still having a hard time dealing with his past as a blood slave. and it's taking a toll on his mating. and with his relationship with his daughter.This is a sweet. romantic story that I was hoping for. having finished Lover Awakened and almost feeling cheated by the ending. This book gives Bella and Z their HEA. and it really makes me love Z more. Great short story. and a must-read for any BDB fans. :)"
2,"The idea of a machine that ground &amp; brewed coffee was too good to resist. and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog);  within the first year the heating element croaked.  Sent it back &amp; got a replacement unit. which incidentally only is warranteed for the balance of the first unit's warranty!  6 months later. today. with a full pot of coffee on board. it burst into flame!  Whoa! Fortunately my husband was in the kitchen and took care of it before the house went up. I'm going back to Braun. no question!!"
2,"I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.  She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition. but does well with her customary food.  I tried using a blender. but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.  We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA. which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.  I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the 'cheaper' one.  I am impressed with its performance. ease of use and compact size.  It is clearly worth the small price I paid.  I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.  It is perfect for my intended use. and I can envision how to use it in cooking. I highly recommend it."
1,"My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B. which he said was the best of its kind. I'm glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque. far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I'm confident I'll use it consistently. Finally. I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work."
8,"There are three main problems with this product. The first is that it does not fit the littermaid box well at the base (where the box fits into the botoom). As a result you end up with some cat litter on the floor as a result. instead of all of it in this product. Secondly. the top part does not fit into the top well. Some effort required to get it in properly. Thirdly. the product is made of very weak plastic. As a result. if it is filled up. it bends quite a bit (to the point where it makes handling a chore). Higher quality/harder plastic should have been used to avoid this problem."
10,"I work construction and do plenty of research on tools. Skil currently makes less then par products. but with this exception. This saw is the industry standard. I see the MAG77 and the regular HD77 on every construction site. I like the HD77 because it is a little smoother then the MAG77 due to the heavier steel casing. which means no kickback and a stonger. more solid feel. Both saws are incredible and either purchase is an investment. Buy this saw if you plan on cutting a lot of lumber."
3,"These are very nicely written with lots of great vocabulary which I love especially since I have the click link for full definition!  The mysteries are not written from the point of view of the doctor. so you get to wait until the testimony to see if your accused will be found guilty! Some follow the &#34;Watson&#34; style character. some follow the innocent person caught in a horrible web of guilt. and some even follow the perpetrator! They are quite wonderful. Slight warning for you to be aware that in those times often the 'gentlemen' and 'ladies' (whites) are considered less &#34;suspicious&#34; than the &#34;foreign&#34; characters. But if you only read books with modern mores you will miss much."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
1,"You want a battery that is going to last. then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used. going on 7 months now. I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes. a good purchase price for this 8 pack."
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
3,"Very. very funny. with the clever twist of having intelligent trolls that are a part of a functioning society.  My wife (whose Amazon account I am hacking since I do not have one of my own) starting downloading Tuttle's books on the Kindle and we are both in the process of flying through the entire catalogue.  This is one of the funnier books that I have read in a long time. set in a fantasy world that does not conform to the normal archetypes of the various creatures normally found in such worlds.  Get this story and enjoy it."
5,"I take workshop style guitar courses at a local Vo-Tech in a room that could not be any less suited to the purpose. People set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall. Bad scene (sounds like an old 'El Kabong' cartoon). and not what I want to have happen to my new Seagull Artist series guitar. This little Fender stand easily folds up into a package small enough to fit in the storage pocket of my deluxe TRIC case so I can take it with me to class.It's not the sturdiest. most secure or most stable design out there. but given it's extreme portability and the use I'll put it to. it's going to work great."
5,"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived. so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus. one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy. so for reminiscent's sake. I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter. this will work just as well as the expensive ones. and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]"
6,"I feel this is below average notebook paper here.  The holes were well punched in the paper I received and the lines were correctly printed on the pages with no missing lines. but the lines are light and the paper is thin.  It will work. but you could do better on price and quality at Wal-Mart.  If you can't make it so a store. this isn't a bad option. albeit not excellent.As a side note. I don't think it's too uncommon to buy notebook paper with lines missing on a few pages in a pack.  I've had this happen to me in the past."
11,"OK so I'm not into strategy games ( because I am horrible at those games) and I think their really boring.  And I was on the fence about this game but I was at a meet up and a group was playing it and their bragging how it's the best game....So I came home and researched it and had tons of great reviews.  So I decided to but it without ever playing it. Although I can't say it's the best game ever only because I am a into party games. but this is by far the best strategy game I have ever played. I am trying to get my fiance to play games ( not a gamer) and he loves it too. It is so easy to learn!!! The instructions are so overwhelming.  so what I do is go online and watch other people explain the rules and play.  because seriously instructions are hard to understand.  Definitely worth it and would absolutely recommend Ticket to Ride"
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
7,"This is a nicely made feeder. easy to assemble. fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made. easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it."
7,"I got this to go with my Craftsman air compressor that I recently got as the compressor only came with a basic inflator for the tires.  I wanted one that had a gauge on it so you could read the tire pressure when you are inflating the tires.  My compressor uses the &#34;M&#34; fittings. so I  bought the Campbell Hausfield kit to go with it to be able to get it to connect to my compressor quick connects.The inflator is fairly simple to use. just put the chuck on the tire stem and pull the lever on the chuck and inflate.  The gauge seems to be fairly accurate as I compared it to a regular tire gauge and the readings were the same.This inflator seems to be good quality and will work for what I need which is occasional use around the house.  It is a decent price at around 14 bucks."
7,"This is a good. standard pot holder.  The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing (a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and don't work for my situation).  So functionality wise. these have been perfect.  But aesthetically. it still pretty utilitarian looking.  There's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  Because of that. I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it's own.Aesthetics aside. it functions as expected and is perfect for people (like me) whose railings are not a uniform size."
7,"The Havahart Deer Off Ready-To-Use Repellant applied a lot of repellent quickly. It was easy to set the direction of the spray. The battery option was a great addition to spraying to keep the deer from eating and/or trampling our plants and it made the application process a lot easier. It appears to work well as there has been no damage of plants after the first application.On the other hand. there was no wand with our bottle of repellant which made it impossible to apply a fine mist/spray (packaging implied it should have been part of what we received). The bottom compartment was hard to open and the nozzle we had to use because of having no wand dripped while applying.Update: This spray is doing a fantastic job of keeping the squirrels out of the birdfeeders."
3,"I got this book for my Kindle free; after reading I'm really glad I didn't pay anything for it. The storyline had the potential for a good 'Twilight Zone' kind of story. but was just too lightweight to make it. The author seems to feel the need to put in really XX rated sex scenes - she seemed to love to be able to use the word c**k. I didn't find this adding anything to the story. and only finished it because it's a fairly short book."
6,"This mounting tape has worked out well on many different surfaces. It is pretty strong too. I have actually used it to hang smaller/lighter pictures in frames and none have come falling down..yet. There is a good amount of tape in the roll. so you can get a good number of things hung with it. I also used it to hang one of the full length door mirrors on my daughter's bedroom door. It has held so far so good..and that is even with her slamming the door at times. I am getting pretty brave at using it for larger. heavier items - I just make sure to use a good bit of the tape around all edges. so that it is secure."
3,"This story was not like the other books I've read from Kallysten in the past. I found it difficult to engage in the story at the beginning. However. once I stuck it out past the first 5 or 6 chapters. I was pleasantly surprised. I found that instead of the instant sex appeal and gripping tensions with characters that immediately immersed me in the past. it was a story that read like a slow burn. gradually building up layers of complexity. and personality in all the players involved. By the time I was half way through the book. Kate's issues were personal to me. and I was rooting for them to find a way to make it work. I actually cried towards the end of this book. and that's an incredibly rare thing for me as a reader. So although it took me longer to get into the characters and their story. it was well worth it to keep it up. and see it through to the end."
3,"I've had this book since October 2011. It's now mid-March 2012. and I've only just read it today.I have to say. for the first page and a half. I really did wonder what I was reading. but very quickly the quirky writing and the tongue-in-cheek hunour took over. and I was caught!Trolls. Vampires. a man who finds things and a neighbour who is some sort of voodoo witch crossed with a look-out... This was great fun. Delighted to give this five stars. and hope that if you ever have a few hours and need a good short with no pretence of the irony and curious humour that fantasy can sometimes throw at you. this is a great place to start!"
7,"This is a great hatchet that Paul would have liked to have had in his wood choppers tool box. There was a heavy storm in these parts fairly recently with very strong winds that knocked down many trees. Two of my neighbors trees fell into my yard and tore up my cedar fence. I also had my largest hardwood tree get blown over in my backyard where it fell without causing any damage. I sure wish Paul was available to help me out. Instead of Paul. this Fiskars hatchet came to the rescue in helping to clear up this big mess. Yes. I had to use a chainsaw as well when it came to cutting up the tree trunks. But the hatchet made short work of chopping up a lot of the branches. The hatchet has a nice heft and a comfortable grip. The blade stayed sharp far longer than I had anticipated. This is a must have tool to keep at hand. A great tool and a great price..."
2,"I have several OXO Good Grips gadgets in my kitchen and I find they are consistently well designed and do the job they are meant to do and do it well. This corer is right up there with the best of the OXO tools. The handle is large and sturdy and helps me get a good grip so I can get the core out with one motion. I have really bad arthritis in my hands so if this tool did not perform well. I'd be looking for a replacement.I find this size takes out just the right amount of core. I tend to buy organic when possible and those apples are generally a little smaller than conventionally grown ones. This corer takes out just enough so the seeds and little tough seed casing is removed without taking too much of the apple flesh.Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend."
12,"I usually turned off all lights and played game in deep night after a whole-day work. even on bloody Quake I or Doom II. it is ok. And I was for a long time a Quake II fan. esp. in single player mode. With numerous add-on levels distributed on the web. I thought the 3D-shooter game has  reached the limit in Quake II. But alas. what a game the Half-Life is!  I  DARE NOT played it in the deep night alone with all lights off. With a very  good storyline and excellent atmosphere. the game is horrible!  You never  know what the next step will be. The monsters are not stupidly standing  there waiting for your bullets. instead they are chasing and hunting you.  It is simply the best single player 3d shoot game so far."
3,"This story was more a rough draft than anything that should have been published. First thing. the two men. we know they're ex-Seals. but we have no idea what they REALLY do for a job in this book (security?). how they came there. and what POSSIBLE interest they have in Christina since she is skittish and phobic. Off the bat. theyre trying to get in Christina's pants for a life time relationship... are you kidding me? Serious? All of a sudden they're flying from an unknown location to Chicago in their personal jet with a king size bed? Kidnap her dog? Its frustrating... this book was scattered in thought. execution and information."
12,"For years.DOOM has been labeled as an evil video game.with extreme violence and satanic imagery.But I say hold on a sec here.I am a Christian myself.and I absolutley love this game.Why you may ask? ...because you get to destroy demons that are straight from Hell!!! I mean come on! What Christian wouldnt wanna love doing that in a video game??? Its not like you shoot people.like in the Grand Theft Auto games.Only people you shoot are fellow marines who are evil and sold out to Satan. So Christians....play with an open mind and understand the TRUE meaning of this game. It is good vs evil!!"
1,"Review for: Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush.  I'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets.  I'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road. the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots.  Flip it around and you get nice scraping action.  Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles. however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.  So hats off to this simple. classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time."
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit.

3,"A town that does not appear in the maps. a missing totem that is needed to save it from outsiders and a love story between a sexy shapeshifter and a woman with special skills make it an entertaining read despite the characters being a bit flat for my taste.There are a couple of very sexy scenes including a hot threesome; I just wish the author  developed the relationship with Burke's brothers a bit more. because it ended when it was getting really good. but overall I think there is potential for the next books in this series."
3,"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4. unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!"
2,"I've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice. Both times were a total sucess!  The ice cream is delicious!  No more ice and salt mess! Preparation time is quick and easy! The machine is a little noisy. however. no big deal. It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result. Time in the freezer is usually needed after it's done.  That's the hardest part....the waiting!  Clean up time is quick as well! Looking forward to trying the other recipes in the booklet. I'm sure they'll be just as tasty.  I highly recommend this machine!!  I know that we'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now!"
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
5,"This is the answer to your all your power supply needs. If you own more than 1 pedal (and we all do) You need this. It powers my Wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug. It comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for 5 pedals. It has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain. It also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in. and it has a 10 foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing. you'll save enough money to pay for it in no time. not having to buy batteries. Get it. you'll love it! I"
3,"This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up."
10,"This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem. but not its other fault. difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place."
12,"This is the one that started it all folks! this is about mysterious murders in Raccoon city involving cannibalism. a group of special police officers called 'S.T.A.R.S.' go outside the city to find the murderers but when their Helicopter with pilot leaves them behind. they seek shelter in a large mansion but unknown to them that the mansion is also a death trap with hordes of Zombies. giant tarantulas. monster dogs and mutant creatures waiting for them. will they make it out alive?A brilliant and highly original game using elements of Lucio Fulci. George Romero. Dario Argento. horror and science ficiton with clues. gore. cool monsters. puzzles and knowing how to survive which makes this a one-of-a-kind game for every game player. I've became a fan of this since 1996. it's the best game i've ever played with the entire series too."
10,"This outfeed table is well worth the price paid. Assembly took me about half a day. but I wasn't in any rush. It color-matches the light grey of the Unisaw nicely. I really like the 12' fixed portion of the table- it helps on follow-through for smaller work pieces which don't necessarily require use of the full outfeed table. I'd like to reiterate what one of the reviewers said earlier that. unfortunately. when the table is not in use and hanging down adjacent to the saw. the single support leg of the table completely blocks the saw's exhaust port. I would rather see a support leg on each corner of the table. which would allow access for a 4' hose to attach to the exhaust port AND would provide a bit more stability for the extended outfeed table. A hose can still be attached. but the lowered table will not be able to drop to a completely vertical position. I would still recommend this table."
6,"This mouse pad works great with my optical mouse. It isn't thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad. It's the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead-filled wrist cushion. It is a COMFORTABLE mouse pad covered with a soft  polyester fabric attached to a non-skid sponge rubber base. The texture provides good control for my mouse. For me. it's the perfect mouse pad. it's a nice color. and the price is right. too!"
10,"I have used these for a few years. They are sturdy and do not deflect all that much even with abusive projects like fencing.The big negatives are:1. Hard to adjust due to choice of screws on the base that hold them in place. For some reason. these screws are not knobs or thumb screws. Instead. they are big screws that require a tool  to turn. Why? This is the sort of thing that begs for a knob or at least a thumbscrew.2. This works in conjunction with a length stop attachment. Because thee is clumsiness in setting up this units' support extension. there are issues that are caused on the length stop. too. It all works OK. but it is slower. stickier and more frustrating than it could have been.In any case. if you need/want something like this for the DW. this is your choice and at least it won't break."
12,"This is one of my favorite games of all time.  In this game. there are 30 different levels that are mostly composed of the same 3D Crash levels that we're used to. Some levels. however. you get to use a biplane. motorcycle. or Jet Ski. Like the previous versions of Crash. you have to collect crystals and gems.  Now. you can also collect a relic for having the best time.  The music is fun. the controls are easy and it's just an overall great game for any age."
11,"Twilight has a lot going for it. but I personally think it is just too top heavy for play.  You have to be a true fan and dedicate an entire day to play this game.  The box states a few hours but it takes an entire hour to set up the game alone.  And the concept is flawed as well. though it has a very nice idea behind it.  My personal bone to pick would be the artwork.  I happen to think it is silly.  But that is me and not a fair thing to say. other than I am the customer."
10,"I hate it when my shirt collars. not otherwise secured in place by buttons. end up in weird places throughout the day. I purchased some steel collar stays to use with these magnets but they were only vaguely magnetic. I ended up using 2 of these magnets - one in the collar with the stay and the other inside my shirt. to lock my collar in place. They work flawlessly. They are the perfect size. and there are plenty of magnets in case you forget to remove them at the end of the day."
3,"I thought that the hero was very annoying at first. He wanted the heroine and then went back to give his ex another try because he felt he owed it to her. The heroine then met his controlling. jack butt of a cousin when she was vulnerable from the hero and married him. A year later. her husband left with the heroine's money and best friend and the hero was no longer engaged to his ex. The hero could have saved them both a year of heart ache if he would have just stayed with the one who gave him the 'spark' he kept mentioning. but nope. he had to go back to the woman who was good for him in a robotic way. It was his fault entirely that she lost her 'fire' because his cousin drowned it out and she would never had went to the cousin if the hero did not reject her the next morning!!!"
1,"A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two.  This went on for several months.  After reading about this product. I purchased a tube:  within 24 hours. the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over.  Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  To say that we are shocked is an understatement. particularly when we read the ingredients. which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  This is a miracle in a tube. and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  Highly recommend this."
5,"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end. my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock. blues. metal. country. or punk guitar player."
5,"I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip. the right string resonance for strumming. and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely. strum more softly. and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal."
5,"I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars. banjos. and mandolins.They attach to the wall with 2 screws.  Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall.  It takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic.The piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument.  The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have.I have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again.Very sturdy. well made product."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
11,"We had tons of fun with this game! I'm excited it helps my 3-year-old learn letters. My 7-year-old loves it too. The box is quite big. make sure you have lots of room for storing it. Not a take along type of game. It's really a lot like Twister. with some added learning thrown in. Trying to touch your ears to the letters is fun. and hilarious. The only thing I don't like. is that if we get too many feet cards right away and not a lot of letters. the game is over too soon. and no one has the winning secret card yet. Just shuffle the cards well so you don't have too many feet card. The mat is very sturdy and colorful. and the cards and peices are well made too. We love Dr. Seuss and ordered this for his birthday celebration week. I would recommend this game."
2,"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower!  I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily. but also they didn't work very well.  So far. OXO's version has been a big improvement:  the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids. and with a simple twist. the lid is off cleanly and neatly.  I have found that the unit can sometimes slip. especially with a very small lid. but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface. you should have mostly success. as I have."
12,"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made. and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value. you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me. and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given. it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it. since it is one of those video games you have to beat."
2,"This is as described but for some reason. I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices. sandwiches. cucumbers. etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.  You could also use it as a form for making pancakes. etc but they would be very small!  I wouldn't use it as a cookie cutter but my family makes double the size of the average cookie.  Maybe for mini cookies this would work..."
2,"I followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated in buying this. The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up. Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use. The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple. Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples. A little of the core is left in the apple. but for normal store sized apples it works great. Highly recommended!"
2,"I used to own a Mighty Light. which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder.This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything(carpet. velvet drapes). Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface (unlike other small canisters). it's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it's in the close proximity."
6,"A long time user of Avery labels. I was especially drawn to these because of the promise of smudge-free labels with sheets that pass easily.  I have a finicky. but expensive. printer that on occasion wrinkles sheets that pass through the manual. non-drawer feeder.  This happens most frequently with labels.  So I was happy to see that after using more than 2 dozen of these sheets that they do indeed pass smoothly as described. furthermore no smudging!!!  This is vitally important as with these big labels pressing them onto envelopes sometimes requires quite a bit of handling.  I'm very happy with these labels and will definitely be switching from the regular 2X4 labels to these with TrueBlock that work seamlessly and smudge-free.Highly recommended!"
10,"This is simple and straight forward. The roller works very well...I will tell you not to let the glue dry on the roller. while it may not stick to the roller it is not easy to get off once it does dry. When you are done take a couple of minutes and rinse off the roller in the sink.The rest of the attachments are a cool idea but the hassle of changing them out makes them less friendly to use than the standard nozzle on a regular carpenter's glue bottle.  I love the roller and use it all the time and that makes this item worth having but I wouldn't get excited about the other attachments if I were you."
6,"This is a pack of standard. wide ruled writing paper that is 3 hole punched.  There are 200 pages per package.  We've had no problems writing on this paper and putting it into a 3 ring binder.The pages themselves are well made. but might be a bit thinner than other standard papers.  We have not experienced any problems with the paper yet. and we are a family of 2 adults. a 4 year old learning to draw and write basic letters. and a 7 year old doing basic sentences."
6,"This is yet another great label product by Avery.  Of course it works with Avery's DesignPro template software.  I used these in a HP LaserJet printer and had no issues with smudging--all the print was clear.  The only thing I did not like was the pop-up edge for fast peeling.  It works great if you print a full sheet of labels each time. but occasionally I only need to print a few labels and when the sheet goes through the printer a few times it can start to separate easily.  Not a big deal. just something to be aware of if you only print a few labels at a time.  I would recommend these labels and I would buy them again!"
5,"I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short. so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground. or horizontally placed. but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand."
1,"We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and. owing to the angle of the head. one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order. the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush. bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend."
3,"Simon he may be the beta of the Pride but that boy is fierce when it comes to his woman. 'if I find yout that you had a hand in helping Livia hurt my mate I will kick your a** so hard you'll s*** out of your mouth after I have you cast out of the Pride. You understand me?' He's just a big kitty where Becky is concerned. 'Simon was purring. She ran her hands soothingly up and down his back. making him purr even louder. She bit her lip to keep from giggling.' The man has no shame when it comes to sharing a bathroom. 'he looks at her. confused. He pointed with the toothbrush. 'Toilet's right there. baby.' I'm excited for Adrian's book."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."

2,"You most definitely get what you pay for. these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife. they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one."
10,"If you have some time and skill to fine tune this plane. it has the potential to be a useful tool.  I was initially taken aback by how much refining the plane needed.  I dont mean just honing. It comes with an edge that needs work before it can be honed to the point I would call it sharp.  The other parts fit tightly. causing you to fight them just to make an adjustment. I expected better fit and finish.  I like a plane. or any other tool to work smoothly. like it was  passed down to you from your grandfather.It isn't something that a little time and patience can't fix.  And I suppose that you could make the argument that this fine tuning will make you more familar and thus more confident with this tool.All in all. it's worth the price.  Just plan on breaking it in."
8,"I'm glad this toy has no stuffing in it. but for a few dollars more. the Kong Cozie is stuffed firmly and has a squeaker in the middle that lasts and lasts. My puppy has two varieties of the unstuffed Kong animals. one being this frog. They were correct to give you a free extra sqeaker. The toy. without stuffing. is very thin and flimsy. and the squeakers don't last. So far. the toy has not ripped. though. so I think the quality is decent for 5 bucks! But my 8 and 9 dollar Kong Cozies last as well and there is no need for extra squeakers."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
8,"i was having a lot of trouble with my hip this summer and my chiro suggested i try this in addition to taking it a little more easy in the gym.  i was happy to try it since i was popping ibuprofen like pez.  it wasn't immediate. but. the pain has pretty much subsided. i'm finally running again and the only pain i feel are in the muscles that are still tight around the side of my hip. i am making sure to gently stretch and foam roll to reduce tension and soreness."
8,"This year I decided to go cheap and purchase a less expensive brand of flea control... well I certainly paid for it with a nice infestation of fleas. even on my inside cat! I went back to this more expensive (but certainly more reliable) brand and the fleas have completely gone. I noticed with the cheaper brands they have a lot of liquid and it takes forever for the big greasy spot on the back of the cat's neck to try. How unsightly! But with this I couldn't even tell if I was putting any on them. it was so discreet. I will definitely be sticking with this from now on."
3,"The story is short and enjoyable. Because of the length. time moves quickly. a few days covered by a few sentances to briefly explain what happened. feelings. throughts. While short. the writer has done a wonderful job with emotions. with showing how the characters changed over the four years from first meeting to finding each other again. Touching concerns. fears. wants and hope. very nicely done.Think of it as a condensed story without a lot of the fluff that is put into stories to pad the pages. The good base is there. but alot little things that would add length are not. For me. this was great. really enjoyable. I can see where others might not like it though."
11,"Melissa & Doug know just how to make things special for kids and easy for parents. This version of Hangman is great in that there are no pieces to go missing and it's easy to pass back and forth between parent and child or child and child. All of the pieces are attached with a type of rubber band that allow you to flip the letter or body part over but they never come off. The erasable pen stays clipped to the side and has a built in eraser in the pen tip.You can do this with a beginning reader's sight words and spelling words. You can choose vocabulary words for test studying for an older student or just free play. And there is something pleasing about the sound the tiles make when they are flipped over and make their 'thwack' noise.Lot's of fun for a beginning reader to just about any elementary age child. Durable. fun to look at and versatile."
7,"I've used this for around a year now. absolutely love it.  I keep getting more gardening tools and haven't ran out of pockets yet.  The pockets are all different sizes. some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker. there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly.  I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves."
10,"This is a fine saw.  It has been an acurate work horse since i bought it six months ago.  The standard blade was ok but required upgrading for fine trim and furniture work.This this is BIG.  It's not especially heavy. just big. It takes up much more room that a standard miter saw. The sliding mechanism is the primary culprit. The old saw stand in my shop. is now a laundry cabinet in the basement.  I had to build an all new. BIGGER. cabinet.It takes up about as much space as a Radial Arm Saw.  It costs  more than than a RAS.I not unhappy with the performance at all.  It does require the new cabinet for cutting large stock.  The stability on heavy wide stock as demands the unit be anchored well too.Make sure you need a sliding miter.  You may be better off with a RAS and a standard miter saw."
5,"I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it. What I like about this one is how the release lever works. On the Cannon the lever was vertical. This made actuating it a less natural motion. With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases. That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use. An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with it.Aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well."
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
1,"This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash. 6 or 7 times already.Initially. I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y. are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+"
7,"This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years."
1,"The first month of trying to get pregnant I used a more expensive clear blue digital test which didn't work properly as I kept getting errors of all sorts. I then got a cheap drug store brand which apparently didn't work either. I immediately ordered this for my next cycle. it was simple and easy to use. After my first try with it. I'm now 8 weeks pregnant. So what can I say. it works.Update 21/10/2013I'm sure it works!My son is now three years old so my husband and I decided we were ready to try again. So of course I turned to first response again. I bought a pack of these and used it for two cycles. They are pretty good so I was able to stretch it over two cycles. and to my surprise I'm pregnant again using these tests after two months."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
5,"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but. I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"
1,"Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this. I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand. or even Energizer. I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus. this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them. and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
5,"These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them. I use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better. but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although I change once a month anyway. I don't notice much difference at all though.But the best part is that these strings are over $17 bucks a set at my local music store and I get 'em for about $9.48 through Amazon's subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping! Beat that!"
12,"My friends and I got this when it first came out so long ago in like 99 or something like that.  Might have been earlier too.  Anyways. I played it through myself on Leon first and the game had an amazing storyline and the RPG part of the game is amazing.  There are a few challenging mini puzzles which can be very annoying. much like Zelda. but once you get past them all is well again.  I would highly recommened this game to anyone. and compared to the gore they have in nowadays games. this is nothing."
11,"If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game. this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces. all the cards. the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
6,"Overall. I believe this copy holder to be a good product.Pros*Good looking (although it will most likely be hidden behind copy or a book*Holds books flat (due to elastic band. and bottom lip)*wide enough for to hold two 8 1/2 x 11's*very sturdy (due to the heavy base)Cons*Seems the clear plastic could break (also due to the heavy base)*adjusting the angle is not as easy/accurate as it should beAlso of note: this won't work well as a cookbook holder because there is no splash guard for the books"
11,"What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game. or board game. As such. to play in tournaments. you need the extra expansions. and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship. extra pilots. extra droids. have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set. but for larger battles. this is needed for the Rebels."
11,"Great Game.  If you like bluffing. like poker. or confrontation games like Risk or Axis and Allies. this game is at the top of the class.  The main rule is that your alien character somehow circumvents and or otherwise breaks a rule or rules in the game.  The rules and the way the game plays allows for interesting player interaction.If you are looking for a game to get for someone that likes the bluffing and ante aspect of Poker then you will like this game.  Give it a try it's a classic and it's worth every penny."
3,"Between political struggles and his being a vegetarian. I was looking for a bit more on the spiritual side. After all. he was called Mahatma. Which means great soul. (This review has to be short.)Gandhi was confronted by Christians who wanted to sell him their twisted idea of Christianity. Actually he was greatly moved by Tolstoy's work; Tolstoy hated how Christians distort the teachings of Jesus. and are so anxious to wage war. Jesus taught 'love thy neighbor' and &#34;turn the other cheek&#34;.He struggled with diet. he refused to eat meat. eggs. and refused even milk. In the end he tried to subsist on fruit juices. Gandhi believed that abstinence was important in realizing God. yet he was disgusted by his own lust and how he treated his wife."
12,"I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.Well. my problem(s)?Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me )It's cheap now so. I guess it wouldn't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..so do what you want with it."
3,"Mother and daughter and daughter's younger friend. Apart from being well --- if a little old fashioned ---written this book is one remarkable journey that every woman MUST read and every man must experience. It's a grand romp in the best tradition and nary a deviation into the horrors of modern day handcuffs and whippings and similar. It stays sexy and it stays erotically on track. It takes place at the farm where the servants are sent out of vision and earshot and the main players ....play! Sex in the best tradition. Read it and if you don't get a serious twitch every time you do...I feel sorry for you."
8,"I have used Frontline on my dog for years. but this is the first time that I purchase Frontline Plus.  I cannot be certain that our problem is a direct result of the Frontline Plus. but my dog developed a growth and open wound at the place where this is applied.  I have contacted the company and they were very kind and made a report for their research.  However. the dog required medical attention and antibiotics.  Just wanted people to be aware to keep an eye on the application site just in case it was a direct result of this product."
7,"I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it.  I have used it about 5 times.  The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service. but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn.  It is very nice to put in a battery and go.  Battery life is good.  I can get about 20 minutes of hard use (briars. thick weeds) and about 40 minutes of light use (grass) out of a fresh battery.  The unit comes with two batteries.  I have changed the 'string' once and it was easy.  The trimmer is light and quiet. May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B&D cordless pole hedge trimmer.  They use the same battery. which is very helpful.  All and all very good product. if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer."
11,"First off. this game is a blast! I've played it a few times and every time is unique. challanging. fun. and most of all. it creates memorable moments. Word of warning. though. if you're new to more complex board games. this one's a doozy. but don't let that scare you away from the game. When learning how to play. it helps to have the board set up and sort of mock play a few turns. reading ALL the directions and playing through the scenarios the rules cover. The first game you actually play might move a bit slow at first. but once all the players learn how the turns work. the game moves along at a good clip."
6,"I am married to a woman who sells lots of things on Ebay.  She is also very conscious of recycling everything she can.  I work for a company that visual appeal when shipping something is almost everything. so when I reuse something. it better look new.  Sometimes. my wife asks me to package something up for her using an old packing envelope. that's fine but I either have to remove the old label or place the new one over the old one allowing you to see the old info.  To compromise. we decided to try these labels and much to my surprise. I can't see the old label under this one.  Yes they are a little more expensive. but it does make our marriage a little better."
12,"This game is simply amazing. you can't disagree. it is so fun. never repetative because everyday I would invite friends over to my house and we would play for hours and hours. The gameplay is great. if your into Melee it is similar but it takes a while getting use to the controls of the Gamecube. I was a master at this game. I loves it so much. a character I recommend that all beginners should use would be Fox. he is the easiest to use. but he is also very good if you can use him right. Jigglypuff and Ness are not for beginners. but Metronome might be the strongest move in the game. This is a fantastic game. unlock characters. set new records for your vs matches because every match you have goes down into the record column. This is a must have for N64 whether you are 10 or 20! Remember though. play with friends. not by yourself!"
6,"I like this phone so much that I bought a second one in white. It works well. does not require power to operate. and still has a few options of more expensive phones. By using a key combination. you can participate in 3-way calling. It has a mute button. volume control. Flash. auto redial. and can store up to 12 numbers in memory. It has an illuminated keypad and a 3-level ringer adjustment button. It is lighter than Trimline phones from the '80s. but it doesn't feel cheap. It's just that all of the analog parts inside from that decade have been replaced by digital ones. Even if this phone craps out after a year. it is so affordable that I consider it a &#34;disposable&#34; item. I recommend buying this item."
7,"This trap can actually catch mice. but if they aren't small. will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat. who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap. then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as 'starting fluid' in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
7,"This feeder I do really like. It helps me fight my squirrel problem &#34; but I do have some smart squirrels&#34;  a few have figured out ways to work around it but it is difficult and they don't stay very long. So it does work  and I like it.For any one who also has a raccoon problem you may want to try this one .  I know you told me up front in your detail about this feeder it was squirrel proof not raccoon proof .  But we were having a raccoon problem and this one he can't get off the pole and put on the ground or get the top off.  But you must be sure to close the top securely and tight.  I have two of these feeders now and the raccoon has stopped for now."
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
1,"There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would 'upgrade' to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I'll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
12,"I just loved RE 2 when it came out and even more scary then the first game. you play as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield.  there is one area in the Police station that when I went down a Hall..Scared the hell out of me and made me actually jump from my chair.  that's the type scare I enjoy.it was that good because you didn't expect it. every time I play this game and come to that place in the game  never fails to make me jump.. this game has two hidden characters.  Plus based on who you play Leon or Claire. you met two new characters in the game.I recommend this game to any fan of the Resident Evil series."
3,"Amy works way too hard as a lawyer and basically has no personal life.  The good side to her working so hard is always getting to see Justin. a man she's wanted for years.  Amy and Justin end up having to go to Hawaii to finalize a case they've been working on.  Little does Amy know that Justin has wanted her since the day he saw her.  While in Hawaii he intends to make his feelings known and give her one of her secret fantasies.The book wasn't very long. but it was very sweet.  There was a good relationship between Amy and Justin and very little drama.  Both characters were nice. had great chemistry. and seemed believable.  There wasn't a ton of information in the book either. but since the characters had known each other for years the way things happened in the book didn't seem unrealistic.  If you want a sweet. sexy story this is a good one that won't leave you feeling depressed."
5,"Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed."
5,"I was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars. but thought I would just be careful with it.  But I have no concerns after using it on two string changes.  In fact. I cannot see how one could nick the guitar while winding. since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head.  The string cutter works great. one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly.  The pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works. and though it is a tighter fit than I expected. it does work and means I don't need to find a pliers.  Overall. I am very pleased and saved time on string changes."
10,"Overall. this is an 'ok' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the 'up and over' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects. and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
2,"This is not a kitchen essential. but I love it.  I only bought it to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promotion. and as it turns out. I use it almost everyday.  I have had it for over a year. and it still looks like new.  I rarely use the dishwasher. so I wash mine by hand.  I probably wouldn't bother putting something like this in the dishwasher anyway.I like to bake. and I use the spreader to spread butter over the dough for cinnamon rolls. spread pizza sauce over pizza dough. and I have used it a couple of times to put the frosting on cupcakes.  What a great tool for 5 bucks!"
3,"Up until the point where the author wrote that the Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church did nothing to help the Jews. the story was engrossing. However. the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries. Hundreds of priests went to the death camps for speaking out against Hitler.I. a Jewish woman. gave this book one star because of this major flaw."
7,"I hadn't put out a feeder for several years. but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights. making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small. affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon. they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted."
1,"Not much to say here. but I like when products I'm looking at have reviews.These are durable. good. effective... Basically. they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator. Also. they are inexpensive. I will definitely buy these again when I need more!Note: They may seem stiff at first. but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use. It took me a while to figure that out. I think it's on the package. but I don't remember.Anyways. good product. 5 stars!"
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
3,"This is a sweet book about Zhadist and what he does to put his past behind him so that he can have the future he truly wants with his mate and child.And what a mate he has.  She is perfect for him.  Understanding and loving and willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her child and assure the future she deserves.  She is strong and determined and yet loving and accepting for Zhadist as he is as well as the horrible past that has molded him into the person he is now.And what love Zhadist has for Bella.  He is willing to do whatever must be done to exorcise his demons so he can give her and his child the life they deserve.  A truly touching story of love.This story is a must read for any BDB fans."
5,"I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick. but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This. of course. can be very annoying. especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto. great for leads. and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost."
8,"My 15 year-old 80# mixed-breed dog had slowed down noticeably. I followed the directions on the package but didn't see much difference after 2 weeks. At the end of the third week of feeding these treats once a day Herbie started running again. At the end of the month. he is romping and playing with my other dog like he is a puppy. I just watched him take the stairs 2 steps at a time. It seems like these treats took longer to work but once they kicked in my arthritic old dog now thinks he is a strapping young man."
10,"I have never had a sander like this before. but when I was refinishing a desk for a lady . I decided to get one. I compared several other units and decided on this one. I love the variable speed and with a course grit belt. it made light work of the 3 coats of paint I had to remove. it is very maneuverable  and the dust catcher works great also.  I used a light grit belt and some light hand sanding  for the polyurethane finish and the lady's words were: &#34;you turned my old desk into a thing of beauty&#34;  ."
6,"I'm not real sure what I'm supposed to say about this stuff in a review. I mean. is there anybody in the United States who isn't familiar with Scotch tape? It's the grand daddy of all cellophane tapes. and this gift wrap tape just adds a couple features that make Scotch tape better and better. First. it's a handy three pack. just in time for Christmas and assuring even the biggest of gift givers enough tape to wrap everything. Then. there's the satin finish. which becomes darn near invisible on patterned paper. and pretty close to that on everything else. Finally. it sticks. This is a great product. and I don't see how I couldn't give it five stars."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is really awesome. but how awesome? Is it the best of the Legend of Zelda series so far? Oh. undeniably. but that is not the point. My point is that it was the best game for the Nintendo 64. with Super Mario 64 and its direct sequel. Majora's Mask in a second place draw. It shows how the franchise began. Link sets off on a journey to save Hyrule from the evil Ganondorf for the first time. He meets Princess Zelda on the way. and when she flees from Ganondorf. she leaves the Legendary Ocarina of Time in Link's possession. He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword. The graphics were neat for the time. the storyline was really exciting. and there is a lot of stuff to collect. The dungeons were challenging. and the boss fights are neat. If you are a fan of Nintendo. please pick this up. You will be glad you did."
5,"I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents.  Besides the risk to my guitar. there is the cost.  For the price I paid for this guitar. I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents.  I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it. and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits.  It has much better tone than I expected. and very good action.  Stays in tune very well.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party."
12,"They really hit the mark on this one!... characters. storyline. play. music. graphics... everything just superb for its time!  I played this game over and over again just to play it.  It's a fun game. but out of all the times I played it I could never defeat the Ruby Weapon.  I think he's like impossible or something! LOL  But even so. that wasn't much of a let down because the rest of the game was so cool.  And Sephiroth... what a perfect villan.  He looked pretty cool!  If you've never played any of the FF series (and even if you have). this is a definite 'must have'!"
6,"I have always liked Scotch brand products and this one is no different. I like that you get three rolls of this tape because if you are like me one is never enough when wrapping gifts. I love that the dispenser is easy to use. The tape comes off the roll very easily which is a huge plus in my opinion. I also love that the gift wrap tape is clear when you place in onto the wrapping paper. It makes the gifts a lot more appealing considering that you don't have to look at tape 'lines'. In my opinion the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is the best tape for wrapping gifts this holiday season.If you want a tape that is easy to use and looks great on your gifts look no further than Scotch Gift Wrap Tape. I do not think that you will be disappointed."
8,"I have two Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies (5mo & 10mo) and they LOVE the Galileo Bone in the 'Souper' size. They grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight. It seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it. the more they enjoy it. It doesn't make a mess when they're chewing. the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers. but don't break off.  I don't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers. It's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in. It would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one. I'm ordering a second one so they don't have to share it anymore! :)"
2,"Before buying this product. I used an apple corer and divider. I hated using it because I'm petite and it would take me 5 minutes of using all of my strength to core the apple and have it cut into wedges. I am starting to eat healthier and decided to buy this apple corer to see if I liked it better. I love the OXO Good Grips Corer! It takes just seconds to core the apple and the core is easy to remove from the corer. The handle is comfy and easy to grip. Cleaning the corer is also easy. I use this to core small and medium-sized apples and the core comes out completely. However. I do not think the core will come completely out with larger-sized apples because of the size of the head. Overall. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,"This was a great follow up to King of Prey. The main character in this is the right hand man of the King of Hawks. Sachin meets his mate when she is to young to claim but he continues to visit her as she grows up. After mistakes are made and trust is lost Sachin must figure out what he wants and how to hang on to it.I liked how this book went with a different approach to how the main characters meet and their relationship progresses. There was no instant love with them flying off into the sunset. It was a more real love with a undeniable passion between the two that is common in the paranormal romances. I enjoyed following both characters and learning about them. their pasts and their futures.Again I love this series and so far out of all the books this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this to fans of Paranormal Romance or shifter stories.*I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*"
7,"No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail. one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it. it did not hold. would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket. two L-shaped arms. six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)"
6,"I needed this for my daughter. for school work. The paper is pretty good &#8211; it&#8217;s not the really thick paper I remember from my own youth. which was so course that I could actually see the pulp fibers in it with the naked eye! Its thinness reminds me more of the paper I used in college (in the Stone Age. before everyone had a computer).I don&#8217;t think that the paper is unusually thin. It seems to me to be good. normal. wide ruled paper. We are already using it for some work and we are happy enough with it.(Review of Mead Filler Paper. Wide Ruled)"
1,"I bought these in a pack of 6 using Amazon Prime and considered it a great deal.  I need saline spray after having a septoplasty 4 weeks ago and this saline rinse fits the bill.The shape of the bottle and the nozzle are better engineered than Ocean (in my opinion).  This bottle provides a nice. gentle spray.  Great stuff and very good at moisturizing the mucosa.  Does what it was meant to do.I used this heavily after a septoplasty surgery and also imagine it would be good for those using a CPAP machine dealing with dry noses.  I prefer this over Ocean and some of the other saline sprays because the bottle format is actually nice and delivers a very consistent mist of saline.  The 'fatter' ocean bottles always feel like they get squeezed in the middle and become more difficult to use as the bottle gets emptier.I like this brand the best -- great stuff!"
6,"This paper trimmer looks cheap (the body is gray plastic). but is sturdy and reliable and more than meets all our small office needs. Love the grid that helps you keep the paper straight. If you need more than a few sheets at a time cut. or other features like a spring-loaded arm. you should invest in a more expensive heavy-duty trimmer. But this is more than adequate for us and a welcome addition to our office equipment. as I can't cut a straight line with scissors to save my life!"
12,"This game is one of the only games to truly terrify me. (the other being silent hill. check my review on that in upcoming weeks!)  The graphics are just right for this type of game. although they could have been better.  The control is muddy. although never cumbersome.  the weapons are alright. but upgrading them is a hoot.  I wish that you could upgrade more weapons. though.  An upgraded rocket launcher that could blow through doors. now that would be really...' cool!!!  Oh well. If I want to do that. I should go play Red Faction.  The zombies are as dumb as oxes. but the lickers and dogs and the birds (THEY ARE COMING TO GET ME!!!!) are fairly intelligent.  avoid those at all costs. if you know what is good fer ya.  adios!"
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
8,"I left a review regarding Petmate Purrforma jumbo. it was a smelly.horrible mess. Well. I got lucky. My PetSmart told me to bring the Purrforma back and they would credit all toward a new Littermaid and supplys for it. There was even enough credit left for 2 30# bags of the Nutro dog food I use. The Puurforma is so overpriced as well as poorly designed. I had the receipt for the Puurforma from the month before. I now have my 3rd multicat Littermaid and am very happy again. While not perfect. as litter cleaning will never be perfect. these do work well for me. I have one in the laundry room. one downstairs and the other at my farm. I have yet to find a cat that will not use this box. My cats at home are all over 10 years old. At the farm they are 2 years and younger. Hope this helps."
7,"The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks. not the claimed three months. and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them.  I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard.  Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well.  I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger. I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved."
11,"My Twilight-obsessed teenage daughter and her friends played this game several times.They enjoyed the trivia questions. but preferred to dispense with the game board. They were more interested in the clips and outdoing each other with their vast Twilight knowledge than the details of the board game itself. They especially enjoyed the fact that all three movies released to date were included in this edition.That being said. it is a great sleepover game for teenage girls who are in to Twilight (aren't they all)? If you're looking for a great tween gift or planning a party or sleepover. this is a good choice."
12,"If you see this game around Immediatly purchase it on the spot. this game can provide hours and hours of multiplayer fun. (1 player is boring but better than playing multiplayer by lonesome) there a alot of unlockable characters that are pretty cool here tehy are: Captain Falcon from F-zero series. Ness from the rare Earthbound series. Jigglypuff from pokemon. Luigi from the Mario Bros. series. And if you have a gameshark there are cool codes the allow you to be the boss of the Smash Bros. titles. (Master Hand) and you could also be Metal Mario with a Gameshark. cool huh? have fun and train. This isn't one of those titles you can just rent and enjoy you gotta own it for it to be fun."
5,"I haven't measured signal throughput so I can't comment on that.  But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle.  This thing simply will not crimp. will not kink up on itself. does not get twisted and has no tension in it.  It's the easiest handling cable I've ever dealt with. a real pleasure when you've got all kinds of wires running all over.  It's like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy. and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections.I have a 10-footer with one right-angle connection. and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster."
6,"As address labels these do everything you'd expect them to do - you can print names and addresses on your printer. peel them off easily. and stick securey to envelopes. If your wordprocessor doesn't have a template for them. one can be downloaded from [...].However I also used these labels for another purpose - organziing several closets. No longer do I have to remember which sheld the fitted king sized sheets are on and which is the fitted queen sheets - just print out what you need on these labels. stick them to the front of the shelves. and you're done. (Just use a nice large readable font). I reorganized the linen closet. hall closet. and basement closet using them and I couldn't be happier."
7,"This little light is easy to assemble. needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw. Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object. it stays put.  It doesn't wobble or come undone.  The cord is five feet long.  Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant. the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24' from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage. and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!  This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children.  However. set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb. packed in its separate cardboard support."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
12,"I have both this game AND Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance. And I love them both as much as the other. Tetris worlds my not have a Battery Back-up. but it more than makes up for that with the extremely fun game variations and the classic tetris Music.Tetris DX DOES Have a battery. but it's just basic tetris. I'm able to score at least 400.000 points regularly. so every time I top out I have to put up with that annoying rocket launch sequence. wheras with Tetris Worlds. when you top out. you can start the next game right away without having to put up with annoying rocket sequences. the bottom line: went I want to play Classic Tetris. I play Tetris DX. when I want Enhanced graphics and effects and Nostalgic Music. I play Tetris Worlds"
8,"I have tried both products and for me this one seems to work the best. It keeps fleas away and ticks. I also use this with the Vibrac Preventic Tick collars. Before I started using this and the Preventic Collar. I was always finding ticks on my dogs. 5 and 6 at a time and they would be totally engorged by then. Now. I may find one or 2 baby ones on them. but get them before they can really bite the dogs. because something in this product repels them. so I really am a believer in this. I totally have seen the difference and can't live without it. I stock up on it because it runs out of stock often."
6,"Although my ordering of this product was totally accidental I decided to keep it since it is such a wonderful product.  I just will not run out of tape for quite a while.  I would highly recommend this product and remember the most expensive label makers are not necessarily the best.2-16-2012I did not open this product right away but when I did I found the incorrect item had been sent not just by one company but two; neither of which are Amazon.com.  I have actually stopped doing business with one company because they would not allow me to return the item."
8,"I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews.  First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart...very cumbersome.  However having said this the green light was on.  I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate. 7 am every 24 hours.  I had to wait until the next day. well it never rotated.  Also the lid is very easy to move.  I have a Bengal cat. even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it.  I needed the feeder as we are going away.  However I returned it.  I will look for other options.  Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews.  Save your time and effort. this product is not worth the trouble"
2,"For my husbands and I's first Christmas I asked for a potato masher. He got this exact one and I can say that I've used it once a week for 10 years and its still perfect. The handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything. I love all the Oxo products. they really do last years and years. I've bought other companies products for the kitchen and they fall apart. is I specifically look for Oxo Good Grips whenever I go get a kitchen gadget because I know it will last for years. One tip. after you mash the potatoes rinse off the potato from the masher because once that potato dries it takes alot of work to remove."
7,"I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps. bees. etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise. great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy. so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb."
11,"The first time I played the game with 2 other players. who both thought they were smarter than me and laughed at me when I asked questions on how they interpreted the rules.  One of my opponents had played the game prior to our &#34;match&#34; on more than one occasion.  It turned out. I had interpreted the rules correctly and missed many opportunities to play the way I should have been &#34;allowed&#34; to play. but I still beat the other two players.  I would play every day if I could.  Great game for mental stimulation. motor skills. strategy. etc."
6,"So. I won't.  I can. however. get excited about the value you'll get on Amazon.If you need bubble wrap for shipping at a good price. this is a good deal.Note: Most bubble wrapping will stick to your shipped product if you're sending it across state/country in 100+ degree weather. the product material is susceptible to it (glossy book cover. plastics. etc.)and the barrier between the wrapping and the outside of the shipping container is minimal in thickness.  Be aware of this and cover your product with something prior to applying the bubble wrap to ensure your product won't stick to it (i.e. a single layer of wrapping tissue around the product)"
12,"This game is fun for the exact opposite reason that Metal Gear Solid is fun.  In this game stealth isn't of much importance. while quickly killing all the bad guys on the screen is important.  Like most action games this one is staged out into many different missions. which usually have five or six objectives in order throughout the level. My personal favorite aspect of this game is the target system which locks on to the enemy of your choice making the game easier in a crowded room of enemies.  Syphon Filter is one great pure action game."
2,"I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean.  This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean.  As soon as it arrived I went to my local hardware store and replaced all of the screws with stainless steel because that seem to be a problem with other users.  I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure. I had a pot of beans.  The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you can't fill it too much.  I just love my new pressure cooker.  Looking forward to many great meals."
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
2,"I've been vacuuming for over 40 years and I enjoy trying new products.I have a myriad of machines. from $100.00 to $1400.00.  No matter what I try. Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.  The ergonomics are perfect. but the singularly winning aspect of this machine is it's strong suction and firm grabbing power as you pull it back toward yourself. It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble. re-arrange. clean or empty trays. reassemble. etc.  I just tap the 'On' button. release the handle and go.  I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go."
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
8,"I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is a chew-maniac. I bought this bear hoping it would last a bit longer than most. based on good things I have heard about the Kong brand. It's been about a month and a half now. and he has ripped out the pouch for the replaceable squeaker (the squeaker itself was the 1st thing to go- in the first week). but the squeaker in the bear's head is still there. Aside from that. the rest of the bear is fully intact. My pup treats it with care. not biting as hard as usual when playing tug of war. He also plays fetch with it. but surprisingly does not chew it. I have seen him licking it and carrying it around though. When I get home from work. he often greets me at the door with a toy already in his mouth. and this bear is definitely one of his favorites."
11,"I thought my one year old would be super into this. he loves sticking things into slots. However he is barely interested in it. Partly because someone has to hold down the flimsy foam bottom while putting them in. And you have to push them in really hard into the foam to get them to stay. which he still can hardly do at almost 2. Then you still have to push fairly hard to put them on top of each other. though they still stand up somewhat if you don't click them in all the way. We are disappointed as there were many of these types of things to choose from and I am sure some of the others are better. And they are definitely overpriced."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
12,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  &quot;Why am I playing this?&quot;  &quot;Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!&quot;Buy then and only then."
7,"I am  Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening. I never test my ground.  Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated. I could not be bothered.  I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit.  Until I moved. this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect. until this year.  Nothing wants to grow. so I broke down and bought this item. low an behold I have a problem. nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing.  I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all. (but we really don't.)"
11,"We bought this as a part of homeschooling our 4th grader.It required some of my help for holding things in place while my daughter built the circuit. but she could complete 90% of the work herself.  The &#34;inventions&#34; worked well (minor shortcomings in the blinking light circuit. but it wasn't a big deal to us).The telegraph was a bit trickier since the placement of the &#34;clicker&#34; had to be just right for it to work.  But. it was a good challenge for us because my 4th grader really appreciated the lesson that some (or most) things don't work on the first (or the second or third) try.  We kept fiddling with it until it worked.  When it worked. it was really satisfying.We learned a lot about simple circuits from this kit!"
12,"This one started it all so it is the most popular. It has great graphics for the 64 and the sound is amazing. I loved all of the super smash bros series and to this day these r my favorites for each system. It has a great multiplayer game and the stages r very creative. The only bad thing about the game is that there r only 12 charecters and not that many stages but remember this is the first one. If u look at the front it looks like a kiddie game but thats what all of the nintindo games looked like back then. The graphics r so good that sometimes u cant tell this on and the melle games apart."
11,"There is a reason that &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; has sold over 2 million copies and has won numerous awards in several countries. I had not even heard of this board game until recently but after receiving it from Amazon last week our whole family became addicted and we have played it almost every day.  It's simple enough so that young children can learn it but has enough strategy that there are entire web sites dedicated to playing it more thoughtfully.  It really is a great game.The only negative aspect is the high cost.  I bought it from Amazon and that was still expensive.  Ebay and others want between $40-$50 for it.  It's just a board. cards. and plastic pieces - no justification for the price.  If you can get past that - there are no other downsides.  I'm glad we bought it."
11,"My son is almost two and has had these on his magnet board in his playroom for a few months now. He likes the farmer and the tractor magnets the best and we use the animals to work with animal sounds often. These are small (which I know. it's in the description). The artwork is pretty cute and the magnet part does it's job. They come in really cute packaging...my friend used them in her little one's Easter basket. which was great visual display. But really for $18 they are more of an item I'd expect to find in an overpriced Boutique. Once they get out of the cute carton packaging they are just your ordinary $1 bin magnets."
2,"My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.  I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.  It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.  This book teaches colors as each of the butterflies finds a place to stay for the night.Update - My daughter is now well grown but this book sticks in my mind still - we read it so many times.  I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young."
10,"I just got the jig saw and right away was impressed with how well it cut. I've always had the cheap jig saws...since for a jig saw you only need a machine that moves the blade up and down right?....WRONG! You need a blade guide that stabalizes the cutting edge. you need a powerfull machine behind it to provide a consistant speed stroke. you need a balanced machine to avoid fatique and not have the machine vibrate.  Also. the Bosch blades cut like butter thru the wood.  I was able to make repetative 1/8th cuts in pine without the blade wandering and I was holding the wood on the bench only with my hand..hardly any vibration."
12,"Ape Escape is an awesome game with amazing graphics and great storyline. The game has over 200 different monkeys. each with hilarious attitudes. This was (no doubt) my favorite game of all time. cuz I just love playing adventure/platform games. This game is not easy to beat if you want to complete it 100%. There are time trials for almost every level and cool mini-games. It took me over a month to beat the game 100%. but I'm just an average gamer. I recommend this game. cuz it's fun. exciting. cool. and CHEAP $$$!"
2,"I purchased Several OXO Good Grips including a Lemon/Lime Reamer. Cheese Plane. Wire Potato Masher and Box Grader.  They were all reasonably priced and are made of good quality material.  The potato masher is the best that I have ever used and I use it for everything.  I like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon.  Add a can of black olives in the mix and mash them up also.  I would recommend this brand.  The handle has a nice grip and is nice and soft.  I considered this brand because I have the wire whisks and other products by OXO."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
11,"I bought this game based on numerous glowing reviews of it. however i was somewhat dissapointed in it.Pros:-Deep. engaging game with tons of replayability.-Lots of character choices-Tons of expansions to keep even veteran players happy-Once you know how to play. the game is very easy to understandCons-Incredibly complicated. This game has hundreds (thousands with expansions) of pieces. and setup and tear down is very long.-The board is absolutely massive. It did not fit on my regular dinner table with all the pieces. and the expansions make it even larger.-learning how to play is not easy. and its not something you can just pull out and teach someone."
8,"This stuffed frog is for &#34;small&#34; dogs. and I mean small. It is very small. and my dog is 12 lbs. and she loves it. She loves tiny toys. I estimate this toy is best for mini-pets like Chihuahua or small (under 10 lbs). I didn't actually see this one from Amazon because I ordered it for my best friend's new puppy who live in CA. I saw this at Petsmart and loved it. It is very cute. and from memory. it is about 3+ inches tall. The fur is soft. and I believe it also has a squeak in it."
1,"For the price. this product isn't that bad. but don't expect too much from it.  The 'massage' basically amounts to it vibrating a lot. which can feel somewhat nice. but not as much as I had expected.  As a runner. I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end.  The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all.  You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However. being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice. and I do use it occasionally.  I just don't think it should have been labeled as a'Pro Ultra.'  There's nothing really 'ultra' about it."
7,"Living near the woods. we have all kinds of critters:  chipmunks. squirrels. rabbits. racoons. and deer.  In addition there is my nutty dog. so I don't want to use anything toxic around her.  Deer Off has non toxic ingredients. and so far seems to repel the critters. though it's still early in the season and I haven't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather.  I especially like that Deer Off doesn't require mixing. an improvement over products I've used in past years.  So far so good. but I'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted."
6,"Need new business cards fast? Don't want to pay for rush printing and shipping? Then these cards could just be what you need.I had no problems setting up the cards to print. Of course. as always. there are a couple of things you should keep in mind:1.) Do not tear the cards apart when you are done. 'Snap' them apart by bending them toward you.2.) Place one sheet in your printer at a time.Yes. these tips are printed right there in the instructions. But looking through the 1 and 2 Star reviews on Amazon. I think a few people missed those helpful tidbits before they wasted paper and ink.Of course. I didn't need the whole 80 for my emergency card run. Now my son gets some nifty new Math Facts flash cards!"
8,"I initially bought this item to help with the minor pain I get daily from inflammation.  However. I find it works ok for the inflammation. not as good as I had hoped. but by surprise it certainly helps with my night sweats and hot flashes.  They have decreased immensely and I don't feel so uncomfortable when I'm shopping and break out into a great sweat.  Not sure which item in this does the trick. but I'm one happy camper.  I sleep better too!  Give it a try. it's not a bad price either."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
6,"If you are resusing old file folder these are the absolute best.  There is NO bleed through of whatever is written behind it. even if written in dark black sharpie.The labels have some sort of coating on the back that really does block everything out.You can quickly find a template in Word by typing in 8366 in the search box after you do 'File' 'New'.When using these templates I always select the whole document and have the edges of the cells of the tables filled in so that I can tell where the edge of the label is while typing ( In Word 2007 this is under the Home tab in the Paragraph section. it looks like a little 4 square box with the bottom underlined).  Chose 'All borders'.  You can then go back and Chose 'No borders' when done if you do not want the borders printed."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
1,"I've used an Oral B since 1993. and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally 'burned' out a few years ago. and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room. and it conveniently got 'lost' (hope the maid is enjoying it). as when I called that afternoon. 'nothing had been found'...These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said. the dentist's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally. I always brush on high speed until it beeps. then I switch to low speed. and re-brush. and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool. from a Reliable Mfg.. Not to be Beaten! If you've not used one of these. by all means. GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE. NOW!! You'll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin"
11,"okay so i am in love with the wizard of oz! and when i started to inot the world of Fluxx. i knew i had to buy myself a copy of the game. i had played star fluxx and wanted that but when OZ popped up. i couldn't say no! the box of cards come in perfect shape. but after a few days the box started to rip on the sides. ive had to type them. but the cards remain in great shape. it's a fun game of never ending change. and is a great party game. once you understand the basic's your golden."
6,"This oil comes in a plastic container with a nozzle that makes it easy to lubricate the shredder. Yes. it is outrageously priced but it does the job it supposed to do. I just don't believe a product should be given a poor rating because of the price. I do believe that price is a factor in the purchase decision but not in the product itself. But. that's just my opinion. When I run out of the Fellowes lubricant I will refill the container with vegetable oil because of the price but not because of the quality of the Fellowes oil."
10,"Please see my review on DeWalt DW 9043 bulb. as most of that applies here.  Bulb worked great. but runs very hot.  Lens very hot. after 2-3 seconds touch. reflector about the same.  Metal hinge/holder too hot to touch.  Some plastic smell in first 10 minute inspection.  Checked again at 1 hour 5 minutes (total test time) and still the same. No scorched or melted plastic.  A winner...UPDATE April27/12:  Still working great with normal drops and bangs.lens heat not an issue...  UPDATE  dec 31. 2012:  Wow. this bulb is tough thru drops and bangs from daily use; I wish I could find a girlfriend that was as bright and hot (and lasted as long) as this bulb."
3,"This book confused me from the beginning all the way to the end. It starts without any pre story. You dont know anything about any of the characters. all you get is this woman who is scared of men. these two 'hot' guys that work with the girl a best friend who sets something!!! up. it doesnt really say until it gets hot and steamy. So its 0 to 10 in all of 3 seconds. This book lacked details that developed the characters and not knowing details made it seem very unbelivable."
11,"This just seems like one of those instant classic toys. We starting using the Elf on the Shelf last year after our kids were asking about why we did not get an elf and so-and-so does. Within days it felt like we had been using the elf toy for years. Our children enjoy the hunt each morning. especially if Elf has been mischievous during the night. This always brings out big laughs. It does not take much effort to find a place for Elf to be each morning. No worries if Elf decides to stay put two days in a row...it must be a comfortable spot. Notably. Elf's legs have creases to bend. but the arms do not. That said. you can fold the arms. they just do not have creases built in."
6,"There is a lot of debate on whether you should just buy cheap canola oil for your shredder or more expensive shredder oil.  I'm sure both work fine. but is the $5-6 price tag on this really worth taking the chance?  For a moderate home user. 12oz of Shredder Oil will last probably longer than your shredder (maybe two shredders).  I for one think that this is a small price to pay to protect my $250+ Fellowes Micro Cut Shredder.  As far as the product goes. it works great.  I have had my shredder for a couple of years with moderate use and there has been no build-up of oil or slow downs in its function.  It is still working as well and as quiet as it did on the first day.  I use the oil every bag change or if I haven't used it in a few weeks.  Great product at a reasonable price."
6,"One of my summer projects was to file. re-file. and re-organize existing files. Not the most pleasant task in the world. One of the things I wanted to avoid this time around was my messy hand written tab titles for the hanging folders.Voila!These Avery computer generated tab title thing-a-me-bobs are exactly what was needed! Download the template. type the titles. print out and attach- couldn't be easier.I love it when simple products perform their designated task well and make my life just a little bit easier."
11,"Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road.....perfect!  With grandparents it kind of starts a 'conversation' where they can come up with a word. or my kids can. and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant.  Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic. so things like this really make a huge difference (tic tac toe as well). And at $12 you will not be annoyed at the price.  Totally worth every penny. Yes. I'm annoyed the pen is already dried out. but yes. any Sharpie will do. Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens. would have paid at least $1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top (no need for a tissue). A great product!"
12,"I understand that this is an original. but there are some things I didn't quite like with this game. In the Unknown Dungeon. I climbed a set of stairs and then ended up in a wall! I couldn't move anywhere except for out of it and back to the previous level. Eventually I managed to get up without being forced into the wall. Also. most of the game is Blue if played on the Game Boy Color or Advance systems. Gameplay. music. and the story are all extraordinarily great for a Game Boy title."
8,"I love Frontline Plus for my cats. but it gets expensive. And then when I moved to a new neighborhood I found a few stray cats too. Before finding them new homes. I had to use flea control meds and it definitely got expensive.  I'm so glad this was created.  I just hope that something like this can be created for the oral medication for Program too.  I have some feral cats I can't touch and mixing Program in with their food is the only thing I can do. and that gets pricey too.  I'm very blessed I make good money. but still..."
7,"As an avid griller and lover of cooking on charcoal. I can't say enough good things about the Weber Chimney starter.This simple to use chimney style starter quickly lights enough lump or briquette charcoal to fill your 22 1/2 inch weber grill WITHOUT LIGHTER FLUID!!Lighting is easy. Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney. place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal. use this puppy to light your coals. and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier. I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.  On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again.  A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill."
5,"This is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars. The upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over. The stand can be used with or without the upper brace. On mine. the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as I'd like it to be. Also. the &#34;feet&#34; don't spread as wide apart as I'd hoped. A few more inches would have been appreciated. All in all. a good but not &#34;perfect&#34; stand."
10,"I've had mine for years and it works great. I use primarily at the Miter Saw since that's the only tool in my shop that is stationary. For any small shop it works great. This used to be my DC for my basement shop before I moved into the garage. The only problem I had with it was on my belt/disc sander. It didn't pick up the dust that well but the there was roughly 25 feet of hose and PVC to go thru. Not the DC's fault. Overall. I'd recommend it for any small shop"
12,"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long."
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
12,"...  In more ways then one. it trys to match the style and fun of Goldeneye. but fails miserably.  Considering this game was made after Goldeneye. you would think it would at least have quality graphics. but no.  Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating. where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character.  The missions are vrey booring too.  This game is very hard even on the 'possible' setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game."
7,"This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries. there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver. then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries. put circuit board and switches back in. insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each). hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this. because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries. you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle."
10,"I have had the saw for over half a year now. Indeed the tool assembles well. the overall instructions are clear. and the cutting is excellent. However there are some flaws that are rather anoying. The fence moves when clamped making any fine adjustment tedious. the on/off switch bracket keeps on coming loose. The plastic plugs at the end of the extrusions etc. pop out all the time and the blade guard with the splitter is impossible to align. In frustration I had to just remove that system because long pieces if wood kept on wedging the blade. Final conclusion: good saw with some anoying defects. I think that there are better deals on the market offering a superior overall quality."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
10,"Yup. it goes in my trunk. or in my truck. It is that important. And. the Milwaukee Offset head fits in the carry case with the extra battery and charger. So. if you are like me. and you must have the proper tool for the job. And the job must be done right. Well then. here is another Milwaukee that is a must have! When you get it. buzz your name right into the outside of the case with your Dremel. And you will be set for many. many satifying years to come. Good Luck. and God Bless."
3,"Ok. I know it's free and shouldn't complain... but sometimes I just can't help myself. Does that make me a bad person? No. just an honest one.  At first It was ok....not bad. but then I signed up for some REAL blogs and discovered that yes...BAD. and getting worse! It's a waste of my time to read about a cooking utensil for something I will never cook or a designer's clothes I will never be able to afford.  There are occasionally some info on books. but I can certainly find that on my own.  Seriously. kitchen utensils. what the celebrities wore at a concert and Korean cooking(which is quite frequently blogged about) are not things that I will miss after canceling my &#34;subscription&#34;.  But hey. That's just me!DawnBee &#60;3(you get what you pay for)"
1,"I bought this lotion after a friend recommended it.  After my first use. the ammonia smell was too much to bear....it cut clear through my clogged nasal passages (I have a really bad cold).  Perhaps I should have known this ammonia scent would happen since ammonium lactate is the 2nd listed ingredient...but for some reason. I did not review the ingredients list so it didn't even occur to me.  This lotion is so very expensive that I expected something different.  Due to the very prominent ammonia smell. I couldn't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.  Surely there is a more pleasant way to exfoliate and moisturize."
8,"In 1994 One of my heavy-chewing Samoyed dogs had a deadly episode with a Nylabone toy.  When I made the President of the Nylabone company aware of the problem with his product. he was extremely cooperative.  He not only undertook settling all the medical expenses but a couple of months later sent my dog a Galileo Souper with an attached note that read:  'Our team of engineers have come up with Galileo. the toughest dogbone around. created just for hard chewers like Rajah.  This is the first bone off the production belt for him.  I hope he is well now and will enjoy Galileo.''Silver Frost Rajah' has since passed away of old age. but his offsprings and currently his grand-puppies are enjoying it.  And. except for some teeth-scrapes. the Galileo is STILL intact !"
3,"I wasn't familiar with Piper until I happened across this 99 cent kindle compilation of five short stories (although I had read the first story 'Genesis' at some point in the distant past).  These are great examples of true classic sci fi stories. originally published in '50s pulp magazines.By and large. the stories hold up well but there are a few 'future' technology details that seem dated.  And like much pulp sci fi from the fifties you can see the unfortunate influence of McCarthyism; but. as with much older fiction if you can get past that and accept it as a reality of the time it was written. the story is very enjoyable.This inexpensive kindle editon is very well formated.  This little book serves as a great introduction to Piper or just as a quick read when you are in the mood for classic pulp stories."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
6,"That makes this my first Costco purchase.  I have a one person household so a mountain of toilet paper isn't that attractive.  I'll say though. it was a bit of a shock to see Costco using Amazon.  They seem to have an active site of their own.As to the paper. it is a nice bright white that I don't have to be embarrassed using.  It is the right weight to go through my laser.  So. 3 to 5 stars are certainly in order.  I went with the middle but could have gone higher. if &#34;Loving&#34; paper had a bit better connotation."
1,"I have white tile in all the bathrooms. and the grout gets stained. Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally. Not my favorite job. but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner. I think it works better than commercial sprays and it's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle (not one use previously for bleach; I would suggest buying a clean. new bottle at the hardware store.) Spray on. scrub. Do not ever mix with bleach; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly."
11,"This game is so fun. Being a guy that used play D&D; back in the day but doesn't have the time to play a game that lasts 3+ hours. this is the perfect alternative. You can play with up to five friends or play alone controlling two characters since the monsters are controlled by cards that determine the attacks.It always is unpredictable due to the innovative random tile sets. You can also easily design your own adventures as well.Tons of replay. always action based. not to complex to learn and lots of fun!"
12,"I think it's too late to give a review on this game. but here goes. This is the most perverted game ever made. When you think about it. it's pretty disgusting. 'Aim for the open spot!'. 'I'll do you fast. Peppy old pal.'. 'Fox. get this guy off me!' 'I've got a present for ya!' EEEEEEEEEUUU! Should kids be playing these games?Anyway. the gameplay is fun...for 15 minutes. Then it's bothersome. annoying. and dull. Your team mates have the worst A.I. ever. and they don't get power-ups. The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short. Like. 30 minutes short. Also. the voice acting sucks.I hope Starfox Adventures will be good. This game shouldn't have started the whole Starfox thing. If so. it needed work."
10,"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee. unbelievably. does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because. in my first shipment. one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an 'XPR' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered. while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
6,"I create presentation boards for design presentations and I often find myself needing to affix a piece of marble. tile or carpet to the board. Glue doesn't hold and regular tape is a joke. Scotch mounting tape. however. does the job. Normally if I affix a piece of marble it has fallen off of the board by the end of the day - I have marble still sticking to the board weeks later and no signs of letting go. This tape is amazing and. though I can't say for sure. it truly seems to be a permanent tape. Highly recommended."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
8,"As a big fan of the Dr. Noys toy line. I was quite disappointed when this bear arrived. After searching in the bottom of the box for it. I found it drowning in the peanuts (just kidding). This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix. and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated. Still. our dog has tossed it around. and I've found Dr. Noy's toys to be quite durable."
8,"I used Advantage for years on our outdoor cats and always dreaded the monthly trial of applying it.  It was messy. smelled. and neither the cats nor I enjoyed it.  I started using Program a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier.  There's a lot of liquid in the monthly dose. but I mix it up with some wet food and the cats don't even know it's there.  They gobble it up and DONE.  One cat is 8 lbs and the other about double that. and neither has experienced any negative side effects.  Since Program targets flea eggs. we combine it with the Capstar tablets to address the adult fleas. as well.  It's made a huge difference. and I'm gratified to see the cats relax in comfort rather than constantly scratching and biting."
8,"I purchased this Jumbo drinking fountain to make sure my cats would drink more water.  More water they drink the less I have to worry about with urinary infections.  All my cats love this fountain.  Some drink at the bottom tray and others will drink from the top where the water is just coming out.It keeps the water cool all the time.  My only problem is when my 2 Labs come into the house and when they drink they will devour the whole thing and I have to watch to make sure that the water does not get below motor.So far I have had this fountain for about 6 months and it is very quiet. easy to install and easy to clean.Julie"
1,"We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast.  We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt. but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality.  So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout. so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well.  Overall this has been a great purchase. and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years..."
7,"These do everything the company says.  I was surprised at how easy larger limbs were to cut compared to my old loppers.  My wife tried these and was really pleased at how easy it was to cut limbs.  (Hint. Hint. guys)  Let me say I would not have tried to cut some of the big limbs with my old loppers (now gone to lopper heaven).  If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you.  Only once did I have a problem opening them (handles) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub. it was a big one.  Most of the time I could find an angle to reach through with and cut inside limbs with no problem.  I would recommend these to anyone who like me enjoys easy work.  At 66 years old and surviveing throat cancer surgery I need that too."
2,"I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it. but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight. great heat distribution. NOT aluminium. and sturdy. As a pressure cooker. I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month. I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days. I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version."
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
5,"As soon as I got this pedal I put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum. I have a 2 Behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals.but my pedal board was silent till I put this pedal on it. I've only had it for a few days. but the cons out way the pros. Maybe I will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit. Once I get around to playing with it I will write another review."
2,"We needed a new vacuum and I could not decide on what i really wanted. So far this thing has been pretty sweet for the price. Your are obviously not going to get quiet. super cyclone. bagless. blah blah blah and I was not expecting that. This thing is loud. takes bags and has is not easy to store. But it does the job we needed and that is what counts.I am taking one star off because I really wish there was a place to clip the hose and attachment tubes to the housing for better storage. Other than that. color me impressed."
8,"I've used Nature's Miracle for years on pet stains. and found it to be the best at removing stubborn smells. but I'm always willing to try something new.I tried this Bissell Pre-Treat on some old upholstered chairs my husband purchased at a garage sale for $5. He was going to use them out in his shop so he didn't mind a few stains. but I really minded the old-dog-urine smell!After using the pre-treat as recommended. I proceeded to clean the chairs using my Bissell Spot Bot and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The chairs looked nearly new. only two small stains remained on the light colored material. Unfortunately. the smell was more stubborn. and required a re-wash and application of Nature's Miracle to finally make it disappear for good."
11,"I bought this for one of my sons because he is fascinated by the human body right now. On first glance. this is a very cool product. The book that is included is a fun. nicely illustrated introduction to the various parts and systems of the body.My kids LOVE the squish factor of all the little organs. That is fun. However. they aren't very practical. They are really difficult to get squished back into the guy once you're done. I am not letting them play with it on their own because we are using it as a resource for our science lessons in our homeschool. I think if I let them have free reign over this. it would not last very long. I also wish it had a better way of storing it. because the gummy organs are going to get dusty quickly now that we've opened it up. I will probably end up getting a shoebox-sized plastic tub to keep it in. as the box it comes in isn't going to cut it."
8,"I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't an oily topical that you have to avoid touching for 2 days until fully absorbed.  I know the flea protection works and can only hope that the tick protection works. too.  I like that it's supposed to repel ticks and lice.There is a new one out called NEXGARD that is oral. but I'm reluctant to try it since it currently only lists one tick type and isn't a repellant. so the tick has to bite the dog before it kills it."
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
2,"Can I say more?  Well. this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight. when it's thoroughly frozen. you put it on the base. fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire. put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later. or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also. by the way. it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry."
11,"Bought this for Christmas 2012 for my daughter who was 6 at the time. She absolutely loved making this book.  You have the option of showing the kids handwriting. or having it typed. You pick a book color and its hardcover. It looks really nice and professional. We have bought additional for gifts since then.  I think it's an excellent educational gift to give. and memories can be created that will last as long as you own the book!The great part is that the assembling of the book is included with the kit that you buy here.  It's wonderful!"
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
1,"I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls. cameras.and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down."
1,"This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However. my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed. it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!"
10,"This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above. most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
7,"I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy. doesn't heat up. and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head. you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18' handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said. it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles."
8,"I'm suspicious of the packaging because I've never seen it. and it does not match the picture shown.  The package I received has a different dog on it. and the UPC has been replaced with a sticker with a different UPC on it.  I am returning this because it does not match the packaging at my vet. nor at other pet websites that sell Frontline Plus. approved in the U.S.Update: Surprisingly. Amazon will not allow a return on this item because it's considered hazardous. So with that thought in mind. buyer beware."
6,"While not being familiar with the rest of the market. I am impressed by this product.  It is like the metal book holders which I have used before. the ones that keep the pages open.  But it works with documents.  For a researcher. this is a helpful tool in order to type commentary at the computer while retaining the documents vertically.  Set up is simple.  The only problem is that the string keeping the documents in place sometimes is liable to come loose.  Other than that. I really like it."
12,"Despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System (and get used to it. because that lasts until the PS2 era-- aka. the sixth game in the series) this has to be one of the funnest games of all time. It gives a challenge on multiple levels & inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre. Was re-made as Tomb Raider: Anniversary. but I'd prefer the original any day."
3,"When is there a reason good enough to expand your family.  Dan is in love with his wife. Elle.  They have an amazing relationship. a great sex life. and a comfortable home.  So why would he want a baby?  It would change everything. and possibly not in a good way.  Elle is torn. but only because she doesn&#8217;t know what she wants to do when she grows up. but she is already grown and married.  But how would a baby fit in when she doesn&#8217;t feel that she is where she wants to beIs Dan&#8217;s love and understanding reason enough?  Read the story.  The ending will surprise you. well maybe not.Click here for your copy: Reason Enough"
10,"I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold. feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I've spent on tools. this was the best $150 I ever spent.  I usually spring for more money than I need. but I'm sure glad I didn't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools (not mine). He's getting one as a gift."
11,"I got this for my 7 yr old son to take with us while we traveled for the holidays.  I worried it might be &#34;boring&#34; to him in comparison to his DS. his books and such.  But he played this with me over and over.  I was so grateful for it while we waited 5 extra hours in the airport.  The pieces are attached. which is great for not worrying about losing them. but they are held on very tightly and we had to work hard together to turn them over.  Don't know if they'll loosen up over time."
7,"I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature's expense but - BWAHAHAHA. bite THIS. you bloodsucking fiends!!I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John.  The employees in the cantina each had one. and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces. almost in a hypnotic way.  Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes. according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)  If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away. but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ...!  ;^)Heed what everyone says though: don't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed. and don't let kids 'play' with it.  It can give you a nasty burn."
10,"Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery. doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent. but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
3,"Wow! out of the chute action. romance and one Hot Outlaw named Cal Ryker!***************This is a follow up from RIDING WEST (believe me when I say it means Celia was 'hehehe...riding Parker West!'..not the compas direction..) I suggest ya'all read that one first!Cal is one dreamy Cowboy. with a quick draw and a reputation that sets the other 6 members of the train robbing gang to thinking twice before denying his offer to trade his share of the take for the woman they took hostage. Cal's original plan to just keep Laurel safe until he can return her to her family. goes awry when they find themselves alone for 2 weeks!.......(2 steamy weeks)What starts out as a hasty rescue winds up as more of a heartfelt romantic tale complete with smart. sassy and sexy dialogue as only Emma can conjur. This is one short tale that packs alot of romantic pillow talk and honest character development that will make you 'sigh' and beg Emma for more. more. more of those West/Evans's stories."
11,"My daughter really loves this PEG set. I would give 5 stars if there weren't a couple of problems. The yellow board the pegs fit into is foam. A harder more firm surface would be better! I was disappointed by that. The pegs fit well into each slot and they are stackable but about 3 or 4 of them did not fit into the other pegs for stacking. I contacted amazon and they refunded me $5 for the inconvenience. They did give me the option to return for a new set but I choose to keep it as my daughter really likes playing with it. Despite the fact that the bottom is made of foam. I think it will last for play thru her toddler years (she is 22months old now)."
3,"I bought this book without reading the reviews. Getting on here now. it seems that they all pretty much agreed with me. This was a fantastic story and sucked me right in. Then it just ended. It felt like I read the first third of the book and then found the rest of the pages ripped out.When you are raised as an outcast. what happens when you suddenly find yourself a queen of the people who banished your parents? Then how do you act when you find out that the last few rulers have all been murdered? Well. we don't really know because the story just ended before finishing the plot line!As much as I enjoyed the story. I would recommend waiting to see if there is a second one before reading it. If this story is going to be finished in a second book. I would definitely recommend it though.This was easy to read and the characters grab you. The only downfall was that it leaves you swinging in the breeze at the end."
8,"I had stopped using Frontline a few years ago when it 'appeared' to stop being effective on my dogs. It was on sale a couple months ago so I tried it again. I don't what they did but I'd say it improved as I found no sign of ticks (or fleas) on the pets. We are heavy with them here in Maine in the fall and so far the Frontline is doing what it suppose to. As long as it does that and doesn't have an adverse effect (which can happen) on our pets we'll continue to use it.."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
12,"To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there. the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey. the 3rd person view not help. Plus. Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh. and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen. you sad people!"
2,"I LOVE this spreader - I bought one to try it out. despite some negative reviews.  I thought. it's only $5. I'll try it.I haven't had any of the problems that others have stated.  I don't take it apart for cleaning. and I haven't seen any rust spots.  I just throw mine in the dishwasher.After using spreaders from Pampered Chef. I much prefer the Oxo spreader. as it's much stiffer & able to scoop better.  Very useful for peanut butter. cheese spreads. cream cheese. etc.  I like it so much. I'm ordering more."
2,"As many folks out there. including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers. After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual. as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds. less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat. which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:&#34;Brown Food tastes Good&#34;."
10,"The factory fence sucked bad. I added the Rousseau 2600 fence system and it now a different saw. plenty of power. now very accurate. I use the portable setup in the bed of truck. sitting the saw on the tailgate at least 3 times a week ripping material for jobs. Bought this saw for $151 atHD so even happier at that price. Rousseau was $101 with all the Amazon deals available at the time. $30 off. Gold Box. and A9. Believe it or not I still like my old 2708 better."
6,"By way of disclosure. I received a sample of this product for evaluation purposes.The only guillotine trimmer I ever used with any frequency was my mother's.  It was a heavy unit. made largely of hardwood with a heavy spring-loaded arm.  It was hardly portable -- it weighed a lot.This Swingline trimmer is much lighter. with the surfaces made of plastic.  It's easy to get it out when you have a job that calls for it.It has a sharp blade that cuts paper cleanly without requiring excessive force.  It is reasonably stable on a table.It can deal with sheets of paper bigger than the standard 8.5&#34;x11&#34; size. having a 15&#34; cutting length.  If you need to trim legal paper lengthwise. this trimmer can do it.Overall. it is a fine trimmer and isn't too expensive.  If you only need a trimmer for occasional use. I'd recommend it."
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
5,"Well thought out unit that does what it says it will. drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized. it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer. allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell. even my cats can't do that. and they're porcelain."
5,"I love this pedal. I bought one used at GC the other day for $30 and never looked back. Before it I was using a Joyo Vintage OD that is also an excellent 808 Clone but this pedal is able to tweak the highs and lows better. I have it set so the level is set to 9:00. Low is set to 1:00. High is set to 9:00 and the Gain is set to next tuesday. I prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that. It also is a nice smooth OD not too crunchy.For a cheap 808 clone this is the best I have used hands down.Maxon 808 - $150Ibanez TS9 - $100Digitech Bad Monkey - $60Joyo Vintage OD - $50All great pedals for the money but not really sold that the Maxon is 2 1/2 times better."
6,"Easy to assemble!!  Sturdy!!  Works very well.  I thought the clear plastic was a good idea.. With it. you don't really need to remove the item to see your Computer screen.  It seems to be of very good quality.  I didn't give it another star 'cause I wished it would have been a bit easier to remove when needed.  It kind of 'bends in the middle' when moving it.  But. all in all a handy item to have around."
1,"I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging. and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer. re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so. and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation."
6,"You buy a nice gift and you want to wrap it for that special person to whom you are going to give it.  You found the perfect gift wrap paper. cut the paper perfectly and fold every crease to perfection.  Now use the best tape there is to seal the deal!Scotch Giftwrap Tape has a unique satin finish that helps the tape disappear on the wrapping paper.  It seals tightly and it is easy to dispense and cut.  It doesn't yellow or show air bubbles and provides the finishing touch on the package.  Tape that doesn't show up so much that it steals the beauty of your wrapping job.Don't forget the ribbon!"
5,"Best articulate bass string for the money.  I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s.  I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued.  They sound great and stay in tune.  Sound like Rotosounds.....think Roger Glover. Geddy Lee. and Chris Squier.  Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick.  I am not a slap style player so I can't comment on that.  I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible. Try them. you'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy."
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
12,"This game is fairly short and can be beaten in a matter of ten minutes on the easy route. but it does provide other secrets and ways to go about the game.  You can go through three main paths. but you can quirk the paths if you decide to or if you screw up on one part of the level.  You definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score.  The rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title.  The voices are also a nice added feature.  Buy this game guys."
12,"The battle system could of been a lot better.  Number one: There's too many battles in the first place.  You take three steps you get in a battle.  You walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle.  You take one step. most likely you'll get in a battle.  Also. let me point out that once you're in a battle. you can't move around.  And plus summoning whatever it is you're trying to summon. like Thunder or something. you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once.  It's hard to do.  However. I think that the game was engaging and never let ya go.  It was entertaining. and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucks$...but...the battle system could of been a lot better. I'm sorry."
8,"I don't know what it is about the Galileo. but my American Bulldogs looooove it. They will actually fight over it. I don't know whether its the shape or flavor or what. I usually get them Nylabones dura chews (as they are strong chewers) and this holds up about as well (though it is hard to gauge as they really chew this one so much more). The biggest size is much larger than the second largest size. so despite the big price jump I still think its worth it."
10,"I've been using this sander since 1976.  Back then. it was made by Rockwell.  Porter Cable bought out their tool division several years ago.  They know a timeless design when they see one and this sander needed no improvement.  This is a heavy. heavy duty orbital sander.  It uses its own weight to do the job.  Using half sheets of sand paper. it cheaper to operate over the long run over having to buy round sheets that come 4 or 6 to a pack and can be pricey.Since I've owned this unit. I've only had to replace the power cord. thats it. and it was in a production shop environment for 3 years.  I have used it in place of a belt sander at times. with an aggressive grit paper. its that good.  Highly recommended for the serious wood worker."
10,"All the settings right out of the box are spot on. No adjustments were necessary. The dust bag collected all the shavings and none were left on the ground. I was really surprised as most dust bags are virtually useless. This is a fine addition to my DeWalt tool library. The price on Amazon was less than the B&M stores and delivery was overnite with 'prime'. Always a good experience with Amazon and thats why Amazon always gets first crack at my purchases. As far as the dust bag goes. make sure you empty it frequently and Im sure you will be more than satisfied with it. Made in Mexico. not China."
2,"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.  3 were from the manual that came with the machine. and one was from the internet.  All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.  The ice cream was not creamy and melty. it was either icy or fudgy.  I like the machine. it is easy to use. but also quite loud.  We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.  I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well.  The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream. but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it."
10,"I recently purchased the Dewalt DW318 SCMS and ordered this clamp at the same time. I was disappointed when I compared the clamp that came with the saw with this one. The stock clamp has a smaller knob on the top for tightening against the work piece. and only the DW7082 has the quick release button to quickly raise or lower it. The stock clamp does have a bolt on the back of the arm that can lower it on the leg. but the fence of the saw only allows 1/4' of play unless it's slid out of the way. Originally I only ordered one DW7082 clamp knowing that the saw would already come with a clamp. but after comparing the two side by side. I ordered a second DW7082 and put the stock clamp aside. To invest in the saw and not have accessories that perform the way I want them doesn't make sense to me."
12,"i loved the first and second tomb raider's and this one is just amazing. i love the story. the graphics are good. the gameplay is really easy. and it's relatively easy. i know that many people say that this game is way too hard. but there seriously mistaken. it's really not that hard. it's much like the other tomb raiders. i still play it. it's such a good game.get this if you liked the other tomb raider games. and pay no attention to the reviews that give this game 1.2 or even 3 stars! just stick to that 4's and the 5's.oh. one more little thing... if you have vista or a laptop you may have some sound effect problems. but it usually fixes itself after you play it for a few hours."
1,"I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared. leaving just the medicine in place. I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus doesn't get immune to it. As you might know. there is NO cure for nail fungus. not even by prescription. you can only control it.  This product here is an oil. think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc. Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied. This product is no good."
3,"I have read several Shannon Stacey books and the Devlin Group series is by far my favorites!  This book is the 1ST of the 3 book series (in order:  72 hours. On the Edge. No Surrender).  I never read books twice. but I will definitely be revisiting this series and I saw on the authors website that a 4th one is in the works!  I can't say enough about this series and can definitely not pick a favorite!  I have read some other reviews on this 1st book and can't say I agree with the 3 and 4 star ratings. but for those of you who would be willing to read more. finish the series before you write a complete review."
11,"TTR is pretty much my goto game for any group of folks 'new' to modern adult board games:-very simple gameplay - draw some cards. play some matching cards. put trains on the board. lather rinse repeat-rules can be taught to even attention-deficited folk in a matter of minutes. No long boring recitation of rules. Just unpack start playing and explain while executing first turn(s).-while simple to play/teach. there is enough strategy in the game to keep more experienced players 'in' the game-short play time and quick turns prevents new players from becoming bored and losing interest. Also permits firing up an immediate second game if the first go is a hit."
11,"Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended."
10,"I purchased this dado a few weeks ago and I would purchase it again. It comes with 2 blades. 3 chippers. spacers and shims. It's really easy to setup for the thickness you want even if you need the spacers or shims. The more common widths typically use just the blades and chippers and are really fast on setup. For example. one blade will give you 3/16 and 2 blades for 1/4. 2 blades and 1 chipper for 3/8. I've only had to use shims once on an odd ball width I needed. I have noticed some minor splintering on some edge cuts on pine. and I made a 3/8' dado that was 1/64 short. but you should always do a test cut first anyway (at least one test cut for a new width) and then you could just add a shim. I think this Dado is definitely worth the price. I'm pretty happy with it."
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
10,"This is my second purchase of the Hitachi Saw. now for my son. who started using mine over 15 years ago when he was in high school.  The saw is the most precise miter saw I have used (I once bought a cheaper saw for off-site work and discarded it as unsatisfactory). much less bulky than a 12 inch saw.  has more cut capacity than the larger blade models and has smoother travel along its double rails than comparable sliding saws.  Yes. it looks expensive. but. after 15 years.  I'm glad I stretched my saw budget a bit to get a good one.  Naturally. since my son learned on the Hitachi saw.  a dad can't gift him an inferior grade."
10,"This is a great saw. and they've improved the dust collection -- my only complaint with an older model.  Buying it from Amazon/toolcrib. however. is a nuisance.  Trying to get presales support was useless. with conflicting information or tech people just reading me things from the web site.  More importantly. the delivery time they gave me was a window of more than two weeks. and it took nearly 3 weeks to get the thing.  AND. it arrived BROKEN.  Fortunately. Dewalt is sending me a new one. but clearly someone had dropped this saw along the way since the lockdown pin was bent and the handle housing was broken.  I bought from amazon only because they had a (...) when I bought the saw. but the price they quoted changed from day to day on the web site."
5,"I like thin picks myself. and this one is VERY thin. You won'tuse it all the time. but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off. it is ideal. Also. if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar. it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy. but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and it's grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most. it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!"
3,"Another great read in this series. I absolutely loved the first one and had to have the second and I was not disappointed. If anything it had only hooked me on this series even more. I love the characters and how everything interacts and flows together. It's written really well and I'm able to just immerse myself in the story and the world that has been created and I don't want to leave. even when the book is done. There is plenty of action in this story to keep your attention.  Now to get the next one :)."
12,"I am a major player of 007 games. I have played nearly every single one. but I have to say. GoldenEye is one of the best that there is. even years and platforms later. Even though I have a GameCube with all of the other 007 games. I still to this day find myself returning to play a round of Goldeneye.GoldenEye has a great plotline (in my opinion. even better than the movie) and long missions. which allow a lot of replay value. The graphics are a bit blurry. but that is to be expected in an N64 FPS.Overall. I love this game. and would reccomend it to any 007 fan."
11,"Last Night on Earth: Growing Hunger is an expansion for the Last Night on Earth game. I love it because it is so much fun! My friends and I get together once a month for game night and this is one we always pull out. This expansion add heroes. props. locations and scenarios to the main game. You do need the main Last Night on Earth board game for this add on to help you in any way. If you would like to know more about the main game there is a video on you tube from Wil Wheaton on his tabletop gaming blog style show called &#34;TableTop&#34; they played last night on earth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhLU2-BuhMIIts a great explanation of the game and how it works! However I took it to the next level and I hand painted my hero figures. I will post the images."
1,"My nails and cuticles have been so dry and were looking just awful!  Some peeling of nails. but don't think it was fungus~just cold winter and using bleach to clean while at my daughter's house with no gloves.  Ran across a bottle of this stuff while looking for nail polish. remembered how it had cleared up a toe fungus years ago. and decided to try it on my nails. just to see if it would help.  WOWOWOWOWOW! You wouldn't believe the change in my cuticles and nails in the last 3 days!  Whatever is in this stuff is just really great for dry. peeling nails. with or without fungus. dry cuticles. and who knows what else! I may try it on other skin issues now.  GREAT stuff!"
10,"I absolutely love this jigsaw. so much that I actually try to come up with projects requiring its use. Plenty of power. rock solid cutting. easy-enough blade changes. and with the Progressor blades. amazing cutting speed with great smoothness. I was. like many people moving up to this kind of tool. replacing a older Ryobi-Craftsman -- one that I thought was pretty decent -- but there's just no comparison. The Craftsman got sold at a yard sale for $4. The newer Bosch 1590 model has gotten some wishy-washy reviews. so I went with the proven performer and I don't regret it a bit."
6,"We buy a lot of paper each year.  Mead provides a good basic (cheap) paper that will no doubt meet the needs of most students. However. I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day. It's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option but for wide-ruled paper (for younger students) I think it really shouldn't be quite so thin.Pricing Note (not part of the review):The price as I write this review is $1.33 for 200 sheets of wide-ruled filler paper. That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping. If the price is higher as you read this review you may want to consider coming back at the start of the next school season and stocking when they are on sale."
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
11,"This ship is an excellent support ship to have flying alongside the falcon or y-wings. Just don't expect a attack ship. It is a very limited ship without the upgrades.cons: the pins that come with the ships are a little flimsy and are prone to cracking. Fantasy flight needs to put out a replacement pack. With this ship in particular the pin glued to the inside of the ship snapped on the 2nd time we were setting up to play. I will need to glue it back together but I wish they were a little stronger than that."
8,"This is the only 'hard' synthetic chewy my dog is really interested in. It is slightly pliable rubbery material - but he's had others with a similar feel that he wouldn't chew as long as this. Not sure if it's the nubby texture? I bought this size hoping he could hold in his paws. but it's still a little short (he's a 20 pound dog). We end up holding one end while he chews - with his eyes closed and an expression of pure joy. He works pretty hard at it for 10 minutes or so."
5,"Arrived on time ... works as intended and maybe more.One day. I was pondering how best to de-clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various 9V-12V DC equipment on my table or rack. Fortunately. I chanced upon this little gem and in an instant ... my problem was solved. I chose the 12V adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary 12V DC source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack. I also bought another similar unit form another source here on Amazon and used that to supply the 9V DC source to power the rest of the units that needed a 9V source. Everything worked fine and I relegated the remaining adapters to storage. Been working without a problem to this day."
3,"I wrote a 'downer' of a review yesterday...then realized that I hadn't read the entire book! Silly me...This is a very good 'cookbook' with clear directions and quite a bit of good help that isn't in the basic Kindle User's Guide. I know I'll have more fun with this new best friend of mine after I finish the cookbook and start trying all the things listed that one can do. Just the thought of being able to access my Gmail while going down the road in our RV makes my mouth water. Add to that the ease of reading with larger type...well. this Western Reader is one happy gal. Thanks. David. for all your hard work!"
6,"Avery have literally set the standard for pre-cut adhesive peel-off labels and these are no different. Easy to remove from the backing (much easier than some other brands) and high quality paper and strong backing glue make these labels perfect for your label needs. I printed a bunch with a photo background and they look almost as good as a glossy print. Plus Avery always offers templates for the most used software packages (outlook. excel etc) so printing alignment and pre-filled info is handled for you so no need to perform multiple test prints before doing a proper print.It may seem like a simple thing to print onto labels but anyone who has used generic labels which don't conform to any standard will know just how many you can waste before everything is lined up. With Avery's labels the hard work is done for you and your labels will look perfect first time."
11,"I can totally see why this game was endorsed by Mensa. I bought this for my 5-year old's birthday and we just opened the box. The pieces are very nicely made. and feel high quality. It took some time teaching my son how to play the game. but he eventually picked up the basics. While it is a simple concept. there are definitely strategies that can be enacted to make this game more complicated and technical than it looks. For this reason. I believe that it would be enjoyable for a range of ages. from 5 to 100+."
7,"I love this little blower!  I can grab it at a moment's notice and blow the leaves. pine needles. and other debris out of my courtyard.  SOOO much easier than dragging out the corded electric blower for quick light jobs!  Fits my 'girl hands' nicely. not too heavy. not too noisy. lasts about 15 minutes.  For the big jobs. I'll still get out the 'monster' electric blower that works like a hurricane coming through. but with this little guy I find myself blowing leaves and stuff frequently now. instead of dreading getting out the big one for a small job.  I'm going to look at the other items they make that uses the same battery pack too."
11,"You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful. in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen. and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.Every Rebel Squadron should have a Y-Wing. they are great support craft.  I won a pre-release Millennium Falcon with 2 X-Wings and a Y-Wing.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets. so that you get double dice. spare templates. extra cards. and 6 ships to start out with."
11,"'A Creativity Tool for Innovators' is great marketingspeak. but it's a lie.After making a few patterns over the course of a few days. you and your kids will grow bored by this thing. It's more like a toy you'd buy on a lark at a dollar store; 'It looks fun. and it's only a buck.'At this price range. I expect some longevity or some real true fun. and this thing provides neither.***EDIT (three years later)*** -- my two year old boy  is now turning five. and he can't get enough of this thing. mostly because it's a BALL THAT 'EXPLODES' when you throw it or drop it."
1,"i can't say this stuff work wonders.but I can't say that it doesn't help. Consistency is the key to all work outs and lower calorie intake. There those who truly believe in this product So don't take my review to heart. It could work for you better then other people everyone is different and since we all have different metabolism and health system it will work wonders for some and for some it won't. this is a case of try for yourself and see if it works for you.  Since individual result may (will) vary."
1,"I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers. I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff. I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks. tile. shower. and linoleum. It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics. It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand. this is it."
6,"I bought this paper after purchasing an Epson Aritsan 730 printer. only to see it not show very good print quality on generic printer paper.  I had tested the Epson Photo paper. and found it to be superior in quality to the HP premium paper that I had used for Photos. so I figured perhaps I needed to go with better paper for my basic printing as well.  Made a huge difference.  Text looks wonderful on it.  Paper is a nice thickness and doesn't feel as flimsy as most generic papers.  It should...afterall. it's roughly double the price of bargain paper.  But when you're looking to print something and have it look nice. better to go with good quality paper"
2,"I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another.  The first one broke after using it a three or four times. but since I like Oxo products in general. I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out. it uses tiny. metal teeth to grip the lid. which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless. so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a  spoon.  Works better than Oxo. that's for sure."
3,"So I actually started The Darkest Night first then realized this one was first so had to pause DN to read this one :PI liked this short. first look into the series. Kadence and Geryon were a heartbreaking but sweet tale. Although this story was very short and at times it seemed a little rushed. I loved the emotion behind this couples need for each other.The fact that they could forge that connection while in hell made it that much more potent.I never thought I'd like a half-beast man...oh. who am I kidding? I want aliens. vampires. Lykae. Gods and Demons at this point. Half-beasts actually seem tamed compared to that :pNow that I have the back story. I'm dying to go and finish Maddox. He was KILLING me. Ungh Violence. I'm coming back for ya baby!"
7,"This does exactly as advertised. The Black Russian Truffle Tomato i put in mine was growing famously. Actually. it's growth was fairly unprecedented. until....the whole thing fell and the plant's main stem was crushed. See. when the planter is watered properly. it is also incredibly heavy for its size. So. the lesson there would be to make sure whatever you hang it from can hold quite a bit of weight. I would say it needs to be able to hold at least twenty pounds. since the total weight of a fully grown plant with the planter and all the requisite soil and watering will at least end up weighing this much. It might be safer to shoot for 30 pounds though. However. that was a user error problem on my part for not planning properly. The planter itself is great. You cant overwater. as any excess will simply run out the bottom. A good solid and inexpensive purchase."
10,"Plan to spend an extended amount of time tuning this plane and sharpening the blade. I am operating on a very limited budget so I had to go with the cheaper route for my planes. I'll have the plane set up nicely when I'm finished with it. but it is a significant amount of work out of the box. The sole wasn't flat. the mouth wasn't square. the bed wasn't flat. the blade.... basically a butter knife. and it did take a good few hours to make it a decent tool. For a plane of this size. it wasn't a huge effort. but it is an effort and it is time spent tuning rather than time spent working wood.If you can afford it. get the rabbiting block plane from a highly reputable name instead. If not. go ahead and get this one but don't cry when it takes you hours to get it into good shape."
12,"I read alots of review about this game.alot of people said that Ape Escape was good.so I decided to buy Ape Escape for myself.Geez they were right.this game is great and fun.This is a fun game I mean I have to catch those monkey on different level and sometime each land have 4 or 6 or over 10 that each of the land that the monkey stay.There about 8 weapon/gaget that I can use to kill the enamy and to help me out on some hard place to reach.This game have 25 level and 200 monkey to catch.this game can be play for everyone.&quot;like the esrb rated said on the front&quot;.Ape Escape is mild animated violence.there no gore or bad word on it &quot;just wanted the parents to know it&quot;.I never get tired of playing Ape Escape.this is a really fun to catch the monkey.Get this game you won't be dissappointed.I haven't too!"
8,"Historically. my family has had great success with frontline. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because I know it can work (based on the flea population characteristics your dog comes in contact with).We had been using this for 2 months when my dog went to a friends house while we were on vacation. When we got back. he had fleas galore. We put on the next frontline a week early and it did not even phase the fleas on him.We switched to K9 advantix II and the fleas were gone within a couple of days. I know that some fleas are now resistant to Frontline. and that certainly seemed to be the case for the fleas on my dog. I would recommend not buying any more than a 3 month supply at a time in case your dog gets fleas like mine that aren't phased by frontline. If you try Frontline and it doesn't work. k9 advantix II might. as it did for me."
1,"man! i wish i knew about this when i was younger! I never knew that there were pills about this to help with lactose intolerance... do you guys know how much i suffered bc of milk when i was young? all that diarrhea? it sucked! One day I was like hmmm what if there are pills we can take for lactose intolerance? And there was! I was eager to try it. I'm partly lactose intolerant and It's not that severe. I only get diarrhea when I eat a lot of dairy but ti's not too bad. I take this whenever I drink milk and it does work. I don't get diarrhea like I use to. Now of course this might not work for you bc everyones body response differently to pills."
2,"My wife is from Brazil. so she is a foremost authority on pressure cookers as they use them there for almost every meal daily.Originally I tried the very cheap aluminum alternative for $15 on sale at Sears. and it failed after one use.This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient. it's durable. it's just plain a good product. and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item."
2,"I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.  It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.  The only thing you have to remember is to keep the freezer inserts in the freezer and that the ice cream will be soft when finished churning.  I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.  I wasn't all that happy with the recipes I found in the booklet (didn't want to use heavy cream or cook the base) but there are skazillions of recipes on line and after some trial and error I made up my own.  I saw some people complained of the noise. but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.  Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.  [...]  I am very happy with this purchase."
2,"The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they're spread out.  That's ok IF you use this brush to remove food from utensils prior to placing in dishwasher.If you're trying to clean pans though. this brush won't be perfect.  In that case. consider a brush just meant for that purpose such as this one:Cuisinart Round Head Brush.  Black.I recently discovered the advantage of using both kinds of brushes depending on what I'm doing.  This way. the kitchen brush isn't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items.  The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one. but I found it better this way."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
12,"Mega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man.  The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures.  Game play is fun and easy to learn.  The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value.  easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you'll only spend oh...one week or so one it.  Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages!!!"
10,"Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do. it collapses easily and always returns to the same position."
7,"Really. this is a very effective means of pest control. The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it. and having them displaces so you dont accidentally turn it on is nice. When you strike. you get a big blue jolt. which from my experience. makes it fun for the kiddos. Also. i touched the racket while it was on....the current is definitely pretty strong. It wont kill a person. but it does hurt. which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much. much smaller insects. They dont always die first zap. but it always stuns them at the least. allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $10 IMO."
3,"I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have passed over this book. It just did not look that interesting and it seemed like this was the one and only book written by Samantha Cruise so it cannot be that good. can it?Boy was I ever wrong! This is the most eroctic. most sensual. most passionate. most sexiest. hottest. steamiest. most graphic book I have ever read. Did I say hot. did I say sexy. did I say extremely eroctic. then let me repeat myself again! I am not sure if Samantha Cruise has written any other books and to date I have not been able to find any but I hope she writes more books. This book was so hot that made I left my husband a very happy man! I would highly recommend this book! Great Job Ms. Cruise!"
2,"Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker. It's so easy and the results are amazing. I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream. It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find. Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream. I've made mint chip. premium vanilla bean and strawberry. I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream). Sorry. Haagen-Dazs. I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!"
11,"Why do all the best board games originate from Europe?I read about this game on an on-line game site. highlighting some of the best family board games out there. and this is one that made the list. It looked fun and easy-to-learn. so I picked it up in time for the holidays. I had a lot of fun playing this with my family over Thanksgiving and Christmas get-togethers. The game is simple to learn. simple to play. and is really pretty casual. There's a small amount of luck and strategy involved. but most people can play this on an even footing and it is not geared towards competitive game-play. More fun with the full five players on the board. it can still be finished in about 1 hour of play. I highly recommend trying this game out!"
7,"This past summer I tried a charcoal grill for the first time and as a result my gas grill was never taken out of the garage.  It's become an obsession of mine and now I have three different grills. one smoker and a collection of different wood chunks.  My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy. foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes.  I don't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time.  Two sheets of newspaper. dump in your fuel of choice and light it.  10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go.  If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead.  If you grill on a deck be careful when you light it or where you put it after dumping out the coals as it gets very hot."
7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
12,"Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).Some championship races and cars can only be 'unlocked' by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally. and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it. be sure to rate it as helpful."
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
10,"It sure is nice having a flash light that I always know there is a fresh battery in.  This is the case because I have multiple of the 12-volt DeWalt batteries and always keep one on the unplugged charger fully charged and ready to swap out for a dead battery. This flashlight is well balanced and feels nice in the hand and turns on and off easily with the thumb of the hand holding the light.  My only complaint is that it eats the battery up pretty fast. I am unable to make a run to the outhouse and back without the flashlight going dead (or at least very dim).  And I don't stay seated long.  I end up turning it off while seated."
6,"This can come in handy for different home projects and decorating. For example. I decorated a huge bathroom mirror with small framed pictures using this double sided tape. it looked great. Perfect when you can't or don't want to ruin a wall with a nail.  I also decorated the ceramic tile backsplash in the kitchen with the same sort of small framed pictures.  The tape is not too hard to remove from the glass/mirror/tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls.  A little sanding of the residue is needed."
7,"Pricey? Yes. but well worth it!!  I have purchased many bird feeders over the years (including Duncraft) but this feeder is the Rolls Royce in design. construction. durability and ease of use (filling. hanging).  Squirrels have eaten the last of my birdseed - this one will definitely keep them out - so ingenious!  I also purchased the weatherguard to protect the birds. as well as the seed. from the elements. I am sooooo impressed with this feeder - I hope the birds like it as much as I do!  (ha-ha)The weatherguard was a little tricky to install but if I can do it. anyone can!  Just follow the instructions that come with it."
8,"I guess I'm in the minority.  I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this.  Good chewing BUT.....they made my dog sick and he barfed five times.  And guess what came up?  And. yes. the sharp little edges were still there.  No more nylabone products for me. I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning.  mb"
6,"I do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price/design ratio.  The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it.  The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair. with two plastic attachments to it. For this price a few extras should have been included. I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply cannot handle the weight.Overall. it works ok. but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect."
2,"This is my second Eureka.  The first a Eureka  100 - a BIG Floor standing Model.  This died on me after fifteen years.  Was too big and heavy.The Mighty Mite was ordered and delivered within one week.Tried it out the same day - This machine S U C K S !! (I mean the DUST)The lightweight is very handy.  Did my 3 Bedroon unit with upstairs and stairs without much effort.  The extra brushes. and long handle and tubes are very good for window sills and odd corners.  Does hard floors well.The free shippind was a great help.  With a little addition to qualify for FREE SHIPPING - I got the Bissell Featherweight Bagless. which I ordered together for areally great deal.A very good buy through Amazon.  Very Happy with machine. Thanks Amazon for assisting  in the Free Shipping."
11,"My nephew-in-law got engaged  and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good. but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts. She brings it over every time she comes. My husband and I  have played this for years. It is one of the  very few games that  is good for 2 people. You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck. If you are looking for a good game for 2 people. this is it. Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time. You can earn bonus points if youare lucky. What more could  you ask?"
3,"Author Steve Peek will have me sleeping with the lights on for a while. I thought I was over being afraid of the dark. but not after reading this book... Why do I need the lights on?Answer: Longclaws...Steve Peek's writing style is masterful. unique. Just take a peek between the covers... He has written a story that addresses the human condition. our capacity to deal with the unimaginable. and find a way to carry on. I totally enjoyed everything about this book: the plot. the characters. the style. the pace. its unpredictability. and above all. even my coming nightmares when I turn out the lights! I highly recommend this book.Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofStory Tellers: In Pursuit of Happiness"
3,"I wouldn't say that Crystal Jordan's 'Treasured' is a spanking novel.  I would say that this book is an erotic novel containing a lot of sex with a spanking or two thrown in for good measure.  That said I still really enjoyed this book.  The focus may not have been on spanking. but it was still a hot read.Becca was the perfect protagonist.  She was strong. independent. and could sword fight better than a man.  But when she and James were together. she was completely submissive.  Her loyalty to James was both sexy and endearing.If you are looking for a steamy novel to read. this one is perfect for you.  It is well written and keeps the reader engaged.  I only wish it had a few more spankings amidst all the spicy sex.Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview"
7,"I like the 10' size.  It holds a substantial pot. whether you change the plant three times a year. or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty. it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet. or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years."
7,"We had a woodchuck last year. a big woodchuck. that decided to set up camp in our backyard.  She(I believe it is a she) ate everything she could get to. nothing was safe.  Thankfully the vegetable garden had a fence but we lost half of our unfenced flower garden.  As soon as things started sprouting this year I started spraying but not what I thought was excessive.  We have not seen our big friend in our garden this year but I did see her in a neighbors yard the other day so I'm hoping it was the Havahart Deer Off and not that she moved to a better neighborhood.We don't have a problem with rabbits or deer and the only issue we have with squirrels is they like to bury nuts in our garden and flower boxes in the fall. so we will see how it goes with them later in the year. The sprayer works well and I'm really interested to see how long the pump lasts and will update as to that also. Recommended."
1,"We buy these for my 89-year-old mother.  It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she cannot get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides. the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours. why go anywhere else?)Anyway. these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent."
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
6,"This is nice thick card stock that does not bleed through. I used these for invitations and printed a full color picture on front. black & white print with a color image inside and a color image on the back. They looked fantastic! Of course I did need to keep the pages separated for a minute. so the ink could dry. but nothing smeared and they looked fabulous. The only trouble I had was that I couldn't find an option for this Avery size in my Word 7. so I used what I thought was closest to that size and it worked just fine (and that is why I didn't give it 5 stars). I would definitely purchase these again!"
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
7,"Purchased this item at 11 AM.  Used free supersaver shipping. Received the next day. Unreal.  Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses. I live in a small Ohio city. The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception. This was a first. The product itself is nice. Well made.  Easy to use.  Some commented on the shipping carton.  It was a long box. with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage. The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top. This will be a useful product. Added:  Minor dissapointment.  Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price. This is a full price store-not a discounter."
5,"I like them. but these strings are probably not for everyone. The EXP16s do provide a crisp. bright sound almost leaning towards metallic. This tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow-bodied Ovation. However. I have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different.While I was not expecting it. my favorite aspect of the EXP16s is the playability. The play is a little more elastic than I thought it would be. and they are amazingly easy on the fingers.The only downside that I experienced with the EXP16s is the fact that. while giving once on the guitar. they are a little brittle off the guitar (I almost snapped my E getting it set up). Other than that. the strings are just a little squeaky. I personally like a little squeak. but at the current price point. I don't think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don't."
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
11,"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests. intrigue. and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords. the new game play is fun!"
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
12,"Whatever happened to the days when games were made to be fun?  Whatever happened to the days where replay value was through the roof and graphics were not as heavily emphasized? This game is well over 10 years old now and it is still fun to play.  Even in this day and age I see kids enjoying it.  This should be one of those games that developers look back upon and say what made that game so much fun?  What can we learn from this aside from improving upon the old school 3D graphics?  Spyro may not be the best game of all time but it certainly is a fun one for me that I have had a lot of fond memories playing."
7,"Received this Toro for Father's Day and I love it. Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores. and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools. Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem. I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model (they are interchangeable). for an additional $30. I was going to mount it right away. but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears. then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this. as the magnesium impeller is very light. yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra. which helps at the end of the day."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
11,"Our 3 year old loves animals and fell in love with this puzzle at first sight.  After a little coaching from us. she is now able to work on putting it together all by herself.We enjoy doing puzzles at our house.  They are a great educational tool and can be a nice quiet time activity.  I often get this out to keep her occupied while I'm cooking dinner.  It has been fun to talk about all the animal names and remember our own trips to the zoo.The packaging and pieces are both good quality.  This puzzle contains 25 pieces and forms 22x22 square.  The puzzle itself is very colorful.  There are a lot of fun. interesting things to see in it.  This would make a delightful gift for any young animal lover."
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
10,"I've used this joiner on various projects over the last couple years. finding it functional and easy to use. but when I recently put it through some considerable work I was seriously impressed. I just made around 400 slots in order to build a half dozen chopping boards. It cut through both jatoba (Brazilian cherrywood) and maple like butter. making clean. consistent. and accurate slots. The blade is very high quality. The dual rack-and-pinion fence is very accurate. easily adjustable. and stays where you set it cut after cut. The gauge is easy to read. a plus when your protective eyewear is covered in sawdust. The preset stops make it easy to choose the proper slot size too."
12,"This is where the epic Resident Evil series began. The first adventure see's you tackle zombies. snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion. which is very atmospheric. Don't be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes. bear in mind that this was made in 1995/1996 and so for the times it's pretty good. This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series' of games on the Playstation. The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star game is the slighty disapointing ending. But this is only a minor flaw. and this is still one of the best games on the Playstation."
1,"This product changed my bladder problems from bad to better. but I still have flow problems.The main thing is that a full 6 tablets caused me to have spells of disorientation. I take no drugs. so it wasn't a compatibility issue. I now take 1 in the morning and two at bedtime with no ill effects. The full dose of 2 three times daily caused me problems.I am 68 and a major cancer survivor. but I don't think that affected it.UPDATE: 3/26/2013Working well now. I have chronic bladder problems. but I take 2 tablets in the morning. 1 in the afternoon. and 2 at night. I think I've adjusted to it now. Still have some flow issues. but the bladder discomfort is long gone. I recommend it! Better than Rx drugs.TaosGuy"
2,"In my humble opinion. most of blenders are not great.  The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit. I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.  So if you are doing a lot of entertaining. you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also. you should look at the recipe book.  The recipe book gives you hints on how to 'layer' the ingredients.I made some awesome hummus by following their directions.As I said earlier. if you are doing heavy blending work with ice you may need a professional unit.  I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill."
10,"I purchased the Dewalt because their tools are historically of good quality. This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper (my little mouse sander does better job) and as for other features. I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect. But my variable speed option still works though.  After using it on a project for about 20 hours. the bearings went and I had to get it fixed.  Once this sander quits on me. I think I'll opt for the Porter Cable."
5,"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills. tough as nails. and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals. this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail. or get up close for some bass response. or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic. 25-ft cable. cable tie. carry pouch. and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra."
2,"My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker. but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it. I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago. and I am super happy with it!!  I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker. and I was able to serve dinner in an hour.  It's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe. and yes. it is safe!"
3,"I read this and felt the tears coming. How moving. I'm not certain if it was just me being overly emotional. but this book lead me to tear up and weep along with the stories.I've always imagined that I would be reached by loved ones and that they would send me the message that is necessary for my moment - a moment of encouragement. What a true blessing (and I don't use that b word much) for those to have received such a gift. Reading about it gives clarity. insight. and hope. so I can imagine that those who are actually touched by these events must be clearer about life and living."
8,"I saw fleas after having been using an oral medication for my dogs--it seemed to have STOPPED working..threw the kids in the tub...bathed them - then RAN to PetsMart and bought the Advantage....in less than 24 hours my dogs STOPPED scratching and slept the night.  I have ordered their next doses from Amazon...but at the first sign of the fleas I wanted IMMEDIATE action..LOLand per another reviewer I did in fact notice a whiff of 'altered' breath on one of my (small) dogs---but it was't awful--but definitely 'changed'"
1,"I suffer from year round allergies with nasal congestion constantly. This saline mist is the best I have tried. It is not drying like the others. The spray bottle is easy to use and gives off a nice mist spray. not alot of fluid just to run back out your nose. I have purchased other spray bottles that were so hateful to use such as the spray hole too small. or the bottle loses it's shape making it hard to squeeze. etc. This mist does the job I need it to to moisten and help clear my nose..sorry gross. Great price here at Amazon also. I'll be buying it again."
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
8,"My Rottie has food allergies to poultry. beef and dairy. I've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that doesn't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste. This toothpaste is peanut flavor (smells like black licorice). He loves the taste and doesn't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night. The price is ok. but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size. Soooo. if your pup has allergies or doesn't like his/her current toothpaste you might want to try this one."
10,"This is one of my all time favorite power tools. It's easy to load and it's super smooth to operate. I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again."
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
12,"This is my all time favorite wrestling game ever made I really enjoy this game alot the modes you have are exhibition tag team special matches like 2 on 1 you have also a 40 player battle royal which to me is my all time favorite feature in this game what so ever winning the titles in this game is alot of fun and to me this game is alot better than the overrated smackdown here comes the pain and it is alot easier than that game as well I don't get why people say smackdown here comes the pain is so great when in reality it sucks because the ai in season mode is very cheap and I hate ai like that but in this game on easy mode the ai is way to easy but to me this game is just awesome and I still play this game alot to this day I never get tired of it."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
12,"Unfortunately this game is just a hodge-podge of elements from the other games.  There are some interesting new units. and I did enjoy the much larger maps.  My biggest complaint is that it is so short.  You are just getting to use some of the more advanced units and the game is over.  You never get the big final battle like at the end of the last two incarnations.  This is by far the shortest game of the bunch.  I finished each side's campaign over the course of three nights. about 9-12 hours of game play."
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
6,"1.  For baseline. I have used an Epson 1280 for the past two years.2.  The only reason to get this printer is if one wants longer life prints.  The print quality / image is MORE difficult to achieve with this printer--not impossible. but more difficult.  Overall. the paper profiles are fairly good (epson papers)--the colors are fairly accurate.  However. the prints are definitely &quot;flatter&quot; (ie less contrast. less saturation) compared to the 1280--this can be worked around to a large extent by simply increasing contrast (esp the black point) and saturation...around by 10 points.3.  Overall. I like the 1280 prints better to a slight degree. but if viewed by itself without a comparison print. the prints from the 2200 are good.  Furthermore. with the increase in print life. overall it's a decent compromise for me.  One has to evaluate their own priorities to see if it would be worth it for them."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
7,"I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!"
10,"This a fine quality machine. It really is very basic and quite simple in its design. Although not as refined as some sanders out there this unit does one thing well. SAND.The ability to adjust the speed is a must on any sander.This tool will easily withstand the daily rigors of loading and unloading your work truck.I do recommend upgrading the sanding shoe and I wish porter cable offered that as a standard.From the rugged american craftsmanship to its simplicity and fair price this tool is a big hit.Two thumbs up on this one.Now get out there and sand something."
12,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character. (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
12,"All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move. Fox McCloud can shoot his laser. Link can throw boomerangs and bombs. while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick. but they all throw. smash. pound. pummle. blast and burn diffrently. Also. items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs. (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords. hammers. Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option. this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game. you'll fall in love with it fast."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
2,"It's does not vac at all.  I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica. they worked great.  Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well.  My only good vac was the upright that's cordless.  It does not clean very well. but does the everyday job of picking up dirt.  My ex-wife got it and still using it.  I need to get one.  Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too.  Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy.  3 strikes. your out Hoover.  I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
2,"I have owned this can opener for 3 years now and I am still mostly happy with it. It features comfortable rubber grip handles and an ergonomicle hand crank (my favorite part). Due to the design. I notice less stress and strain on my hands and wrists using this product than I had with cheaper models. I have not noticed any rusting or other problems as far as functionality is concerned. The rubber handles have loosened a bit and slide down occassionally. but this has not been problematic as of yet. All and all it has been a good product and if I ever needed a new one. I would be willing to buy this same model again."
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
11,"I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat. a bow. and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)"
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
7,"Using peanut butter and marshmallows in a papercup as bait I have trapped and transported 4 out of a family of 5 raccoon away from my Koi pond.  I take them 8 miles away and release them near a small river.  Only one left is one of the teenagers. I'll probably get them next week.  If I had hired a &#34;critter getter&#34; to trap them. they would have killed them which I didn't want.Easy to set. easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside.  I like the way it opens. I cover the trap with a towel so they can't see me and just pop the door up.  The minute they see the opening. they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas.  Also recommend that you put some wood underneath the cage in your car to protect your interior.  Anything they can reach they will try to use to claw their way out."
8,"There's a good article comparing the flea products: [...]The condition of the surrounding and pets all need to be considered before choosing the right product that suits your needs. I have a cat and dog. My dog is a flea magnet and the only product that works for him is Revolution and I love the fact that it's a heart worm prevention med also. However I put the cat on Program since she is an indoor cat and I feel more comfortable using this on her because my dog licks my cat but not vice versa. I use the Greenie pill pockets to wrap the tablet and has no problem at all enticing her to eat it. So far this combination works perfect for me. Every animal is different. It takes a little trial and error to find the best product for that animal specifically."
7,"Very happy with the product.  The heat is consistent and I love the ability to adjust airflow.  The only suggestion and reason for 4 starts instead of five is that condensation tends to drip out.  The plastic could have been moulded with the lip turned up and drain ridges put in which would have kept the condensation in.  It doesn't pour out or anything but I've had to put a piece of cardboard and a garbage bag under the unit to prevent it from ruining my table.  Also happy with Amazon shipping to Japan for me since. even with shipping. it's cheaper than what is available here.  Will definitely be ordering more Hydrofarm products in the future."
5,"People complain that these aren't really rolling string trees. despite the fact that the description *never* says or even implies they are. in fact. 'rolling' string trees.  Honestly. they don't need to be. at least for most guitars.  These small. round guides are superior to the flat. wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings.  Less contact means less friction. less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don't have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move.I put them on a cheap Telecaster copy I have and noticed the results immediately. and I did not replace either the tuners or the nut. those are still the cheap stock parts.If you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot. rollers might be a little better. but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade (anyone can change them. all you need is a screwdriver). it was a no brainer for my Telecaster."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
6,"This divider/label kit helps you step by step through the process of printing labels for your dividers. either with a downloaded Word template (which I used. with Word 2003) or online.  (Word 2007 comes with the template already. according to the package.)  Once you download it. it will appear under an 'Avery' tab when you open the 'New Office Document' menu.  I tried printing both text and picture labels. and fed the label sheet twice through the printer - it came out looking great and was as easy to apply as in the photo.  You can also print labels for both the fronts and backs of your tabs at the same time.  There is even a test printing sheet as well as extra labels to attach separately in case you want to reuse old dividers.  The binder is also very nice. with a rubber-coated lever and two pockets inside both the front and back covers."
1,"I had purchased (on Amazon) a battery operated remote door bell which I added to my front door.  Needless to say. the little 12 volt battery that came with the doorbell was an unknown brand and didn't last very long.  I could not locate the replacement battery in my local area grocery and drug stores.  I looked on Amazon and sure enough. they had them available!  I was especially pleased the batteries were Energizer. exactly the type I needed. and was a two-pack!  I really do tell my friends that if they can't find something. or if they do and it's too expensive or too far to drive to get it. look on Amazon!"
4,"Because this is one show I watched in the 90s and never forgot. I was grateful to find it on DVD now.  And there is a bonus of episodes from a follow-up series to the original. something I missed when it was aired.  Michael Kitchen is a riot. sublime in his comedic delivery.  The romantic leads are wildly hot.  All the supporting actors are perfectly cast.  There is one actor whose accent is so thick. I barely understand what he says; however. his acting is so clear. I totally get what is going on in his scenes.  There's a brief scene with a dog....  You don't want to miss any of this program."
11,"This is an amazing game for any Zombie enthusiast. First of all I have only played one other board game and that is ZOMBIES!!!. Now that is a good game but this one truly blows that one out of the water! First of all you get these sturdy game pieces and lovely plastic miniatures. secondly you can choose different types of scenarios that change up the game ...think of it as choosing a different zombie horror movie and lastly it is encouraged that you make your own scenario. They supply you with extra pieces so you can modify any scenario or make your own. The rules do take a game or two to finally master. but once you have got it down its all fun and mayhem afterwards."
2,"I picked up a OXO Y-peeler. like the above model. except with a red inlay on whim in Krogers. about.. 5 to 6 years ago? I still have it and it works great! Tried to take good care of it.This peeler is perfect if you have Big hands. and want a functional peeler. and want to peel manually like nobodies business. Used to use a peeler. that wasn't a Y shape. but was just straight with a long U shaped point blade. My hand cramped up so bad all the time! And I'm a young guy. So I got this and have never looked back.I absolutely love this kitchen tool!Anyways. this will be a good investment when peeling potatoes or carrots. Haven't really used it on anything else."
4,"I don't really want to talk about the religious aspect that everyone is arguing about... I just think that this is a great movie. It is done very well and looks stunning. The acting was great. It is a violent movie and I don't think anyone knows for sure if Jesus' death was that violent... in fact I don't think anyone knows for sure if God even exists (that's why they call it faith right?) People who say they are 100% certain that God exists are always whack jobs. People who say they are 100% sure that God doesn't exist are just as whacky. But one thing is certain. this is a very entertaining film that is done well and really should be considered one of the best movies of all time."
12,"At first glance this game may look easy but its not.You could spend many hours just trying to figure out what everything does and even more making your numerous attempts at unsuccesful cities.The graphics are pretty good  but you need an intense system for the game to run smoothly.Maxis has once  again added their own humorous touch to the game which can add to the fun  factor.You probably won't get sick of this game very fast. If you are  looking for a huge improvement over SC2K you won't find it here.I have made  this game sound bad but it really isn't. this a very fun and challenging  game and would reccomend it only to one who likes this particular genre."
7,"This a very good tool and cuts very nicely. I agree that it does a nice job cutting. however. I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches. and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure. That happens when the handles are fully extended or not...so 4 stars. With that said. it works as advertised. It can be locked closed. Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily. I just wish the handles were sturdier."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack. Best Buys no where else. I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself. but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way. I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards.ffsalsa"
7,"I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results.  I've used a large outdoor smoker for years. and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker.  I used it to prepare chicken breasts. and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender. and had just the right amount of smoke flavor.  I'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables.  It's a great way to add flavor to food. and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made.  I could smell the smoke as the food cooked. but it wasn't intense and there was no smoke in the house.  I'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds. but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker."
10,"When I got the tool. the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel. and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws. and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined. parallel surfaces. and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt. it is.  After aligning the fence. the machine works. but out of the factory. it was not even close."
6,"I hate wrapping gifts. so I really liked how easy the tape made it.  You couldn't see the fingerprints. it has a nice finish to it. and the pieces are precut to a nice short length.  I found this all very helpful.  I read on one of the reviews that there was a complaint about the amount of tape that was on these rolls. and I have to agree that there wasn't as much. but for me that was a minor negative.  I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient."
12,"This is the best racing game i've ever played and the most funest. The game has a cool unique to a racing game. it is tons of fun. and you can play either Mario. Luigi. Peach (The Princess). Toad. Yoshi. Bowser(King Koopa) & Donkey Kong. There are three types of trophies you can recieve. either the Mushroom trophy. Flower Trophy. Star Trophy and A Special Trophy. Cool Hu. Well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone. Peace OutIf you liked this game then check out all of the Mario Games."
10,"I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble. install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one. but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong. you'll need help. but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended."
4,"This is the most accurate and inspiring of the Passion Plays ever done on film.Those who find it alarmingly brutal miss the fact that the Crucifixion of Christ was beyond brutal.Without the suffering of Jesus. the Christian religion is pointless.I cannot watch this film very frequently. but I well remember the first time it was screened in Houston on Ash Wednesday.The Catholics. with ashes on their foreheads. quietly watched. The Evangelicals came to their seats with big boxes of popcorn. which they dropped on the floor as they witnessed the horror of the performance. Christianity is not a saccharinesque religion.. Many people learned this for the first time as they watched The Passion of the Christ."
6,"This is an excellent double sided mounting tape for small items. However. you have to make sure the surface you attach it to is absolutely clean. If there is oil. dirt. grease. etc. it is not going to stick for very long. And the surface you attach it to has to be dry and stay dry and it has to be strong enough to hold whatever you are mounting. If the surface has been waxed. it may not stick for very long. All you have to do is clean the area where you are going to use it and it will do an excellent job. This is a light to medium strength mounting tape and should not be subject to heat or vibration. If you want to mount something in your car or boat. there are other very high strength mounting tapes. If you want to mount a small picture or similar then use 4 good sized pieces. one in each corner. don't use just one in the middle. This mounting tape would be excellent for mounting poster boards."
2,"...the spring rusts. I own both the 12' (for normal indoor cooking) and the 16' (for grilling). I have used both countless times. They grip food well and you feel as though you have a firm hold of the hood too. In all the times I have used them. I have discovered two main flaws. The first flaw is the flexibility (bend-ibility)of the 'hands'. the part of the tongs that actually touches the food. If you grasp the food too tight. they bend. This means the they will not close tight without bending them back into shape. The second is the metal used in the spring. This metal is prone to rust and when it rusts the tongs no longer have their normal spring and often get stuck. My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a hight quality."
11,"This game is a lot of fun. specially when you have too many players for things like dominion. ticket to ride and catan. The game is a little complicated to play at first. as there are several roles and different buildings you need to understand properly to form a strategy. Yet with not too much time you will start understanding the patterns and the dynamics that form each player's strategy.One particular thing that I enjoy in this game is its impression of unbalance (which is fun. as it makes you feel like you are winning). but in the end. it turns out players have nearly the same score. The details are what count. not the majestic buildings."
7,"I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are. was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder. and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one. filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this. and I am thinking in time. just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill. refill. etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside. it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made. it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions."
11,"Some of our friends introduced us to this game. and after playing it one time we knew we would soon be purchasing it. The game is very simple to learn and easy to play - simply matching colors or shapes. While there is some strategy to the game. there is more luck involved than anything else. One thing I especially like about this game is the wood block construction. Extremely durable! This is not an educational game. so if that is one of your primary goals for game purchases. look elsewhere. However. if you're just looking for a new family game that you can play at parties. at the campsite. at church youth functions. or just around the kitchen table. this is the one you're looking for! You will not be disappointed!"
11,"We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together. but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination. and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun. and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night."
1,"We use these bags in two of our trashcans in the kitchens.  We have a kitchen on the main floor and in the basement and these 13 gallon bags are just the right size for our kitchen trash containers.  By the end of the week they are pretty full and we dump some smaller trash cans into the sacks as there is still room and then they are full to the top.  I have never had one leak or tear on me and I like the tie flaps to close the bag securely and to carry it outside.This is a good product and we will continue to use it and I recommend it to you.  The price here is high compared to what we are paying and you might want to shop around."
2,"Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor. easy to clean filter and good accessory package.  Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors. However. it has 2 problems.  First. the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily.  It has no reinforcing. so you don't want to step on it or bend it around a corner.  Second. the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length.  This gives the hose a little strength. but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds.  I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it.  If it feels weak. I need to take off the hose and shake it clean.  In good clean condition. it works as well as any canister."
8,"My 2 yr old standard schnauzer will chew through anything.  I've been searching for a bully stick that will last more than 20 minutes with her. and still haven't found one.  For some reason though. she plays with this toy differently.  Handles it gingerly and is more interested in playing catch with herself than tugging and tearing.  That said. this is the first non-animal-part toy that has lasted more than 5 minutes.  It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours. which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last.Update: one eye is missing from the bear. but all the seams appear to be intact and she's still very engaged.  Very impressed with the item. although I'm sure it would be torn to shreds if it was her choosing."
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
12,"As part of the core Team at SONY Computer Entertainment that worked on the development of the Crash series. and helped propel Naughty Dog into the Video Game Industry as a premier Developer. with these million seller Crash games. I'm proud of what we did. and I STILL enjoy the Crash Bandicoot gameplay and graphics. Buy them up folks. I had to buy these because my little girl gave my copies to her little friends back in the '90s. I hadn't given it much thought until now. and realized that I just had to have my own copies again. Yes. I STILL have PlayStation 1. 2. & 3 consoles and WILL buy the second generation PS-4."
1,"Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs. this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution. I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn't as close as premium blades. the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally. I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal. covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help."
4,"This is MUCH improved from her first video. The music is not annoying. she's got good people demonstrating proper positioning. and I really like how she narrates instead of talking while doing the routine. I think more videos should do that! I love her opening prayer and how the moves really put me in a spirit of praising God.This routine just seems too easy. like for senior citizens. It's nice to do on a rest day to keep myself limber and for meditating on the wonder of God.I will look for her new power version looking for something more challenging for the muscles.  Keep it up Laurette! We all learn from trial and error."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
10,"This is an excellent sander.  I really work this machine and it just keeps on going.Brace your feet. hang on tight and keep on moving; this is a powerful sander.I usually sand with three grits and when changing belts it is rarely necessary to touch the tracking adjustment.The 4 inch footprint is more resistant to tipping than my 3 inch sander and ergonomics are perfect for me.Cons:  There were 2 flat spots on the metal front roller 180 degrees apart which cause a barely discernible bump but it's not really a problem.  It just sometimes makes it hard to tell if a belt is about to separate or not.Recommended."
6,"Avery always makes great labels and gives you the best templates and software to go with them. so it's no surprise that I'm very pleased with their clear easy-peel address labels. The healthy 1' x 2 5/8' size allows for plenty of font choices.I use tan parchment-colored envelopes for my business and slapping a white label on them gives a second-class mail look.  The clear labels impart a more professional appearance. and while I don't know it to be a fact. I think recipients are far more likely to pay attention.Finally. the easy peel feature prevents both frustration and inappropriate words in the office. Highly recommended."
5,"After trying out a few other styles and brands. I settled on this stand. wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall. The overall design of the stand is great. but I had to return my first stand. as there were severe quality issues with the finish. There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn't stick to the metal. and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out. The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right. once it was clamped down to the main stand body. Disappointingly. the replacement unit I received also has this issue. but only about 7-10 degrees worth. I'm going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish. and truly worthy of my guitar."
6,"I have two different laser printers. each with a special envelope slot that is meant to feed envelopes so that you can print an address directly on each envelope. There are two problems with both. First. you can feed only one envelope at a time (they won't accomodate a stack of envelopes). Secondly. half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem. So. I have given up on running envelopes through my laser printers.The Avery Easy Peal mailing label sheets fit into the standard 8.5' by 11' tray and feed flawlessly through the print track. I can print 300 labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly.The drawback is. you must run a sheet of 30 labels through the printer even if you need only one label. But if you have a lot of mailing to do. this generous quantity of labels helps get the job done quickly and inexpensively."
12,"Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a well-made game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles.  The battles. which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy. are simplified by Z-Targeting. which aims all attacks at the enemy.  It takes a long time to beat (months). as any good RPG (Role-Playing Game) should.  Unfortunately. it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls. although they're pretty easy. in messages which you usually must read.  I suggest this for all people. especially those that enjoy a good challenge."
5,"Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I'd had in high school.  This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness.  I did want collapsible legs. which this has. and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand.  Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory. and has been in constant use for months now.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The height is easily adjustable. and the shelf tilt is easy too.  Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid!"
12,"I'm 23 now. got the game when it first came out when I was around 12. Still the bet snowboarding game of all time. So much fun that I still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game. Has a time attack mode. trick mode. racing series. and a mixture of them all. Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself. Great game...that's highly reccomended."
10,"I purchased this for my Delta Platinum Contractor's Saw with Unifence.  Installation is pretty straight-forward. although I have to modified my Rockler outfeed table a bit to accommodate one of the mounting brackets.  Once installed. the blade guard works very well.  I particularly like the easily-removable splitter -- very handy when I am using my sliding table.  My only gripe is that I wish there is a vacuum port in the blade guard.  The saw dusts seem to be focused to fly directly back at you -- I guess that is a good reminder not to stand directly inline with the blade!"
6,"If you're fed up with half-wits pestering you at home in the evening. this device is a godsend. I had been receiving an average of three calls each evening. which I tried to deal with by turning down the answering machine. But I still heard the 'beep' each time a call was received. Worse yet. some of the callers felt the need to leave a message.The TeleZapper cuts off these calls before they even get to your answering machine. or to you. There are competing products that cost less. but this one is the most effective that I've found."
2,"I love this peeler!  I had one just like it for many years (until I somehow lost it!) and it worked perfectly EVERY time.  I couldn't remember where I bought it and couldn't find another one in any stores - until I finally looked on Amazon.  Thank you. Amazon!  Not only is the gripper handle perfect. the blade works as it should.  I purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and I was very disappointed.  Their blades kept slipping over the vegetables without cutting.  Very frustrating.  I even tried a kitchen Aid brand and hated it.  So save yourself the frustration and the tired hands and just buy this one!"
7,"Bought two after watching neighbor's do fairly well except for watering neglect.This year will have her hang closer to our yard so we can keep eye on it.These two. when set. will be accessible to daily watering as needed.  It doesn't look to be any 'foam ring' in these 2.  BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts' into dirt/potting mixture. which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight. as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews. Sounds like the typical of past 4 yrs of IMPORTED product where the MFG has reduced the quality of the fabric."
10,"Earlier this year. I found an affordable LED reading lamp I liked at Target. but sadly. it stopped working this week. Hoping for an even better alternative. I checked again at Target. and also at Ikea. Target still offered a variation of the lamp I'd bought before. but for triple the price of this similar LED lamp from Ikea.I particularly like the compact light housing on the Ikea lamp. and the heavy base that ensures the light stays where I aim it. My only complaint is that the power switch is in the power cord rather than a toggle switch on the base as it is on the Target lamps. The light output is also a bit less. but I consider that an advantage for reading in bed.My wife doesn't like the look of the Ikea lamp. but I really do like it. so form your own opinion from the photos.Recommended."
12,"This is the best puzzle game ever made. Although I love the Puyo Puyo style games (Dr. Mario. Columns. Bust A Move. etc.). I have to say that Tetris is the cream of the crop. After all. Tetris is what sold the original Gameboy. and it was logical to make Tetris DX a launch title when the Game Boy Color came out. I bought the GBC the day it was released. and I bought Tetris DX the next week. and Tetris DX is one of the most-played titles on my GBC...the sheer addictiveness of the game is so frickin' awesome. and I love how blocks fall faster in later levels (so it has an 1980's old-school style to it...I love &quot;old school&quot; games)."
5,"I can't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer (FOX).  If you haven't started in the mic-collecting business. trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below. you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one.  I've always wondered why I can't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet. and I finally realize it's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't.It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives (face it. those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use).  It's very directional and 'selective' (rejecting room ambience and background noise). so it's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications.  But for announcing. broadcasting. vocal performance and vocal recording. I don't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
4,"I would give this video 10 stars if I could-it is the most wonderful of all the S.S videos I have bought(and I have about 20) The characters are incredibly adorable. and make the process of learning the alphabet fun. not just a task for kids.Unlike a few of the other reviewers who think Baby Bear and his 'lisp' should not have been the focus. are being ridiculous-there are alot of kids out there with speach impediments who talk just like Baby Bear or even worse-I know of 3 in my daughters Pre-k class. Sesame Street shows kids in wheelchairs and kids with Down Syndrome on the show. I guess they should not be on the show either????So. I think he is a welcome addition to the video. Check your attitudes at the remote before playing the video for your kids if you feel that way-it may be annoying to adults-but it is what the kids can relate to and understand that matters."
1,"The G-U-M stimulators do exactly what they should do - get the bad stuff out and away from around your teeth.  Even after brushing long and thoroughly. there is still stuff left under the gum rims. The G-U-M Stimulator tip removes the bad stuff without hurting your gums.The difficult part about the G-U-M stimlators is getting the rubber tips onto the metal handle.  It takes a lot of hand strength.  Moistening the tip with hot water helps. but it still takes a lot of hand strength.  The other downside is that a single stimulator is good for only about 3 or 4 uses - then the tip begins to break.  Time to wrestle a new tip onto the handle."
7,"Purchased this snow removal tool for my wife. who uses her car on a daily basis for work.  While the car trunk is already filled with an assortment of semi-helpful gadgets. assuring her safety on the road. the Sno Brum is unquestionably in the top 5.  The tool is simple. effective. and does &#8220;what it says it does&#8221; easily. The tool doesn&#8217;t scratch the car body. is lightweight. and yet durable.  Don&#8217;t hit the snowy roads this winter without it!  All the more in Connecticut. a state in which a regulation will go into effect whereby cars may be fined up to $1000 for excess snow and ice flying off."
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."

12,"THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy. difficult to totally master. and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original. and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good. better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time. an eternally youthful forest girl. a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain. a rebellious fish woman. a determined royal guard. a sexy thief. the &quot;princess&quot;. and of coure. Ganon the bad guy."
4,"One of my child hood favorite G-films released on a DVD of incredible quality. This DVD has even more special features than 'Mothra vs. Godzilla'. with an image gallery included. This time David Kalat was the `G-expert' selected for the commentary. I think he delivers an entertaining performance as he mainly focuses on the evolution of Godzilla from a serious villain to a campy and comical hero. He tells us his opinion on the matter and how it really affected the original series. The image gallery has some nice photos with captions and in the end another great classic media release."
8,"This may be the best of all the Mutipet toys! Previously gave great reviews of others. but this one never stops! They bite it.  step on it. sit on it and hide it from each other. It always gives itself away tho with its 'OOOOONNNOOOOOO!!!!' I keep 2 around here and have given several to friends. I think it's particularly popular with those of us who remember Mr Bill. but it sure translates to the dogs!While these are really durable for us I don't think real chewers will take long to dismantle this. My guys are over 80lbs bot don't chew or pull things apart."
10,"I bought this saw 22 years ago and have used it since. I am a professional electrician and use a circular saw from time to time on the job for wood braces and supports. The saw has never been serviced or repaired. Some 7 years ago. I bought a Freud carbide blade from Home Depot. That's all I've done to it. and it keeps on going and going.  When it no longer works. I'll get another. But. at the rate that it last and last. who knows when that will be."
2,"Cuisinart. I thought. built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this 'blender' but I am not one of them."
1,"There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!"
6,"I'm a big fan of printing my own return address labels and these are the best ones so far.I went to the Avery website for the free templates and using Microsoft Word.I printed the best labels I've ever printed & it was faster and more accurate than it's ever been.The labels themselves are are the best I've seen so far.you just bend the sheet at the column and the edge of the label pops up so you can peel it off.so much easier than in the past.The reason these are my favorite labels is because they are 1/2 an inch tall and 1 3/4 inch long and are perfect for putting on printed return forms instead of trying to fit my clumsy handwriting in the tiny writing space.I really like these...They're Great!"
11,"Not very easy for my little kids to use but it works. They get confused on the up or down arrow. Not sure on the settings until after a minute. then the clock shows the minute/time. They like to see the seconds too but this doesn't  have the seconds. I keep one in the van so when we are on the road I can keep track of their reading. The library gives them awards/prizes for minutes read in the summer. They will read for prizes and this is a good way for me to keep track."
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
4,"Maybe this is all part of THE JOKE; to get people caught up in the reemergence of Kaufman fame and then to purchase a totally CRUMMY product. HAHAHAHA! I bet Bob Zmuda (Andy's best friend) was a behind this. HAHAHAHA!  Just reading the reviews got me to laugh. Part of Andy's act was bombing on  purpose. Go back and watch this again or compare the part in the movie when  Kaufman wanted the ABC special to look as if it was messing up. (MAN are  some people gullible...)"
11,"Great instructional book and human body model.  It is smaller than I thought.  Other reviews warn that the parts of the body will get scattered about the house if you let young child play unsupervised.  Well. my science savvy 4 year old grandson and 6 year old granddaughter started out exploring the parts and were able to put the body back together themselves.  However. after a while. they created some other games and now. about half the parts are unaccounted for--I think their dog ate some.  So parents. this is great for older children. it is a great tool to learn about the body. and great for younger ones with supervision.  Has anyone seen a spleen?"
5,"I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one. it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords. when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz."
8,"I gave this to my mother for Christmas. She has an old cat who loves to play in water and she had always talked about some day getting him a pet water fountain. I had read a few other reviews and was a little leery as to how well this would work. but gave it a try.Her cat loves it! From day 1 there have been no problems with it. And best of all. it VERY quiet. You can't hear it at all! She has it set up in her living room. I didn't even know it was there.I would just make sure you always have it filled with water so the pump doesn't burn out on you. Because cats drink so much water with this. when you first get it. you should watch the water levels so that you get an idea on how often you should replenish the water supply.Absolutely great product!"
2,"I love this fan. We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it. It's pretty simple to figure out. It has three settings: High. medium. low. This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air. It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high (which is kind of expected).Overall. this is a purchase I have not regretted. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan. You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store. I got mine at Dollar General."
12,"Once again. Crash Bandicoot takes a big step up to greatness! 'Crash Bandicoot 3: WARPED' was fantastic! It was even better than the second one. Better graphics. story. music. and gameplay.The enemies were fun just like in the first one and the new vehicles available were awesome. like the bi-planes. space fighter. Pura the Tiger. and the jet-ski. Also. it wasn't as difficult to gather the Crystals and Gems as it was in the second part. The environments were better and the new powers that Crash Bandicoot acquires are totally awesome: the Super Belly-Flop. Speed Shoes. Death-Tornado Spin Attack. and the totally awesome Fruit Bazooka! This is definitely one of the best of the games in the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy. You Crash fans MUST get this game!"
7,"I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010. I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag. and WOW!!! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe!!  It was so delicious and jucy. I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat. and now I know. No turning back now. I must try some Ribs with these chips next. and a Roasting Chicken.....mmmmmmmmm!!  Highly recommended. Will purchase again."
12,"my uncle gave this to me for christmas. i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil 4. then i knew what this game was. i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it. then i got resident evil 2 and tried the uncut version.it was ok. i started playing it now and then. a month later. i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them. And the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticks.and instead of gettin only 2 ink ribbons. you get 4 every time u pick them up. the bad part is that the graphics haven't improved. it is also very scary. like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me. Still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these. go with the uncut one."
10,"I bought this saw and have used it a lot in refurbishing an old house.  It is a powerful and excellent saw and it cuts exceptionally true even through very thick stock.  The only problem some people might have with it is that it is quite large and heavy.  I have large hands so this is not a serious problem but thank God I did not buy the even larger Bosch model which is REALLY huge!  Also. changing blades is a pain if you do not do it all the time since the procedure is overly complicated.  No wonder they put it on the barrel of the saw!"
12,"Golden Eye on the Nintendo 64 needs no introduction it redefined the FPS genere it had great controlls for it's day stuck as close as it could with the movie it was a major killer app for the 64 around  97-98. The music was good the graphics were decent enough there dated now but this game was & still is the $**t. Golden Eye never has failed on any level I still play it from time to time & the multiplayer back in the summer of 98 me my friends or my brother or his friends or my cousin we all played the multiplayer to death. Should you get this game well it's been out since the late 90's & & if you never played it your missing out it warrants a purchase of a N 64 for this game alone. Golden Eye for the 64 is as good if not better than movie."

Don't be an idiot.  If you wouldn't allow a stranger to inject you with a syringe containing an unknown substance. don't eat/inhale unknown substances either. because it is no different than being injected."
8,"In all honesty. I'd rather not use this type of chemical product on my dogs.  I resisted for as long as I could but the so-called natural products were. sadly. ineffective.  I was pulling off a tick a day from them and I found a few of the little suckers crawling on me.  That was the last straw. so enter Frontline.  Bottom line. it works better than anything else I've tried. There's nothing more to say about it. except if someone knows about an effective natural/less chemically product. please let me know."
11,"My daughter and two granddaughters received this for Christmas.  There ages are 10. 6. and 4.  The little ones need some help from their mom but it was a great experience anyway.  My 10 year old is hiding the book until she gets it published; to surprise us with her life story..  The kids of all ages really enjoyed it.  High quality. will purchase it again.  Can't comment on the publishing stage as we are still in the &#34;writing the book&#34; phase."
12,"I could go on and on. but look. it is really very simple. It's hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it.So to all. always PRONTO pay attention to mister number one best sheriff student's idiotic post (i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are cool...White Trash that sums you up :) have a nice dayAnd don't forget. you hafta agree with me at all times. click on the YES button under my review. obey me. everything that has to do with good things of me"
1,"I bought these batteries thinking they where rechargable. but they aren't!These batteries lasted a very long time. I would say about 4-6x longer than my rechargeable batteries. in my ebook reader.Pro's:Long enduranceHigh power outputExcellent for both high power devices (like digital camera's or flash) as low power devices (clock or ebook reader).Cons:Non-rechargableDon't last as long as they mention on the package (4-6x not 8x longer than rechargeables. and about 2x longer than Duracell batteries)Conclusion:I would never buy these batteries for the sole reason that they are non rechargable.Otherwise they are excellent for small electronic devices like clocks and small portable radio's and ebook readers.For high power devices. though these batteries are excellent. I would especially recommend to get rechargeables!"
2,"I had a great little OXO brush with a suction cup that stuck to the side of the sink that finally needed replacing.  Sadly they don't seem to make that kind anymore.  So I replaced that with a longer handled brush and liked the price ($4.50 as an add on item) and the reviews.I wasn't sold on it the first use. but then I started getting more comfortable with the different style. and I like it.I would have liked the bristles a little closer together. but I figure I'll buy another round dish brush if need be.  It's great for glasses and even for scrubbing pans.  There is a soft plastic scraper tip for caked on stuff.I hand wash 75% of my dishes. so I use dish brushes a lot.  This is a good value dish brush and I am quite happy with it.  It's not worth paying $10 - $15 for a perfect brush when this is really good for a lot less."
12,"I played Croc 2 more often. but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun. as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff. but this did release in 1997. so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple. but the game is fun nonetheless. and for me it's a pretty timeless classic. that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money."
4,"I have been waiting for this for what seems like ever. and I have not been disapointed.  This was one of the few films that I have watched through the whole of my life and never been tired of.  Whether it was the English or Japanese version I loved it.  Everything about it was awesome and even if the DVD didn't have special features I would have purchased it the moment it touched the shelf.If you are a fan of science fiction. kaiju. or just monsters in general then do yourself a favor and pick this film up turn the lights down low (where applicable) and get ready to be amazed by the cheezy monstery goodness that came to you from a long long time ago from a far away land across the sea.A simple plot with enough mystery to keep you plugged in and enough human drama to make you car abou the characters and enough monsters  and sci fi to keep you happy.  Just watch it and see for yourself."
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
10,"These may cost a bit more but they last and save time not to mention money.  Use them to remove material that has not been coated with any type of VOC poly or paint and they will outlast other types of belts.  They are too good to use in a situation where heat and goo will clog the grit .  Better to use a cheap belt first then go to these for efficient quality removal.  Clean the belt often with a belt cleaner especially if you think it is getting so hot that it is melting the finish instead of abrading it."
2,"A pizza cutter isn't something you think about all that often until you need one. Well. I did. Not only does Pizza Hut never cut my pizzas all the way through. but frozen ones don't come with any slice cuts at all. So you gotta have one of these. My old one must have been about as sharp as a spoon because it took many. many rolls across the pizza surface to make a cut. Missed a lot and created too many super narrow slices. This little guy does it perfectly in one pass. so I'm a fool for having waited so long to buy one."
12,"It's true that Pokemon is pretty much a passing craze due to (for some odd reason) the invention of TOO MANY POKEMON! However. this game is amazing. The graphics. attack animations. and sounds are very simple compared to later installments of the series. but who cares? At the time. this was like nothing anyone had ever played! The music is extremely catchy. and there are so many things to collect. you'll just find yourself playing for hours. Also. you can trade Pokemon from other people since the Red and Blue versions have Pokemon exclusive to that version. Also. if you feel the need to 'catch 'em all.' trade starters. or evolve certain Pokemon with a trade. The bottom line: it's a great guilty pleasure and introduced what is now the most faded franchise ever!"
11,"The negative reviews this game has been getting for not being compatible with expansions are not deserved. This game is great and the best co-op board game available 2nd toDays of Wonder Shadows Over Camelot. This game is a remake by Fantasy Flight and is an improvement on the original. If you have to have the old expansions then sure buy the original game but this new verion stands on its own (I think Fantasy Flight might be working on revised expanions anyway). The artwork and design is beautiful! You really need to strategize. especially before heading into Mordor or you will lose! Non-gamers and gamers alike will both love this game! Makes a great companion toThe Hobbit Boardgame. Same artist and game designer on both."
4,"I held off watching this movie because I had heard so much about the blood and gore. But I knew that I would eventually see it. I embrace the story of Christ and the power of his teachings. Though this film contains only a few scenes of his life and ministry. the depiction of torture and the crucifixion aptly conveys a message of love - that is. what Christ was willing to suffer for all mankind. The imagery of the devil was well-placed. And. to me at least. the story moved at a good pace - not too fast. not too slow. Moreover. James Caviezel's performance was outstanding. However. I was not moved emotionally (or. spiritually) the way I had anticipated. Perhaps it was the hype. But I'm glad that it got so much (well-deserved) attention."
12,"Super Mario 64 is one of the most amazing games I've ever played. In fact. it's my second favorite game of all time. next to Super Mario Galaxy. You get to explore the large levels freely. and do most of the levels in any order you want. Gameplay and controls are simple and easy to pick up.  but they're very fun. Not only do the good graphics look 3D. but the music also sounds 3D. Some things in this game are just too great for words. it's easily the game of the decade for the 90's. easily beating out Super Mario World (The second best). which is amazing. This game is far supirior to that overrated Zelda Ocarina of Time. I rate this game 100/100. It's Perfect!"
1,"Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me. it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the 'on' button after shaving and walking away. knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel. I don't bring the cleaning unit. so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day. which (a) takes a few minutes. and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars. withholding one star just for the price."
7,"They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it. and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed. but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her."
10,"I recently picked this up for $79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it.  I already have a large heavy duty belt sander. but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy.  However. there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand.  With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates.  Mine was Made in England. though I'm not sure if they all are.  The belt tracking is automatic.  Just slip the belt on and go.  The balance is just right.  A very nicely engineered tool which I'm glad to have in the collection."
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
11,"With a fast pace and ever-changing rules and goals. this is a great game. especially if you might be pressed for time (my wife and I finished a game in about 5 minutes. which. of course. all depends on the shuffling of the deck). Pulling sci-fi elements from multiple sources (Star Trek. Star Wars. 2001: A Space Odyssey. and Firefly. to name a few). you. too. can enjoy trying to put together a crew of spacemen or discover an city of robots. Well worth the minimal cost of the deck. this game has me interested in getting some of the other themes in the Fluxx line."
5,"For a good. basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings. it's difficult to go wrong with D'Addario's EXL110s.  The range of thicknesses generally works well. and D'Addarios tend to be pretty consistent.  Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s (e.g. coating. super brightness. and so on). and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string (e.g. sets that start with 9s or 11s). but for most purposes these work great. hold their tuning well. and seem to last pretty well. too."
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
2,"There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker.  It...Cannot keep the handle tight. I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal. steam leaks out around the handles. making them hot to touch. and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word. we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market."
10,"I have owned and have regularly used this saw for over three years. As others have pointed out it is almost impossible to get 100 percent accurate cuts from this saw. Tightening the lock down knob does push the blade out of alignment. The only thing you can do to improve this is to not over tighten the knob. but keeping the blade from shifting is still problematic. There is also some play in the blade which allows it to deflect slightly from the work piece. no matter how expensive or stiff a blade you use (worse when cutting hardwoods). But I've discovered that miter saws by their nature aren't accurate enough for fine work. To get extremely accurate crosscuts you need to use an accurately tuned table saw."
11,"I can't say enough about this book and doll. I had days of fun moving it around the house for my grand children's benefit. They enjoyed looking for the next place he was hidden. The story was read over and over by request. and it kept them on their best behavior knowing Santa's elf was watching their every move. I ended up buying it from Barne's and Noble. because after ordering from Amazon backed seller and being told I'd receive it before Christmas. I received an email telling me I would get it until January 15th. Obviously too late for the holiday season. Amazon refunded my money without any issues."
6,"I love these clear labels- Avery is always top-notch. Printing on them is easy- Avery's site provides four ways that you can design and print the labels. I used the 'Avery Design and Print Online'- no downloads required. You can also download the templates to use in Word or on other programs. Anyway. Avery online has lots of designs and it's simple to use. so all I had to do was type in my address and print the labels. They dry right away and the print did not smear at all. Highly recommended product!"
2,"Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.  A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.  Never thought I'd own one (grew up with one -- home cooking). so thought I'd try it myself.So you know. bought one at Walmart (has the Wearever brand)-- $40.00. and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon's 30 day return policy (make sure you read that before buying anything here...surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days. even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences.)"
7,"I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install. just 5 min. snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me. my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits. like potato and apples. when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house."
4,"In a world where most movies have a Hollywood twist and pervert the truth of the scripture. Mel Gibson has does a wonderful job showing the pain that Jesus Christ went through for all of us. James Caviezel does an excellent job playing Christ and showing the human side and physical pain! The location of the film (where it was shot) is absolutely realistic. the characters of the film are realistic and it felt as if I was there. Without the Spirit of God. you won't enjoy the film ... you'll call it a horror film. but this film so much more. Even if you don't believe that Jesus Christ was the Christ. it is still a powerful movie ... and the question that comes to mind is how another human torture another human can like that? It is just unbelievable that we can be that cruel!"
11,"This is a great game. it has a lot of depth.  There are multiple ways to play the game to win.  You can focus your efforts in one area or diversify to gain honor in your village in several areas.  This game has tons of replay value.  I have been playing it with my 9 and 10 year old kids despite the 12 and up tag.  It is simple enough that they were easily able to play it. and complex enough that it is fun to play again and again.  5 stars. this is a great game!"
12,"This games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun. Tenchu had competant graphics for the time. though ugly by 2012 standards. The controls definately had issues but lets face it. this is the best Tenchu game to date. Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments. Years later. the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certain games you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back. This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread. The first one is the best in the series. in my opinion. Priority was never graphics or packaging. It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack."
11,"I bought this for a 7 year old and there is no way a child that small could use it.  Even an older girl -10-11 would struggle a little.  The materials and concepts are adorable. It really does have neat ideas but its just too much for a young girl to do without her mother. which is why I buy these things. because the like to do crafts on their own.  I think a 13-14 year old girl would be fine but not sure if an older girl would be interested in doing this. I'd also say if &#34;Mom&#34; is interested in helping. it would be a lot of fun. But Mom has to do the work. the kids just get to create."
1,"I bought these for my friend. who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days. I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials). so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit. and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend. at least ;)"
12,"I only gave this game 2 stars because if you're die-hard South Park fan. it's possible that you might enjoy this game... but I like South Park. and I HATED it. The controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use (you have to use the C buttons most of the time). the gameplay is repetitive and boring (all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys). and the multiplayer part is boring too. One pro is that the guns are pretty original &amp; the South Park kids say some funny things. but the novelty wears off after a while. I bought this game when it first came out. for .... and I sold it for $5 at a stoop sale... I just wanted to get rid of it. it's really that bad. If you really have to get it. at least rent it first."
11,"I've found School Zone workbooks to be useful in introducing various subjects. and to review what my child already knows.After completingTransition Math K-1. my son breezed through this workbook. Most of the pages contain counting exercises for numbers 0-12 (they had a great way of explaining zero to little kids!). and shape/pattern recognition. The intro to addition and subtraction used pictures to describe the concept.There was one page about clocks. and a few pages about sequencing and greater/less. At the end of the workbook is a review section of everything that was taught. along with an answer key. and a cute certificate.The School Zone workbook we are currently using isTime. Money and Fractions."
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
9,"I got this because it was cheap and because our pans have all warped over time.  This pan is made of very heavy durable metal.  I don't think it will ever warp considering it weights near 10 pounds.  Anyways. this is a fantastic grill.  Just made an egg on it and it cooked in like 4 minutes.  With our warped pans. it took like 15 minutes after fidgeting the pan around on the stove level to make it level with the grill.  In other words. this pan is excellent and should never warp on you.  It fits our stove perfectly and I am glad I found one this cheap."
7,"I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try. but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application."
10,"Maybe I shouldn't complain; I got this product on sale. However. everytime I cut a dado I have significant tear out on the back side of the cut and the bottom is ANYTHING but smooth - so I smooth it with a float. Also. the plastic holder broke. but I suppose that is just the way plastic containers are. As the other reviewers mentioned. hang on to your instructions - they are just a small piece of cardboard. If I had it to do all over again. I would read the other product reviews and invest in a higher priced dado set and hope that the bottom of the cut is close to being smooth. There are a lot of folks that like this product. so maybe I just got a lemon."
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
1,"I've used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well. I've had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I've been using it for a little over a month.and again it's working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again.if fact I'll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
11,"Okay. my title might be a bit confusing.  I will get back to that.  My neice and nephews came over on New Year's Day and I brought this out after everyone finished eating and carrying on.  They all loved it. but it would probably be better to bring out in the beginning of a party or get-together so you don't necessarily think it's someone trying to get you to do something solely for the game.  For instance. if you are trying to get a person to say 'no' to getting you a drink.  You ask them without having them realize that it is the game that you are playing.  Thus. if you are carrying on and talking. one might think you really do want them to get it for you.  I hope I made that clear enough.  So just 'play' it while you are chatting and not an intense 'game'.  They all loved it though."
12,"What what game I'm describing.  It's old. it's puzzling. and it's a blockbuster game.  It's. you guessed it. Myst.  And that is probably the easiest puzzle you'll get concerning Myst. too.  Since it is a popular game  that was released a quite a long time ago. you've probably heard of it by  now.  I'll just say this one thing:  If you're deaf or impatient. AVOID.  There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones...heck. even if you're  NOT deaf. it's still quite a puzzler!  But don't fret...you can beat this  game in FIVE MINUTES if you know how. and it can be found in the many game  walk-throughs of the Internet.  After all. with the difficulty of THESE  puzzles. rest assured. you'll be looking for one!"
10,"This is the third finishing sander I've owned (I got it free when I bought my compound miter saw) and of the three its the best in terms of sanding quality and noise.  However. I'd go with a random orbit sander to get better quality.My biggest complaint is that the dust attachment (DW4111) comes separately (and is not carried by very many suppliers. including Amazon).  The dust bag that comes with their random orbit sander pulls apart and fits a standard 2 1/2 inch dust hose.  Why couldn't they do that with this one?"
6,"This replaced a smaller. somewhat flimsier paper cutter and while that one was merely adequate. I feel this one is ideal for home use.  It will accurately and neatly cut up to 10 sheets of standard paper or approximately 5 pieces of medium card stock at a time.  While this may fall short in an office setting. for our needs at home. it does a great job.Although it's considerably lighter. smaller and easier to store. it shares several important features with its more expensive commercial cousins.  It has an alignment grid and a ruler to ensure that your cuts are accurate and it boasts important safety features such as a guard rail and a blade lock to prevent you from cutting something you don't intend to.  And that's a good thing too because the die-cast metal blade is very sharp to begin with and is self-sharpening as well.The Swingline ClassicCut Lite Guillotine Trimmer is a well-made product that fulfills its promise."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
11,"After reading the reviews of others. I still purchased this toy as well as the one to make silly faces of the same make - I also purchased a couple of small magnetic boards (after reading that the actual sheets to put the magnets on are not magnetic) and clip the sheets onto the magnetic board before having my grandson put the magnetic pieces in place - this works out quite well!  But. yes. I agree the sheets should be magnetic that's why I did not give this toy 5 stars!  These toys are great for stimulating imaginative play as well as learning face/body parts!"
12,"Luckily. I got my expansion pack with Donkey Kong 64.so I didn't have to spend 30 bucks for it. There is a significant difference with the 4 megabytes of extra video memory. but it's nothing revolutionary. However. because quality games like Donkey Kong and Perfect Dark require it. it must be purchased. There are also several games that don't require the expansion pack. but benefit from its use (Top Gear Overdrive. Rouge Squadron). The bottom line: if you're a 64 owner/player. you should probably buy the expansion pack."
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
10,"I bought this about a year ago. still having great results.  I use it all the time.  $10 delivered for a great torche.  It is a bit of a battery hog. but it places out some serious directional light that you can adjust.  What I like about it is the fact that it does not go from working to NOT working. when you are up in an attic or crawl space.  It will slowly start to dim so you know it is time to swap out the battery for a fresh one.  Always check to make sure it is compatible with your rechargeable batteries.  How they can free ship a quality Work Light like this for $10 is beyond me. but I am happy with the purchase one year down the road."
11,"I love the game (x-wing) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors. If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad. If you wanted to (and I suggest that you do) buy more than 3. When you start buying these minis you can't just stop at one. these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST. They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability. I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are. As with all miniatures be very careful when handling. Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor. Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them."
9,"This Spalding Tack Basketball is very tacky. It makes it easy to palm the ball and provides a light soft touch. Using the ball mainly on indoor courts. it holds up well. I'm doutbful that the texture could withstand a lot of use on an outdoor court. but after a few uses outside. it is still in perfect condition.I like this ball a lot. but I only gave it 4 stars. because I noticed that whenever we pick the 'game ball' for our pickup games. everyone shies away from these balls."
7,"This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased.  I bought one last year and then again one this year. (The first one still works great)  I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges.  So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature.  As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area."
4,"Honestly to say the least i thought this movie was going to be an ok movie. something to watch when it comes out on dvd or cable. but my cousins had invited me to the movies. who were going to pay for me so i went. this movie was so emotional. anyone who doesnt feel any emotion to this movie. is absolutely heartless. i recommend seeing. but not constantly. maybe once in a long while. its not a movie to keep watching over and over but a good movie to own. I without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Great job Mr. Gibson on a directorial accomplishment."
2,"We got rid of the automatic can opener because we wanted one that could easily be cleaned after each use.  We do not put the Oxo Good Grips into the dishwasher. but we do rinse it after each use.  After a few years use. even tho the blade itself has no rust. the recessed screw area and portions of the handle has rusted badly.  You'd think that it would not be that costly to use stainless screws. washer. and nuts. and it would certainly improve the quality greatly.  It works easily and smoothly enough. even though it is a little bulky for smaller hands and in the drawer.  We thought that by purchasing one of the more expensive brands. it would not rust. so that part is disappointing."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
10,"This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints. I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project.  It came out beautiful without a hitch. Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly. I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have. There is one caveat. you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler. They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process. I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop."
9,"I am by no means an expert knife sharpener. Although I am happy to say I have some very nice knives. I've always felt a little stupid for not having the skill nor the equipment to properly sharpen my knives. I bought this stone and I have to say that it allows even a novice to do a fine job.In fact. I have nothing but good things to say about this stone set. I am SURE than an expert knife sharpener would have a different frame of reference but it allows me to put a razor-sharp edge on 154CM. 440. S30V and M390 blades that I own. I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,"As most movies. this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out. it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph. his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)."
12,"I recieved this game for one of my birthday's many years ago. At first I was excited...but when I played it...oh boy. The Graphics were horrible. too rough and generic. To make matters worse. they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.The missions were dull. Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse. you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping. so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun. but it gets dull fast. Basicly. it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points. other than that. this is probably the worst game I have ever played. Don't buy this game...rent it at most..or borrow it."
7,"A decent quality product that appears to be more or less accurate however. I'm not thrilled with the fairly ambiguous rating system for the test results:  I conducted all four tests on a veggie garden soil sample.  The pH test was great - clear results.  The N. K and P test parameters are pretty loose. though.  Essentially. you can tell whether your soil is deficient but it's pretty difficult to discern the difference between the &#34;adequate&#34; reading and the reading indicating an overabundance of the given substance.  I posted a customer pic on the vendor's listing to illustrate results.  Who knows if they will post it.  I don't think I would re-purchase this item."
12,"I've played this game when I first got the Playstation around the year of 1997. First Mature rated game and after all of these years I return back to the dungeon to claim victory. Luckily. I did. Deathtrap Dungeon is not for the gamer who is use to FPS. Fighters or 3D Games that runs on the Quake Engine. This game is for collector's of games when they were in the early stages of become Platinum Hits in the world of gaming as of today. The game works fine but. keep in mind that when you order this game get ready for a journey and one heck of a challenge. Its not hard but. this is a game that you really need patience with."
1,"This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things. but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles. so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle.) and for spice bottles. and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned 'baby bottle' brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles. glasses. etc. and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!"
2,"Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff... NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner"
7,"I have been making compost for several years now. I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it. I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up. This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going. If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens. then this starter is pretty much unnecessary. I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with. If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile."
1,"After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product."
10,"My previous blade was an old craftsman 6' dado. Not that i have anything against craftsman (my table saw is great). but these things were so old and worn that they burned the wood away instead of cutting it. This influenced me to get a new set. I am glad i did. With this set. the saw dosen't even bog down in going through the wood. Wonderful to be able to cut something without buring it. Cuts an *almost* flat-bottomed dado. I have only done cuts about 3/8 wide max. and it seems that the chippers leave a *slight* raised area at the middle. I am not sure if this happens with larger sizes. The carbide teeth on the chippers are nice and large. which makes me happy. Now. if it can only help me think straight and not make four left legs instead of two left and two right. Oh well. I'll have to practice more."
1,"I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine. and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts. and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse. adjusting equipment. finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday. all-the-time uses. the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE. which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity. utility. and durability."
12,"I have never played anything like this since. Everything from Sly  Racoon. to Ratchet and Clank. owe it to this.Wicked witch Gruntilda takes Banjo's sister to hey layer. miles away in a realistic 3D cartoon world.Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it. You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps. Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way. You can fly. It was amazing. A full adventure all the way to end. We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again. The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time. It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one. This is one of the best N64 games ever."
9,"We've had this stove for upwards of 25 years. and it has withstood the test of time. weather. and all kinds of camping conditions. The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska. Canada's wild lakes (for canoe and kayak camping) and on our average family summer camping vacations.It is lightweight. sturdy and a great way to prepare hot cakes. eggs and coffee in the morning.For larger families. there are of course larger Coleman stoves. But for a family of two to four. this item is perfect."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
1,"I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff.  After about a week of use. once a day every day. I notice an obvious difference in my skin.  Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer.  I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump. I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy. and this one is no exception.  I would certainly recommend this product!"
5,"I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment. Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy. I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version. Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle.I've owned it for a couple of months. used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times. Zero hum or buzz from the unit. I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board."
6,"My wife was having soreness in her wrists that may have signaled the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome. I ordered the Belkin Wave Rest wrist pad. and since she started using it. the soreness has subsided. She loves the pad. It's about an inch wider than the keyboard she's using. so she doesn't have to move her hands off the pad. I've used it a few times. and I liked it enough that I may get one for myself.I think the wrist pad is worth trying for anyone who may be developing carpal tunnel syndrome or any related problem."
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
4,"David Barton. as a first-class researcher. has furnished the indisputable historical proof of the godly heritage in the founding of America. Watch and learn as you explore the fascinating details. events. and personalities of US history. Great care is given to the unfolding drama of our nation's godly tradition as the DVD set covers a massive amount of captivating amazing-but-true stories.Some of the topics covered are how faith influenced American:- Education- Religious freedoms- Civil and judicial domains- Cultural and societal arenas- Separation of Church and State- And much moreOver twenty episodes that will thrill you and your whole family. Great for church Bible study or home school."
6,"These are great. functional labels at a very reasonable price.  The 2x4-inch size is big enough for hand-written addresses and still fits 10 to a sheet for economy's sake. many more labels per sheet than the slightly larger sizes without much loss of usability.  The 'TrueBlock' ability to hide what's behind them -- seemingly due to a gray layer behind the labels' white surface. like primer under a coat of paint -- is nice. though this was never a real problem for other labels to begin with.  Simply put. these work great for their purpose."
9,"This is a very nice street hockey set.  The sticks are very durable and they assemble fast with a phillips screwdriver.  The net is assembled by pressing the PVC tubes into the corner joints; Easy to do!  Both sticks work for left or right handers: Only slightly can you notice that one is for left and the other is for right.  However. we have all kinds of neighbor kids use them and they NEVER are concerned about the &#34;proper&#34; fitting of the stick.  They just use them....PERIOD!  Again. a great product and price."
10,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits . which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit . you can't go wrong with this one."
10,"I really wanted to like this saw. but ultimately. it is too cumbersome for my taste.  Basically. this is an old fashioned tool that has its merits. but could benefit from modernization.Cons:-Offset from left side of shoe to the blade is ~3 9/16'. making using a straight edge saw guide not the easiest.-My saw arrived with a miscalibrated bevel indicator such that the 0 degree bevel setting was not in fact perfectly square with the blade.-No spindle lock to change the blade -- you have to manually immobilize the blade.-Knurled knobs for depth of cut and bevel adjustments are difficult to adjust and fall off if you unscrew too far.-Motor feels a little bit underpowered and takes a while to get up to speed.-No case.-Worm drive requires checking and maintaining oil level.-Expensive for its lack of modern features.Pros:-Stiff and stable shoe plate that is adequately sized for good support.-Very durable.-Fairly light weight and nimble.-Worm drive provides lots of torque.-Classic tool."
11,"I had great expectations from all the position 4 and 5 star reviews of this game. I have a few board based fantasy games like Descent and Heroscape. both great games giving hours of replayability. and obviously high quality of design and materials. This one disappoints. All of the pieces give the word MINIATURE and new definition. The pieces are so small they are in the description realm of RIDICULOUS. FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity. Some of the pieces. like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4' in height and diameter.  The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well. The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old's hand. The board is quite large. about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard. Not much here folks. especially for the cost of the game. This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price."
9,"Thank you for the nice ear protectors!I have already put them to the test and they work great since my ears have become more sensitive over time and a product like this is like heaven sent.I did not mind the battery installation being a little difficult since maintenance of your equipment requires you to know how.It did come apart easy enough once you know where to install the thin flat screwdriver to separate the ring from the cup.I like it's ability to compact to take little room in a range bag by folding up like a ball."
1,"I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries. Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out. Other individuals. unfortunately. have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and. if you have a volt checker. test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities."
6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
4,"I enjoyed it but was disappointed that even though i chose 55 minute option cardio- kickbox workout sort of stopped at 30 minutes. she then worked our legs for 5 minutes? Then that other guy did training of some sort that I skipped. then another training....which wasted 10-15 minutes and then there was cool down.  The good thing about this DVD is that you can select to play certain segments....only one segment can be played at a time though. Warm up was good. Good 10 minutes but cardio type with some stretches that I didn't do- I skipped rope instead."
6,"The TrueBlock technology works really well.  I had some folders with old labels that I had written on with Sharpies and ballpoint pen.  I have tried using other labels to cover the old writing. but I could always see through them - especially the labels that I had written on with marker.  These folder labels blocked out the old writing completely.Avery's website also has some really nice free online tools to create quick templates for printing labels - no downloads required.  I used the 'Design and Print Online' feature to create a sheet of labels on my MacBook. then I printed the sheet on my Brother laser printer.  It worked really well.  It took me less than 5 minutes to get my labels typed in. choose a font. and get them printed using the manual sheet feeder on my printer.  It was impressively easy."
5,"Seriously. this is a great pedal. I can't improve upon what others have said. but I will mention a few points.1. I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone. or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. It's run before time based effects (delay. phaser. etc) for me.2. I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster. while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. If it gets noisy or 'self oscillates' after a while. change the battery to a fresh one. Better yet. use an AC adapter.I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews. Otherwise. it's been on my setup for about seven years. I take care of my stuff."
9,"While trigger locks are not intended to make a gun safe (you can still place a round in the chanber of most firearms). They can act and serve as a deterrent to the use of the firearm.  The lock easily attaches to the trigger guard of all firearms.  It is only effective on firearms with fixed trigger guards. I prefer a combination lock because it eliminates the need for keeping a keyring with multiple keys.  I keep and store each of my firearms with one of these combination locks."
10,"This product was a fine addition to my Dewalt compound miter saw. It allowed me to securely place eight foot lengths of crown molding on the cutting table. Amazon shipped mine without the end retaining bolt. but I was in too much of a rush with my project to raise concerns. Besides. not having that bolt did not affect the product's performance. Once again. this was a great addition to my saw.Update:This product sucks! It worked well with flimsy MDF crown molding. but is an absolute waste of time with any real wood. No amount of adjustment will make it support my hardwood projects square against the fence. Save your money and build your own fence and table extension."
9,"Have had this lodge round griddle for years now and it hardly ever leaves the top of the stove.  This is the pan we used to fry eggs. potato slices. grilled cheese. garlic toast. etc. Nothing sticks to it. Wipe clean when you're done. add a touch of oil or bacon grease to season. and it's ready for the next meal.Not too bulky on the stovetop either. Cast iron cooks nice and even and you can get it hot enough to put a nice crust on potatoes and/or whatever type of meat you're cooking.Bought this for my husband to use so he would leave my pans (and not mess them up) alone. I find I use this griddle almost as much as he does! This griddle is well worth purchasing!"
11,"Someone told me about Elf on a Shelf earlier this year knowing how into Christmas I am! This is a wonderful idea for parents who want to create a running dialogue with their kids about Christmas and all that goes into it.The book included with the elf tells the story of how Santa knows whether a child is naughty or nice by sending an elf to their home to report back to him each night. As a parent you can put the Elf somewhere and then your kids can play hide and seek to find him. They can also tell the Elf what they want for Christmas and how they would like Christmas to play out.It is easy to put a faith based element into your play and story as well as any other customs you may want to impart. The Elf makes the anticipation for Christmas more keen and kids enjoy playing hide and seek as well as talking to the Elf."
6,"While address labels may not be the most interesting thing I buy. getting good labels that are easy to print does matter to me.  And the Avery White Easy Peel Return Address Labels 8167 were exactly what I was looking for.They truly are. as advertised. easy to peel off the backing.  And they don't smudge after being printed. nor do they jam in the printer.But for me. perhaps the most important thing about labels is the ease of using the printing website.  I found the Avery site easy to use.The bottom line?  Five stars.  Easy to print and use and economical.  Win win win."
10,"I bought one of these in 1990 (maybe 1989).  I am still using it to this day.If you are looking for a impact driver to for 3/4 bolts then this is not for you.  If you need a reliable cordless screwdriver with enough strength to get the job done with out snapping the heads off your screws and bolts then this is what you want....I use it a lot for assembly / disassembly and it is perfect for the job. and with a chuck adapter light drilling.The only problem I have had was the need to replace battery pack once or twice ( amazon carries themMilwaukee 48-11-0100). but that is acceptable in the course of over a decade of use.note: a drill chuck and a 1/4' socket adapter is a must have addition."
10,"Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However. if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route. and have succeeded."
4,"Well produced script and story of the man we have come to know and respect as one of the great minds of our time! Enjoyable. considering all they tried to pack in from childhood to fairly current times of his life it flowed fairly well. These types of movies tend to be a bit rushed and corny but the writers.cast.director.editor etc. did a great job! I would recommend it as if focus' on his rise to becoming a downright genius of a surgeon etc. and skips his current personal politics so anyone can pick it up and enjoy it!"
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
12,"A very exciting and fun fighting game; Super Smash Bros. is definentally worthy of my approval. In this great multiplayer game you fight opponents using awesome moves and killer items. There are also a variety of levels. each containing their own special dangers. The object of the game is to knock your opponent off the edge of the thing you are fighting on. It could range from a spaceship in the star-e-ness of space to the tops of skyscrapers!Each fighter has their own special moves and abilities to crush other fighters with. Their moves are not hard to learn. so you can get pretty good at the game in a relitively short time.Also. Super Smash Bros. doesn't get boring after you beat it. I've had the game for about three. four years and I still love it. And if you get this AWESOME multiplayer combat game hopefully you will too."
10,"definitely a *major* improvement over not having one.I remember having a bit of a problem getting the screw holes in the hood to line up with those in the planer. but no hig hammers or powertools were required to overcome this minor hassle.The silliness is that you can't flip up the outfeed with the  hood mounted. and unmounting the hood each time isn't rational.  My planer is mounted under a workbench. and I just left plenty of clear and in the back.I'd say this ought to be bundled with the planer - which is a  great planer by the way - this tool produces *volumes* of chips!  some form of dust or chip collection is a requirement. packaging it separately is just a form of gouging.I've never noticed any chip compression pitting as described by another reviewer - either with or without the hood.  btw. I'm using a 5.5hp Sears shop vacuum with it."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
11,"My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be. I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy."
6,"I've long been a fan of Avery products. Every time I buy an off-brand just to save a few cents. I always end up with paper jams or unusable smudged. smeared. or incorrectly placed labels. Avery products are always well-made and supported by every device that I use in my office. The Avery File Folder Labels are no exception.Speaking of software and formats. even if the program you have doesn't support Avery (I can't imagine which one that would be...) you can go to their website and download templates or even use their website to print! (This one is great because our office includes not only PC's but also several Linux machines).Lastly. I was happily surprised to see the inclusion of 2 'Box Tops'. My children's school does an excellent job of collecting these and turning them in. It is nice to finally see these great incentives on products other than snack food.When is a label not just another label? When it's an Avery label! :)"
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (likeBelkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,"This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  We've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.  Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features."
6,"Return address labels save you time. and the Avery system is easier-to-use than many.These labels perform exactly as described. They feed perfectly. are perfectly spaced on the label sheet. are easy to peel and position. and they can be repositioned many times yet still stick firmly.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5267Type in what you want on the labeland Print.The label sheet even shows you which end to insert in your printer.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking return address labels."
2,"I love this little guy!  I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time. and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use. easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher. I think its ok to do so. but from past experience. these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying. so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!"
12,"For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated. but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any"
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"This game is awesome! It's a must have. This game must have the most color in history! It has many levels just like the Original for regular nintendo. Plus it hs a few more opotions. It has a challenge mode which is extremely hard. a Vs mode so you can play your friends. and a &quot;You VS Boo Mode.&quot; It's a very good buy. You'll like it!I got a secret to tell ya too. There are secret levels in this game that are beyond hard! You have to get over 5000000 points in the original mode. If you think about it. it's not so hard to get that many points. It's actually really easy.Well I HIGHLY recommend you buy this album. It's a good buy. well worth your money. and it's fun.Don't forget. this game is for GBC ONLY! That means Game Boy Color."
4,"This is an inspiring movie about Ben Carson. the neurosurgeon who was the first to separate conjoined twins who were connected at the head. This is the story of his life from childhood on and how he (and his brother. as well) received victory over struggling with adversity and anger issues and went on to become successful. He owed his overcoming of trials to God and also his mother who encouraged them to never give up and to know they could do whatever they wanted to do in life. Ben Carson is a very gentle. humble. peaceful man.This is a great movie for youngsters. young adults. and older as well. Very inspirational story for anyone."
9,"Arrived fast. I blew it up to check for holes since we don't plan on using it until this summer. The oars were fairly easy to assemble. The pump is cheap and fell apart easily but we have a nicer one that we use anyway. The kids loved playing in the boat once it was blown up (even if only in the living room). I can't wait to take this to the lake this summer. It's going to be a huge hit with the kids. Deflated easily for storage."
1,"I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out. the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as 'build quality: poor. life span: short. effectiveness: disappointing'."
10,"To be honest. even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years. I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers. the last thing I need was another router. so instead. I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable. very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base. it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes. to a predetermined depth with each pass. simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it."
12,"I've played this game many. many times. But unfortunately. it's one of those games that you will either love or hate. which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly. gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun. especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans. but like I said. don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do. some don't. Simple as that"
1,"In an urgent need to fix badly cracked/chapped lips I turned to Amazon to find a lip balm.I first tried outBurt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube. .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)only to end up with no improvement after 3 or so days. Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them. not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me. not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection. but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips."
4,"&quot;George Lucas in Love&quot; is the funniest eight minute short movie that I have ever seen.  What if George Lucas. the creator of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. had a muse. like &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; suggests that the Bard did?  Well. imagine George Lucas living in a dorm at USC. struggling to create a short picture.  And then the fun begins.  This short is laden with layer after layer of inside jokes.  I've watched it over a dozen times. and each time I see another joke that I missed before."
10,"I use this cordless screwdriver at work as a HVAC/refrigeration tech. It works okay. Not as strong as I expected and the battery does not last as long as I expected. I had a Craftsman cordless (made by Black & Decker) before. The battery on that one would last a week with frequent use. this one only lasts a day or two. Maybe there is a better battery available. haven't checked. The old one was more for home use so it did break after just a year or so with what I use it for. this one has a 5 year warranty which is good."
10,"I have owned the DeWalt vertical clamp for about a year now. and it works well on my DW703 compound miter saw.  It is a bit large and clunky. and your finger can get slightly pinched by the release button. but the clamp is solidly built and holds tight every time.  If there is a fault. it's with the miter saw itself.  The holes for the clamp post in the saw's base could be placed better. and the saw wasn't designed with other clamping methods in mind.  In many instances. the DeWalt clamp is the only possible way to hold the work piece in place."
5,"I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way. once plugged in. it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar. a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good. if not better.  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole. this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar."
7,"This is the 2nd roll I've purchased. so that should tell you how much I like it.  I got a 50' roll first. and liked it enough to buy another 25' roll so I would have enough and some extra to cover all my yard.This is the first hose I've used/owned that you didn't have to be super careful not to kink.  It always seemed like the higher end the hose was. the softer it was. and the more it would kink on me.  I can just roll/unroll this hose when I need it. and no issues so far.  Highly recommended."
6,"I needed more space for 'digital devices'. I have a laser printer and needed a place to put the office scanner I just purchased. This fits perfectly on top of the printer without making the printer unusable. The paper comes out of the printer and the scanner sits right on top of this awesome device.The stand is metal and very sturdy. It can easily hold an old CRT monitor... though. who even has one nowadays?It is marketed as a monitor stand. but you can (obviously) use it wherever you want and put whatever you want on it."
11,"I saw this game on the cover of a magazine. and in several stores. and it was all the awards it received that got my attention. I needed a game that me and my husband could play with our kids. (ages 6 and 14). That is not an easy task to find a game for such a broad spectrum of ages. We usually stick with Uno. But this looked promising. so we picked it up. We played it wrong the first couple of times. but with each play we figured out the rules better. (it is not one that you can just skim over the rules and 'get it' right away. But once you do 'get it' it is super simple.) It kind of works like Uno crossed with the strategy of Scrabble. We love it."
10,"Stanley has been making planes for a long time. They do know what they are  doing. I have a few of these around for general purpose work . I also have  some Lie Nielsons and I love them but I keep them safe and out of reach of  others'. I don't care who uses the Stanleys. I know if they get ruined .  I'm not out much. With a little tuning a stanley will do a respectable job.  Lap the sole and the iron .put a good bevel on it and it will cut  aggressively or produce a fine shaving. The adjustable throat is a must for  avoiding tearout. I like the low angle version of this plane a little  better. It is easier to control .It also makes a finer cut. It won't cut as  deep however. To get a better plane you will have to spend at least twice  as much so this is not a bad deal."
12,"Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 and does not own Mario Kart should just throw it away.This is a classic N64 game that's a ton of funeven today where there are games with better graphics.The point of the game is simple: win the race by any means.There are no plot twists. no complicated storylines.It has all the classic Mario characters includingMario. Luigi. Peach. Bowser. Wario. Toad. Yoshi and others.Once you finish everything. there is a bonus optionwhere you can play all levels again but backwards!Seriously. this game is an awesome classicand a great addition to any and all N64 game collections.Overall.5/5"
6,"Great product we used it mount all our travel photos above are bed. One helpful hint. be sure to allow the paint to cure for a few weeks. so that it doesn't lifts off easily. Also. we found it worked best when you prime the walls before you paint it makes a difference when using mounting tape. The paint and texture don't come off so easily when you take the tape off later--which is great. We change out the photos every few months when we go on another trip. We have some photos that have been up for over a year and there is no lift in the corners like you see with other mounting two side tape."
6,"I have routinely spent a lot of money on nice. colorful gift wrap and then. when I get the gift wrapped all that seems to stand out is the tape that is used to seal the package.  This gift wrap tape actually becomes invisable on the package and lets your gift wrap show through.  It doesn't cost much more to make your gift wrapping look really professional.  I used this tape on both a solid blue colored wrap and a mulit-colored paper and it worked great on both.  It was also invisable where I used the tape to attach the little envelope with the gift tag and note.  I recommend this tape and will probably end up using it for more than just gift wrapping.. it's a very nice tape for everyday use as well."
10,"Check your blades. This goes for all brands of planers. The dullness factor creeps in ever so slowly and you may not be aware that your blades are too dull. I felt the old blades and they seemed sharp. but the normally fairly quiet Makita seemed too loud and the boards were not sliding smoothly through.The new blades were obviously much sharper and things went back to normal once installed. The Amazon price was the lowest I saw and they arrived quickly. although strangely packed in a big torn-up box.So. don't be cheap. Be proactive and replace those blades. You spent a lot of money on the machine. so keep it working well. Same goes for bandsaw blades (same basic experience). saw blades. etc. It is an expensive hobby for some and a business expense that can't be circumvented for others."
12,"This game rocks the most. Quite possibly the best racing game for the N64. Beetle Adventure Racing packs so much into a single game pak that you wonder just what exactly does go on inside of that cartridge. Unlike other N64 racing games. BAR look just as darn good as anything you'd find on many Dreamcast games. The graphics are lush. Plus. there's stuff going on off of the track. Trains go by. warehouses operate and some freaky looking pumpkin things dance around. It offers much more to look at than. say. any Crusin' title. The control is superb. even the poor handling cars are a blast to play with. There's a Goldeneye multiplayer rip off where your car is outfitted with missles and bombs and the such. you get to go around collecting beetles which is just an excuse to kick the living daylights out of your annoying kid brother. Not that we :cough: ever do that."
10,"Everyone loves this saw. or so it seems from the reviews.  I like this saw as well. I own it.  I've had it for over a year and a half and I've cut everything from 1x4s to 6x6s. mostly for framing.  I still think it lacks power compared to a worm drive. which isn't all that much more expensive.  Here's what I'd like you to consider before buy a circular saw: try out a worm drive before buying anything. Brakes are a definate plus. for you don't want to slow down when you're on a roll and they make for a downright safer cut.  Also consider the $60 Skil 13amp saw with a laser.  Skil is a great name when it comes to circular saws. and what a great price.  If you want to spend more look at the Skil worm drive saw.  If you want to buy milwaukee. buy the version of this circular saw with a brake. you'll thank yourself later."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
6,"Getting divider labels to look good has been one of my challenges. If you need dividers for presentations or just to look good it's almost impossible to get most labels to print out with the right alignment. Others I've tried I had to waste a whole sheet to get a couple of labels printed.These clear labels with the templates worked fantastic. The templates. printing. and results were flawless. The dividers themselves are tough. reinforced. bright white. and very crisp. I make binders and presentation materials that I can be proud of - and for my sales efforts help me win by being a notch better than my competitors. One of the few products that I use consistently and would not think of changing from."
9,"Bought this air mattress for camping out with the kids. Used it a couple times. with several different size people (child to large adult). everyone seemed to find it comfortable.  I like the fabric surface. still want to try it with only a blanket underneath and cover.  I have difficulty lying in one spot. this is an issue for this mattress. as it's not wide enough to roll over. etc.  Overall. I found the mattress a good value.Pros:PriceSurface material (not all vinyl)Length is very good. I'm 5' 10&#34;. plenty of room leftCan handle a heavy person (230 lb) without hitting groundCons:Width - which is obvious from looking at it online"
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
2,"The metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends. Although it worked well as a muffin disher. it deformed and popped out the first time I tried to scoop ice cream from a batch I made that was frozen just a bit over soft serve (I would never use ANY sweeper scoop - even well-made ones like theNorpro 3-Tablespoon Stainless Steel Scoop- to dish ice cream any harder than that). Waste of money. Look elsewhere.And for dishing ice cream only. of any degree of hardness. try theZeroll Original 3-Ounce Aluminum Ice Cream Scoop."
6,"The cart is well made. craftsmanship. assembly. etc. no complaints.My only gripe is that the shelves are (to me) up-side-down.  I dont want the 'lip' on the shelf pointing upwards.  Most of my wire shelves have the lip pointing down at the front tip of the shelf.  This makes it more convenient to pull out larger jugs off the shelf.  I suppose some can argue that the jugs could slip off while one moves the cart. so it is better to have the lip pointing up.99% of the time the cart is stationary for me.  only a few times a year I would move it out of the utility room to make more room for carrying bulky things through the utility room.  That said. I would rather have at least the top and center shelves to have the lip pointing down."
11,"Elder sign by Fantasy Flight Games is a really fun game! The artwork is well designed and the game requires a few minutes of easy set up but can be played anywhere due to the lack of a board. The rules are easy to follow. and if you can roll dice you can play Elder Sign. Each game is unique which is why we love it so much. The collection of &#34;missions&#34; allows you to play a new game each time you take it out of the box which gives this game some longevity as far as playability in the long run. One of the other nice things is you can play it alone. or with several others. It makes for a great family game with anyone from i'd say age 12 and up. Great and affordable way to start your game nights too!"
1,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers. which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer. they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's. not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I'd try a Norelco or Remington. but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic."
12,"The original Mario Kart for the SNES was fun. and a good effort for the limited capabilities of the SNES platform. Mario Kart 64 made full use of the N64's 3-D capabilities. making for a very fun and successful game. Up to four players can engage in the game. and the racecourses are as colorful and rich as they are varied. Each character has their own racecourse (Peach's castle. Bowser's castle. Yoshi's canyons. Donkey Kong's jungle. and so on and so forth) plus more that are just fun and varied. like a beach. the desert. snowfields. and the Rainbow Road.You can play against the computer and compete for various cups. and each set of courses has various levels of difficulty. You get cool items to aid your progress on the track (or hinder the progress of others) There is also a VS mode where two to four players can battle against one another. Overall this is a really great game for the Nintendo 64."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
7,"I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient.  After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping. we just felt that it didn't cut it.  We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them. so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time).  Also. I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes.  The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges.  The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves.  I cannot speak for the weedwacker. as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it."
11,"Ticket to Ride is the board game I most often reach for when I have family visiting. For the middle-school aged nephews and the 'hard to teach an old dog new tricks' crowd. Ticket to Ride is very easy to pick up on the rules.And those rules? They can be boiled down to 'It's like Gin Rummy ... with little plastic trains'. Collect cards of matching color sets. then use those sets to claim your tracks to connect cities into a grand network. But watch out for your fellow railbarons. who might have designs for that Los Angeles to El Paso route!Even though I also play quite complex and multi-layered board games. I've never not had fun with Ticket to Ride. It plays quickly. and even the slowest to learn players pick up on how to do well in just a couple rounds."
7,"I cut down two very dead shrubs today using these and was very impressed with these lightweight loppers.  I didn't think I'd get the heavier two-inch branches cut because these loppers are so light. but with the right grip the gear holds the wood down and cuts the branch cleanly in half with little effort.  I'm not the strongest person out there and I'm certainly no Hercules. but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively. once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy.  And. since they are somewhat long. you can also reach up rather high.  Overall. a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it. and look impressive in my tool corner."
12,"The N64 had its share of ups and downs. but when it hit up. boy does it hit it. This is the ultimate party game. Invite some friends over. order a pizza. and watch the mayhem unfold. The controls and graphics have aged well. with the colors remaining bright and colorful and the moves still being easy to pull off.The one downside is that the single player mode hasn't aged as well. Unlocking the four hidden characters is pretty simplistic. though it's hard to fault a 14ish year old game for that. This is a fantastic buy for anyone who wants to start up their collection of N64 games or for anyone looking for a great party experience"
2,"this is my 3rd Eureka Quick Pick Up cordless sweeper. They are great for picking up cat and dog hair and light floor cleaning. I use it daily as I have 2 inside cats.. I would not recommend it for heavy duty carpet cleaning as it is not powerful enough to do a thorough job.It's easy to clean the filter cup but is a little dirty to do so. Just empty the filter cup. rinse it out and the container and allow it to dry before placing on the sweeper.I am pleased it has an extra battery. The previous two did not.If you want a light weight easy to use cordless sweeper. you won't be disappointed"
7,"The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width. length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive. just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway."
11,"PROS: Easy game to learn. Educational for US. Geography. Moderate luck factor.CONS: Not recommended for avid game players. Only moderate strategy.Ticket to ride is fun. it's got some strategy to it. but I've played better. In fact. the European version adds a few more variants that greatly improve on the game. I would recommend this game for beginners. For highly competitive game board fanatics. one or two plays of this version and you'll move on. Best just to skip to the European version."
4,"I can't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches. Frankly. I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets. If anything. it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen. If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion. I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread. Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness. but you won't find them in this sick piece of trash."
10,"Recently took advantage of a Porter Cable combo set--buy their biscuit joiner and get their 1 3/4 HP classic router free. Good buy. Had one of these routers years ago. gave it to my son and have missed it ever since. Problem is it came with a standard two-handled base. Outfitted the router with this D-handle-- which offers great control. Only problem is the router  has a long cord which has to be bundled up when using the D-handle to keep the cord out of the way. Pricey but worth it."
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
9,"After a traumatic experience with my old knife (also Swiss Army) that involved an impossible to open wine bottle. I was in need of a new knife.  I searched and searched with the following requirements.  It had to have both a small and large blade.  It needed a phillips and flat screwdriver.  It also needed the punch. toothpick. and tweezers.  I found what I needed in the tinker.  Its two blades wide. and the length in the description is accurate. no extra bulges in my pocket.  I can easily say that i use it 4-5 times a day."
2,"I use the TN311C heavy-duty grounded timer to control the ON-OFF cycle of a dehumidifier.  I actually bought two units - the 2nd one as a back-up - and. removed all of the 'ON' and 'OFF' trippers from the back-up unit to use on this one.  This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles. and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.  I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.  It keeps our area perfectly dehumidified. and the humidity rise is only 4% to 5% during the OFF cycle.I would recommend this timer to anyone considering a use similar to mine."
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
10,"This is by far the best router that I have used. and I've used them all! It is incredibly powerful. quiet. well designed. easy to handle. and light. The soft start feature is a huge plus. The variable speed is very helpful. Heck of a deal for the money.I use this tool with the Bosch Deluxe edge guide to make trim and moulding. No question this is professional level tool that great for homeowner and contrator.I love this thing!  I have yet to find something I don't like."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
4,"Master.Things are going very smoothly. Undoubtedly.Emmerich's pervasive presence has allowed meto persevere on the set; it's the same spiritualforce I believe that will catapult this film to thetop of the box office. In my ponderings. I can'thelp but wonder if these same forces are what aidedher in her levitating and astral projecting. Itake devilsh delight in believing so.If you would kindly send me another copy of 'TheDolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ' I wouldbe indebted to you. Unfortunately. my copy wascovered in blood.

1,"This product contains way too much sugar for me.

Benefiber is a little more expensive. but at least I'm not paying for sugar and putting on weight from the empty calories.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
4,"This movie is more like a propaganda film. None of us will ever know for sure about the historical Jesus. since he lives more in myths and beliefs than in historical chronicle. How did Mr Gibson know about the level of cruelty shown? Moreover. Jesus was depicted more like the conventional iconography--caucasian male with a beard and long hair. How did a hard working carpenter look in 2000 yrs old Middle East? Certainly not like the one shown.However. this movie did one good thing for me: reminded me about the necessity to cultivate compassion for fellow human beings. On the other hand. for the simple-minded. literal believer. this movie will generate hate. vengeance. and totally undeserving surge of emotion.From that standpoint. I must say. this movie fell short as a visual art.Watch it. but please 'watch out' about what you feel."
10,"I'm using this on cedar furniture to get it super smooth and it works great. The paper is a bit thin so it can sometimes fold and crease when sanding across slats but I've sanded several chairs and tables and outside of the first sheet folding because I wasn't paying attention they have performed flawlessly. Plus. They seem to last quite a long time and I've barely dented the box; one sheet will easily last me about three chairs (these are large. deep-seated slat chairs) or 2 tables each. For comparison I go through about one sheet of 120 grit per chair and 1.5 sheets of 120 per table. I will buy these again and again. when I run out in a few years."
4,"When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television. at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries. I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.This film. though. is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!"
1,"My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I don't give 5 stars because I don't see it as a &#34;must have&#34; or &#34;must buy&#34; which I consider a 5 star rating to be."
10,"I really like my DeWalt sliding compound miter saw. and got this bag for it when I started using the saw in my garage shop (as opposed to outdoors projects) for dust control. It is only a little bit better than using the saw without it. I would say the dust capture is 20% at best.I found that I am a lot better off for dust capture if I attach my shop vacuum to the port where this bag is supposed to attach and have active suction to pick up the dust. This captures about half or more of the dust. Overall. though. it seems that there is a reason there are dust hood systems with large hoods to capture miter saw dust into a collector: a lot of the dust does not exit through the blade guard. but spews right off the top of the cut.Conclusion: don't bother with this. it's not good value and it gets in the way."
10,"Although I had to drill holes to fit my Craftsman drill press. the basic setup was reasonably easy.  The result was a very sturdy little stand -- perfect for many bench top tools.  Its weight and construction make for a very stable base.  Comparing it to. for example. a similar stand (sold by the same store from which I bought the drill press.) there is simply no comparison to be made.  This Delta stand is far superior.  I will probably buy another soon for my bench grinder."
4,"Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can.t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has &#34;sold&#34;.  Soon &#34;ghosts&#34;- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past. present. and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his &#34;value system&#34; .  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!"
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
1,"ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging. but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright. and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier. MyBatterySupplier. I ordered the50-pack. which did come in the new hologram package. and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant. and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars."
5,"been using these cables for three months now. I use them with aZoom G1N Guitar Multi Effects Pedaland they sound great. decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research I found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time. they have a good lenght. of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues you'll be playing. so far I've only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig I've got coming up the end of the month."
4,"I learned a lot about our nation's history that simply isn't taught in our classrooms anymore.  David Barton lays out the facts.  This is the History of our nation in the words of the men who made the history.  The recent textbook battle in Texas was largely over this issue: getting the real history of our nation back into the history books.  I can understand why people with a certain political agenda wouldn't want this information out there. but if you want the whole truth and not the current edited version of history that is being taught in so many of our classrooms today. this is for you."
7,"I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives. they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway. I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it. then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet. ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again. still upside down. and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap."
10,"I have owned ny DeWalt for about eight months. Sometimes the on/off switch gets caught but really no trouble. I have probably put close to 500 hours of heavy duty work with this. C &amp; D side plywood. raw wood as well as refinishing. I just had to replace the pad today as it losts its grip on the sandpaper. But again a very minor problem. My sole major problem is how hot the handle gets after about two hours of consistent sanding. However. the finish is beautiful and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,"It's a good sturdy brush. bends well. fits in what I need it for. but the bristles are only slightly rougher than a generic bottle brush. I use it clean glass bottles I fill with juice (from a juicer). and it doesn't get anything stuck on. It also stains easy. However. the grip is comfortable and it's a good length for 16oz glass bottles. and if you can find a different way to get things unstuck. it works just fine. I just wish it was rougher and a little longer wouldn't hurt. It does the job but aside from real sturdiness it's not much better than a generic brush."
9,"Canon makes the best stuff and now these are my favorite Binoculars. They work GREAT! I always see a lot of unsteadiness when I hold a pair of Binoculars for any period of time while zooming in as far as possible. These though have a button on them which engages a gyroscope (That's what the documentation says) of some sort and totally steadied the image. I walked around using them and they work GREAT! I have yet to try them aboard and boat of from a moving land vehicle. but as the Documentation also states there are apt to be problems with that sort of use. I totally recommend these as being Fantastic Binoculars. Canon always seems to cos more than other devices. I also own a few of their Cameras and Lenses. but you get what you pay for. I have come to like Canon products very much and plan on using their products in the future."
10,"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10' Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw. model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw. however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket. and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on. it works fine."
12,"This was a very addictive game. with lots of fun involved. When I first saw this game. I thought it would reek. because the fighting scenes aren't great. But this game is a lot more than just fighting. it's an awesome RPG. maybe one of the best. Some of the bad language is not needed. but it's easy to look past that.One thing that really bugged me was that in some parts it was just too hard. and you could walk around for hours and not figure out what you were supposed to do. But other than that it was great.  You can actually play arcade games inside this game. and there is even a place where you can shoot some hoops! There is a big mix inside this. you can drive a motorcycle. a chocobo :}. and some hover crafts. This game is really fun. and has I think about 50 hours of gameplay on three different discs. so go out and get yours today!Jesse"
10,"Fact is I need this thing. It fits my PC circular saw great. It's very light weight and long enough to not get in the way when ripping sheet goods. I have it connected to my shop vac and it does a good job collecting the stuff that would otherwise be flying through the air. But step back for a minute. It's just a plastic hose. The same stuff you can by a HD for 50 cents a foot. Ah. but the stuff at HD is not the right diameter. Gotcha. Man I wish some of this dust collection stuff would be more standard. PC is a 1&quot; end. my miter saw is 2&quot;. my vacuum accessories are 1 1/4. my band saw is 2 1/2. You get the picture. I've got a drawer full of adapters. This fits the bill but they know you can't go out and buy it elsewhere. Shame."
11,"My 3 year old grandaughter absolutely loves puzzles and is quite good at putting them together.  When I gave her this Jumbo Puzzle to work on she quickly put it together as well.  The one thing that frustrated her was we put it together on the carpet and it wasn't flat enough.  I think she didn't think she was doing it correctly when it didn't seem to snap together easily.  I would recommend putting this together on a smooth surface. large table. wood floor.  Other than that one frustration. my grandaughter loved it.  It has a little handle on the box. so the puzzle pieces can be neatly stored away and the child can carry the box."
5,"I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58. but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
4,"This is a very basic cooking dvd. which I think is good for everyone. even if it's just a review.  I don't consider myself a novice cook. but I even got some techniques and tips from it.  I think just being in the presence of Julia is a good thing. like her teaching continues even though she is still not with us.The quality of my dvd's are just fine. not sure why that other reviewer had issues with the quality.  I wish Julia had done a series of vidoes.  Now you can only get a few of the old episodes of her French Chef cooking show.  Guess they didn't think of it back then.This is a great video for beginners and I think a great price. under $11."
12,"The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it. The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult. It takes some getting used to. The image was very dark. not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem. The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this. The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together. Overall i was not happy with the game itself. I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product."
11,"So. this is a star wars game. if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game. that is pretty much it.  You roll dice. move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah. save your money and get King of Tokyo instead. if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
4,"G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen!  Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!"
6,"I have had my epson 2200 for ten years now. and it is still going strong. Yes. it uses a lot of ink. and yes. the ink is expensive. but the results are well worth it. I find it works better if it is used often.This is not a printer for the timid. However. if you are willing to spend the time learning about the color management. and calibrations. the unit delivers spectacular prints.I am particularly impressed with the print quality from this machine. I use the velvet fine art paper. and find the prints are extremely stable. and the colors do not fade or shift."
7,"In the past I've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores.  That was a mistake.  After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product. I decided to give it a try.  Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on. it isn't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments.  After I tried one of these. I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses."
11,"This peg toy allows my 2 year old grandsons to use new skills. They have to work hard to master putting the peg into the mat. The mat needs to be thicker which would make it easier for them and also keep the mat from warping so that the mat will lie flat. Overall. it is a great toy that could be tweaked in this way to be even better! I think they will play with this for several more years as they get better at stacking the pegs or creating designs. Great concept!"
2,"I saw all the warnings about this item not being dishwasher safe. I saw the sticker on the flat side of the mallet. Good to go. as I hand wash my dishes. After having used the thing and cleaned it right after I was done. one evening when I was tired I simply I tossed it in with the few dishes and utensils soaking in hot water. Big mistake. After that. this thing was ruined. It should have been obvious. Why would something not be dishwasher safe? The high temperatures. of course. I knew not to put it in the dishwasher. but I did not want chicken juice getting crusted on the thing and so I put it in with everything else to hand wash.Simple mistake. Cost me $15. Save yourself the trouble and try to find something that is stainless steel."
5,"Without changing my pickups or polishing my frets. I thought I'd try to get a little more sustain switching up strings. At first I thought I had got a bum buy because the I had to bring the action up a bit to account for the over brightness of the strings. Had my tone all off and I was ready to dig my other set back out of the trash..... played on it for a half hour (went through the exact same thing with the Polywebs I put on the RG655) then retuned. sounded pretty good. Played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now. Dropped the action back down and it's smooth as silk in an hour's time. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
10,"My local big box store sold me this bulb for my Porter Cable 18v Lithium Flashlight (model PCL-180FL). After about one half hour of continuous use the flashlight stopped working.  Upon opening up the lens holder I discovered the bulb had melted through the bulb holder.  Fortunately. the Porter Cable service rep took pity on me and is mailing me replacement parts so I can fix my flashlight. None the less. before buying this bulb. make sure it is truly compatible with your flashlight or you may end up destroying your flashlight.  The correct bulb for the Porter Cable 18v series of flashlights (e.g. PCL-180FL and PCL-18FL) is a KPR 18v 0.3amp krypton bulb(Porter Cable part number #90534275).Ultimately what Porter Cable/Dewalt (they are the same company) need to do is release an LED conversion kit for their flashlights."
10,"I looked at several competitive products and chose this one.  This is a very good tool.  It is easy to handle as it is light. yet powerful. and the trigger is large.  These features give you good control esp with larger screws.  I have driven up to 3 inch screws with ease.  The nosecone takes some practice to adjust. but once you figure it out. it performs very nicely.  My only complaint is that the instructions provided are kind of sparse and you end up figuring out how to use the tool by yourself.  Not a big issue. however. as the tool is very simple.Overall. very satisfied!!"
6,"I recently testedScotch Magic(TM) Tape 3105. 3/4-inch x 300 Inches. 3-Packagainst Scotch's(R) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape.  Both were both 3/4 inches wide.You can't go wrong with either of these products!  They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy. and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side. you'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape.  Either way. find the best price. keep it simple. and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed!"
6,"These do. in fact. perform as advertised.  They run through my laser printer cleanly and adhere well. blocking things underneath (I tested it on a white box that had black sharpie on it; the sharpie was obscured by the label 100%).  They are a bit small for my box-shipping needs (I use the half-sheet labels for that) but for mailing correspondence to the same address every month. it's quite easy to run off the addresses on a sheet of these labels and keep them with my stamps."
11,"We got one of these games on the recommendations on Amazon.  We were not disappointed. it is fun. quick to learn. and can be played with children as well as adults.  I tried it on all of them from grand kids to married and college kids and my husband and I alone.  It was fun in every instance.  We then bought 13 games for Christmas presents for friends and families confident that it would be an addition to good times together.  Recommend it as well as Spot It. both new games we tried this year."
1,"I love Certain Dri. I'm not sure I could get along in life without it. When I first started using Certain Dri over a decade ago. I would use it every day. Then. I dropped down to using it every other day after maybe two or three weeks. Now. I feel I only need to give my underarms a few swipes once a week. This is incredible because I used to sweat like a beast. I mean. just sitting down without moving around would make my underarms sweat profusely. Gross. I don't worry about that anymore. I do wish that the product worked on hands. though. I haven't had any success trying to get it to work on my hands. However. that's not how the product is marketed. It is just wishful thinking."
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
7,"I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim. so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes. it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself. but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort."
11,"A fun. fast and easy to learn card game with high replayability!  Every time you play Fluxx it changes.  The cards change.  The goals change.  The game can end in one play or 40 minutes later. this is what makes it so fun. or frustrating!  The Zombies are the Creepers in this version of Fluxx. and there are certain cards that can also turn your friends (Keepers) into zombies as well.  Other cards can undo that. as well as make the Goals (which most say you cannot win with Zombies) allow you to be able to win with zombies.  There are a lot of fun elements with this version and it does combine with most other Fluxxes (although not Martian. which I just purchased and found out).  I love everything Zombie so this one gets played a LOT with our various gaming groups!  Highly recommended!"
6,"The high quality of Avery products is once again found in these Easy Peel Return Address Labels for use with ink jet printers.The labels peel off easily and quickly with only a slight flexion of the carrier sheet material.  In fact. due to the design. flexion of the carrier sheet is really no longer necessary.The fast. easy peel feature is achieved by stripping off the extra surrounding waste label paper that is between the labels.  This leaves the labels as free-standing units on the carrier sheet.For anyone who has ever had to put labels on a number of letters. this saves substantial time and mess.  Other brands really have some catching up to do!"
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play. but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game"
2,"Probably best vaccuum I have ever owned. I only ever buy stand up vacuums but this one had great reviews and I thought. what the heck. It is really light. I hardly ever notice it trailing along behind me. and it has a really good suction! I love the long hose and different attachments. Whereas I used to just vacuum my rugs. now my cleaning routine consists of me vacuuming everything in my house. I mean everything. Lol. It goes from hardwood to carpet easily. the bags last a long time. There are 2 cons on this product in my opinion. 1) the cord does not retract. and 2) the hose is somewhat thin and occasionally kinks. It does seem the hose won't last long but I can't imagine it is much to replace."
5,"I tend to sweat when I play. so coated strings are a necessity for me.  These are as good as any coated string on the market. I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings.  Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string. These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well.  Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play!  Oh. and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them.  The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it."
9,"Got it today. way quicker than I expected or was said. it's so cute. it's tiny. got it as a gift for my fathers b-day who has all mac stuff. laptop. phone and think ipod. so this goes along with his style. didn't take it out of the box so as not to finger print it up. though it is really cute and think he will like it.  Has toothpick and tweezers.  Assuming like my old faithful swiss is sharp as can be though won't find out till he gets it."
4,"Nowdays.most Americans do not know who Stalin or even Hitler was(but they know 50 cent). so this movie would confuse most in the USA. Hitler and Stalin were both Communists and were basically on the same team. Marx called for the elimination of 'Trash Races' like the Lithuanians. Poles. Britons. etc. He said those races were too backward to be revolutionary ! So much for all of you 'Useful Idiot' commies. George Bernard Shaw is on the video calling for the development of a poison that would be humane and kill rapidly ( Zyklon B). A lot of information that would not be aired in the USA as it caused a big furor in Europe.The same Blood bankers that created communism then are still running London and Washington and this movie alludes to that."
10,"I am a remodeler. I am not committed to any brand of tools. Some brands do better on one tool. and some do better on another. Overall Milwaukee is the brand I use the most. but a drywall screwgun I went with DeWalt. I have no complaints with this gun. It is fast. powerful. light. and has easy depth adjustment. I have been using it for the last year+ and havent had any problems with it.If you have drywall to do. and you dont have a drywall gun you are wasting time. It is worth the money."
12,"Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but. every level get's harder and harder it's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50% of your muscles would atrophy. also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let's make a cake for mario then it's over so don't waste your time with this game."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
7,"This is very heavily built and well designed.  For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly. and can hold 6 large burgers easily.  You can adjust the grill height to two positions. So far I've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking.  It's is easy to clean (set it on the grass and hose it out).  The bottom grating is showing signs of rust. so I've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out.  However. it is so stout that I don't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time."
5,"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake. to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4' stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels. and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake. and instead of buying another snake. why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup. no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4' stereo... It's high quality. and very solid. I definately expect this to last me a long time."
2,"Every chef says the best mashed potatoes are made with a ricer so I treated myself to this one.  I found the handles a little uncomfortable...silicone or rubber on them might help.  Pressing the potato through isn't as easy as chefs make it look but I found if I put the bowl in the sink and then leaned the lower handle on the sink and pressed down. it was much easier and kind of fun.The potatoes came through very fluffy but really once you add the milk and butter. they become creamy so I don't know about this 'fluffy mashed potatoes' I keep reading about.  But using the ricer is much more consistent than mashing...not a chance of lumps so they're very very smooth.  I'd definitely recommend this product."
5,"These strings are best suited for Strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone. They're also quite good on Les Paul style guitars if you like slinky strings. My issue with them is that the B string and the A string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others. I would prefer if the B string were 0.012 instead of 0.0115 and if the A were 0.032 instead of 0.034. As such. I prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way. But if you're not too picky. this will suit you very well."
5,"This Guitar Hanger is good looking. well made. and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room. Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet. and so far that seems to be the case.The hanger was easy to install (literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall) and is easy to use (just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck).Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"The movie is very vivid and emotional. I don't like to watch violence. but I think in this case it shows exactly what our Savior went through so that we can have salvation. It adds meaning to it. It's very difficult to watch because of how awful they were to Him. but it depicts the love of God for us. thus strengthening our love for Him. He made that ultimate sacrifice for us. so now it's our turn to make our sacrifices for Him. even unto death."
9,"If it's 20lb test. SAY that it's 20lb test.  Don't do the '20/8lb' nonsense.  It means it's 20lb test with the same diameter as 'normal' 8lb test monofiliment.  What's up with that?  When did fishing become a techno-weenie adventure?Not at all what I wanted.I'm dropping the staars for a very confusing product description.  I can't use it on my reels. and can't rate it as a fishing line. but the guy I gave it to was very happy to get it for salmon fishing."
12,"Alright already. It's a great game. Good AI. graphics. Runs well. Atmospheric. Great story and dialogue. Comedy. Blah. blah. blah.Wait a minute. I got a complaint! That movie in the beginning. You can't escape  it. It just goes on and on babbling while you're stuck in a stupid tram  car. Sheesh. What a bore. That kind of nonsense will cost you a star.  Later. I went thru that ride a few times because I grew to like the eerie  understated music. Still. I think I should have been able to skip the intro  movie. Ruined the whole game for me."
6,"I ordered i think 4 70-sheet notebook spirals. and 2 100-sheet sprials from this company that sent me the wrong items from SAM'S club?? But I didnt return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls? because 1. I didnt feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2. So that i wouldn't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it's okay that my order got wrong. I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened... They are nice notebooks though. Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot (which I don't unless its a math or number involved class)I like them."
6,"I purchased 2 of these for my recent cross-country move to protect my kitchen-wares and fragile stuff (e.g. lamps. picture frames. a porcelain owl. etc.).  I did not lose any dishes. cups. bowls. and other fragile items during the move I'm sure in part thanks to the Scotch Cushion Wrap.  The perforations 12 inches help make it easy to tear proper lengths of bubble wrap and you can easily fold or stack them back up for re-use.  I have no complaints and will probably buy again for my next move."
9,"I have a saying.  'Give me your dullest knives. and I'll make them duller!'  I stink at sharpening knives.  Always have.  But since I purchased the DMT I've been able to keep all my blades in shaving sharp condition.  It does the job fast. and thats cool. because I can be impatient.  I have found that the fine side does most of the sharpening. and is adequate for most needs.  The lite. small. compactness of it makes it great for any trip where regular sharpening is required. ie. camping fishing. backpacking.  So for all you unskilled types (like me). you will be happy buying the DMT diafold sharpener."
12,"The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean. what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat. and have hardly any detail. and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns. well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking. but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking. the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal. but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
2,"I have heard for quite some time how wonderful Potato Ricers are. They process the Potato in one squeeze. and prevent over mixing and creating glue when using a stand mixer. I decided to see for myself if I preferred riced potatoes. The first time I used the OXO Ricer. the Potatoes came out creamy and delicious. The texture was different than whipped Potatoes. and the flavor was more &#34;natural&#34;. I didn't need to stir in as much butter or cream as I usually would when I used the stand mixer. I now use the Ricer every time I make Mashed Potatoes. and really enjoy this new method. The OXO Ricer is easy to use. easy to clean. and the padded grips prevent hand cramping if you are processing a larger batch. - Highly recommended."
7,"I bought this thing when they still had the wooden handles.  Being an avid sewer. I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many. many years.  So. when I saw these at the local garden store. it was a no brainer in my mind.  SO glad I have these!  Of ALL the tools like this I've owned over the years. this set of Loppers from Fiskars is the only set that hasn't broken. become jammed. or some other weird thing.  I clean them after each use to keep diseases spreading from plant to plant.  They're amazingly easy to use. especially for women. and boy. the clean cuts it makes just makes everything you do a breeze.  One of those items I am SO glad I found!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
9,"This is really an excellent accessory to improved dumbbell training at Home. or you can even bring then to the gym.The power hooks provides the user with a method to perform and accomplish heavier dumbbell training procedures safer and easier. resulting in maximum training benefits from your pair of dumbbells. reducing the risk of injury when handling heavy weights.Each power hook comes with a leather strap that attaches the power hook to the dumbbell bar. This way for example you can position your loaded dumbbells in the overhead barbell. lay in the bench. and grab the dumbbells that are already positioned in a convenient way to perform presses or flies without the risk of injuring yourself when to try to take the heavy dumbbells from the flour to the starting position for a dumbbell bench press or fly.I bought mines about six months ago. and I love them. They allow me to handle heavy weights safely when there no one near to help you with the weights. This is even more convenient if you train alone at home."
9,"Each year. I give these little classic knives as gifts to an assortment of people.  With the restrictions on knives on aircraft now. they are always appreciated.  Since owning and using these on a daily basis for many years. I have yet to have one break or be problematic.  I do oil the hinges every year or so at least. more when the knife is used often.  It's the most basic knife without bells and whistles and I love it.  They are offered in a wide variety of colors and patterns and usually can be found for $10 or less.  The Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is the best in it's class and at the low cost. it's not heartbreaking when one is lost.  It's also nice to have a couple on hand in the gift box for the times when someone compliments mine -- I give it away and know that I have a replacement at home."
10,"This is an update to a review I placed here 5 years ago. These blades are still a good bargain but I just learned that they cannot be re-sharpened. I sent them to Burn's Tool sharpening service and they responded that the blades were 'disposable. and will not sharpen nicely'. BUT it took me 5 years to dull 1 1/2 sets of knives (3 edges). so I am not terribly disappointed. If anyone knows somewhere that will sharpen these knives. (at a cost less that just buying new ones). please leave comment here."
9,"I brought a pair of aqua sphere goggles and they work great. they did not fog up like the rest of the goggles do and the seal works great and stay seal so it does not leak. I have brought other pairs of goggles from speedos to tyr and they all leak and fog up even when they say its anti fog and they do not seal well around my face. I aways buy aqua spheres now and no other brands of goggles. they are also easy to ajust. I would highly recamend these goggles to anyone they are great."
1,"Shaving is about as personal thing you can do. It's not an experience you can share. It doesn't make for scintillating conversation. So. PERSONALLY. the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard. My beard is pretty tough: to use the belabored joke. my five o'clock shadow makes its appearance around noon. And it's thick. However. the skin underneath is very sensitive. This razor gives me that 'close shave' without irritating my face. The price for the cartidges are. yes. a little high. But it's a small price to pay for a product that works. It's sort of like paying a little extra for 'bathroom tissues'. (But that's another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation.)"
11,"raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family. so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice. but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!"
11,"My son loves to recite the No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed story.  When I bought him the book with all 5 stories I saw these to go along with it. They're cute. and he does enjoy them but they're a tad be awkward.  They're too big to really be finger puppets on an adult's hand. let alone a 3 year old's hand. They do velcro together so they can hold hands and you can make them jump.  He was excited about them. but they aren't really a favorite of his.  I probably wouldn't pay that much money for them again."
12,"What can be more fun than running around chasing monkeys? the are plenty of levels and gadgets to play with. The only downside is that the paddle boat is impossible to control in my opinion. Each monkey has its own charateristics and weapons. just trying to run up and snag the monkey doesn't always work. special gadgets must be used first. Pretty much run around the world getting rid of monkeys using gadgets. The game is pretty explanatory but is loads of platform fun. also includes minigames that can kill some time with friends."
2,"I received this item for Christmas.  I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.  I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk. condesed milk. and cocoa powder.  At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.  It didn't swish when I shook it. so I thought I was good to go.  After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.  I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.  After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.  I will never buy ice cream from the store again.  This ice cream maker is awesome. I love it."
12,"This game actually stands up to the test of time. as opposed to Myst part one's antiquated technology. and ancient graphics...Unfortunately. I never got to play these games when they came first came out. and being spoiled with all the improvements in the visual department over the years. had to start with Riven instead of Myst. The game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all 5 games. simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future under-developed. but beautiful lands Myst would take us to..Obviously this game is for a certain type of 'quiet' gamer. who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral. button mashing action..If those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however. there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary Myst series.."
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
1,"I like this brush. though I do wish it had a suction cup. or something. so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job. though. even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand. and while it was nice. the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary."
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
7,"This saw is awesome. Took it out for it's first use today. Great power on demand at the push of a button. no worries about gas or oil. just the lube the chain and you're good to go. Sliced through moist maple like butter. Handled branches up to 8' with ease. It did. however. throw its chain after an hour of use. which was entirely my fault; do what you're supposed to. and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up (and therefore expanded!) a bit. A great. versatile tool!"
9,"I bought a 32oz peppermint one based on Backpacker Magazine's recommendation.  The 4oz bottle in REI sold for close to $5 therefore the 32oz here for $15 is a super bargain!.I chose peppermint so that I can use it as face/body/laundry/dish liquid and tooth brushing.  A tiny little bit is MORE THAN ENOUGH to wash the face and neck.  For you superlight backpackers. this is a must have for the functionality. weight to use ratio. and biodegradability.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
5,"Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb.  This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types. it's a great capo and very durable in construction and material.  Like a good guitar that is well cared for. this is something that's great to hand down to the next generation.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
2,"Like many of the &quot;Good Grips&quot; products. it's really astounding how much better this peeler is than &quot;traditional&quot; peelers (you know. the all-metal. slightly rusty thing that had been in your utensil drawer since you bought at at the supermarket when you were stocking the kitchen for your first apartment).  This inexpensive gadget produces much better results. much faster and more comfortably. than any other peeler I've ever used.  It works equally well on potatos. carrots. apples. etc.  It's cheap ($5-$6 for an essential kitchen tool you'll own for years) and works great; why in the world wouldn't you buy it?  If you cook and you don't own one. stop reading and buy one now.  It's a no-brainer."
10,"Mostly a repeat of others. so bottom-line: BUY THIS. and you won't have to buy another (unless it's stolen. like mine).I bought mine YEARS ago. and it was just stolen. so I'll be buying another one....not even going to shop around for another brand/ model!!  Plenty of power (use the removable side handle. and keep a good stance when doing high torque applications where the bit can grab).  Very rugged construction.  Comfortable grip and control (although not at the lowest end...but I don't use it for those applications anyway).  The removable cord and easy access to replace the motor brushes are nice touches. The handle threading into both the left and right-hand sides makes it easy to share with left-handers at the jobsite.What else can I say...."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
1,"Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim. flickering).  Before I sent it back. I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are. took them out. but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off. and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that. put the batteries back in and it works like my good one."
7,"First of all this does what it is supposed to and in that it is a fine product.However.Took me awhile to figure out how to get it to work (directions not so clear and not 100% self explanatory)The screws and slides allow for probably most desk rail widths.  But the tricky part is that there is a support on the pot which requires that it be braced against a post or a baluster/picket.  My deck railing has a very old style (and no longer code) style 'X' between posts.  This left very little spacing options for where the pot could be placed.  From below it looks lovely but a direct look at it the two anchors to the railing don't looks so neat (tempted to place a pot on top of them to hide them)."
9,"I can not say enough about the quality of Victorinox knifes.  Owned Spartan since November of 1978.They have never disappointed me except once when I drop my Explorer and the scale cracked.They would no longer send you a replacement scale you had to mail the knife in.I had a similar problem in 1988 and they just mailed me the scale and a new spring for my mini-scissors after we talked on the phone.If you need a tougher knife just get the Silver Alox type. limited styles no toothpick or tweezers but they are great."
10,"its simple and works well. the tube holding up the light has trouble handling the weight of CFL bulbs. It does not stay where you put it and sags. Thanks nancy for getting rid of old filament light bulbs. It is great having toxic mercury bulbs in work shops where they get broken alot. It really isnt safe putting CFL bulbs in this product due to mercury poisoning. I have not found an LED that fits the narrow opening yet. The bulb weight is an issue for the tube holding the light fixture. My old filament bulbs have no trouble but you cant get high watt bulbs anymore.I recommend DEWALT stiffen up this product given CFL type bulbs will only be availlable in the future. It simply cant handle the weight of the CFL bulbs."
5,"Forget all the volume drop comments.  There isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit.  I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals. They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in.  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads. and of course 'Born On The Bayou'.  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it.  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on. I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it."
10,"Easy to grip and handle.  Low on vibration and noise.  Lets you get right up next to areas you don't want sanded with full sanding capability to the very edge.  Beats anything I've owned so far for controllability and ability to get in tight corners and edge sand on fine work.The ONLY complaint I've got is with the dust collection system.  The bag tends to jump off on anything you're doing that isn't flat and horizontal.  And a vacuum attachment would be greatly appreciated. too.But. I'd buy it again. even with that shortcoming."
11,"The At the Zoo Jumbo puzzle is very cute.  The colors are lovely and the art is whimsical and fun.  The puzzle is nice and large.  It was fun for the kids to put together.  I was slightly disappointed in the quality.  We had recently put together a Ravensberg puzzle and this puzzle does not compare.  The pieces did not feel thick or smooth like the Ravensberg puzzle.  The sides of the pieces weren't as rounded.  I liked the box and it makes it easy to put this puzzle away.  Overall this is pretty puzzle that is lots of fun."
7,"On the product label it says this pot holder is 'for decks. balconies and fences'.  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing. but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post. but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2' apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.  Not exactly where I wanted the pot holder. but an okay place I guess."
4,"Cooking was a haphazard skill for me until I read Julia Child's 'The Way to Cook.' There are thousands of books that teach recipes. but very few about techniques. That is where Mrs. Child breaks from most cooking instructors and where she leaves an important mark.By explaining. quickly and simply. the most useful methods in the preparations of foods. she makes clear. with positive attitude. enthusiasm and reassurance. how the novice cook can prepare meals expertly.The accompanying video series. now on DVD. does not have all the recipes listed in the book (that would take years to go through). but the techniques are all here. well organized and easy to master. I recommend both these videos and the book itself. for the latter goes into deeper details on how the theme-and-variation approach to recipes helps demystify cooking.Julia Child made a significant difference in my life. I am forever grateful to America's First Lady of Food for patiently teaching me the way to cook."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
6,"These labels are exactly what they say they are- truly blocking. We use them within our elementary school reading program. Finally. we have labels that allow for reuse of pocket portfolios without compromising the identity of its previous owner. Besides. no one wants to use a folder that has the shadow of a name behind your own!  These labels look good. save us money and time. At home. we use them when reusing shipping envelopes and boxes. My co-workers. husband. and students love them and you will too!"
6,"I have used it in my HP1022 laser printer and my wife uses it in her Brother laser printer and it always delivers clean. clear printouts. even on side 2.Update 7/7/2014:After using this paper in my HP Laserjet 1022 printer to print documents on 2 sides of the paper. discovered that the heat produced a VERY strong curl on the ends of the paper on the first side printed and it made it extremely difficult to feed the paper back into the printer and get reliable feeding for side 2. Absolutely ruined a 2nd side printing of a 100 page document. Took 2 stars off of the original rating for this problem and don't think that I'll purchase this paper again."
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
4,"Passion of the Christ is the most controversial film of the year.  It focusses on the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ and nothing can quite prepare you for the amount of gore shown.  It is apparently 100% factual. but do we really need to be shown so much torture on screen - it simply went on and on and on.  It was so graphic that we all had to keep looking away.  There is more blood than you will ever see in a horror film.  But it doesn't end there.  Whiel carrying the crucifix. we are subjected to the beatings that Jesus received along the way.  There is a difference between implying it. and showing it.  I just felt that Mel Gibson went for the shock angle. and subjected us all to far too much gore.  Factual or not. there is no need for so much gore on a screen.  This is not how Jesus would want to be remembered."
7,"I originally chose a more expensive knee pad. ignoring these because of the single strap. However. when the ones  I ordered didn't work right. I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However. I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around. the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater. so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely. and once I adjusted the strap. very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side."
6,"Whenever I have a study group at my house. it drives me bonkers to have to demonstrate everything on a piece of paper. This easel style whiteboard is stupid easy to set up. It comes assembled already. All you do is adjust the height to where you want it. and tighten the knobs so it stays put. Then. it stays exactly where you put it until you're ready to adjust it again. You can write on both sides. Both top and bottom have the little marker holding tray on it. The legs spread out so that the easel stays nice and stable on the ground. This makes life so much easier to study. because everything is right there."
5,"First. I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them. they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band. and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable. and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself. but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable 'plinking' sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music. this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics. because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So. too bad.  I think these are great picks. but I'd like them to be made of a softer material."
11,"This is a very well made little puzzle.  The word 'Jumbo' in the product title refers to the size of the puzzle pieces - not to the size of the puzzle - and the pieces are very well sized for little hands.  The illustration is bright. beautiful. and has lots of great (and funny) little details that my daughter enjoyed finding.As for the pieces. they also seem to be very durable.  They fit together well and seem like they'll take a lot of four-year-old abuse - they can stand up to my daughter's favorite game of dancing on her puzzles after completing them.Her only complaint was the size of the puzzle.  Although the size is clearly noted in the product description. the puzzle is much smaller than the other puzzles we have.All in all. a lovely puzzle that we'll enjoy over and over again."
11,"Winner of several gaming award nominations. Village is a nice. solid worker placement strategy game that has two of the most entertaining. quirky mechanics I've seen in a while. First. a player's workers rarely move after they are placed onto the board. however time is a resource in the game and as a player accumulates time their oldest workers 'die off'. Second. players select actions by picking up goods cubes. but some goods cubes are actually time markers which give no benefit but age one's workers. While workers on the board give some benefit. family members can earn points from beyond the grave as the player with the most dead workers of each type earns bonus points at game end. The heart of the game is still to produce items and earn points at various locations on the board but I have found that managing the 'death rate' of my poor family members in the Village adds an entertaining level to an already fine worker placement game."
5,"If you expect to get what you pay for. prepare to be disappointed. Sounds weak. Sounds old. Sounds worn. Sounds dull. I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster. I can afford to pay twice as much. But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on. I am so disappointed. These strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling. tapping. pull offs. or sweepers. If you are a tone fanatic keep looking. If your guitar deserves the best. do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. Respect your GUITAR.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are made from China."
5,"This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company.  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other.  He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks. which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing. both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating. cleaning and coating effect on the components.  Wow!  And no. Andy does not own stock in. have affiliation with. or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit.  Nor do I."
10,"I ordered this stabilizer to mount on my DeWalt dw746 tablesaw.  I had been using a DeWalt 5' stabilizer plate with a Forrest WWII thin kerf blade.  At 5' in diameter. the DeWalt stabilizer effectively limited my depth of cut to about 2.5'.  After trying out the Freud 3.5' stabilizer. I can honestly say that I didn't lose any noticeable performance. and I gained enough blade clearance to once again rip/crosscut 3' stock.As an added bonus for the price. this product comes as a pair of stabilizers!  I only mounted one stabilizer on my saw (on the nut side of the blade). and was able to mount the other to my radial arm saw and greatly improve its cuts as well.I highly recommend this set of stabilizers as a good product at a great price."
12,"The very first 3D Mortal Kombat offers great graphics. new 3D worlds. the return of several fighters. tournaments. 2 on 2 kombat and much more. Scorpion. Goro. Reptile and others return to the game with a few new fighters. however the bad part is that all of the new characters have similar powers as the old characters that were not in the game. Another bad part is that unlike the past few Mortal Kombat games is that this game is very quick to beat and it lacks challenge. To make up for it though. there are the most awesome fatalities of any game. such as Scorpion's very realistic fire. the spinal removal from Sub Zero with a total 3D effect and Liu Kang's throwing his opponent straight toward the camera. Each fighter now has weapons as well to add flavor to the fight."
5,"These strings are okay. but nothing special except for the price. which is a factor when changing twice a week. I don't play enough to need changes that often anymore.So I've become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar. This doesn't mean that these strings are bad. it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because they're darker and Brand Y Steels on another because they're brighter and Brand Z on yet another.So give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least. if you want your instrument in top shape. A bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good."
1,"Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time. so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again. but I wish it lasted a bit longer!"
9,"I purchased 3 of these before a 4 day camping trip in North Idaho. I've always been on the lookout for alternatives to the traditional large blow up air mattresses that most people use while camping. which I have always found uncomfortable. unreliable. and a pain In the ass. These little mattresses worked great. The wife and kids loved them. They slept comfortably for 4 nights. The mattresses did not go flat or lose air. For the price. I would totally recommend these for camping. The only gripe I have is that they take awhile to inflate. Make sure you have a pump. because blowing these up with lung power could be a big chore.If you're thinking about buying this for backpacking. don't bother. They are bulky and heavy when deflated."
12,"I was really eager to see this installment in the Castlevania series. Mainly because of it's venture into 3-D. Well. I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. They were able to pull off a pretty decent game and that. in itself. makes it another great effort from Konami. It really reminded me alot of the older Castlevania games. yet in 3-D. Despite others mixed feelings on the game. I really enjoyed it. My only gripe. however. is that it was hard and frustrating at times with its' platform areas in levels. Once I made it pass those parts. it was great. One. in my opinion. that was worthy of my hard earned dollar. Although I love the 2-D Castlevania games a great deal. I do hope they make another game like this one in the future."
10,"If you are in the business.  then you know what a pain it is to set up your dewalt miter saw for punching out apartmenst or any area for second trim (shoe molding or scribe molding). This tool is the one for that job.  I have owned three of them.  of course it will not do what a top grade miter saw will do.  but it is not suppose to. it also works great for thresholds and for trimming doors for flooring.  i am in the fire and water restoration business and i believe you will find this tool very helpful."
4,"This movie takes the rather sanitized version of Jesus' crucificion and brings home the fact that the reality was far more brutal than any of us could imagine. Understanding what Jesus endured so that the rest of us could be saved is by far the most important aspect of christianity. People who just don't 'get' this movie are people who have no belief in the christian faith - I am not criticizing them. I am just suggesting that they may not truly understand the impact of this movie.There has been alot of criticism levelled that this movie is anti-semetic. It is not. It is telling the story as it was. If someone walks away from this movie with anger. then they have obviously not understood the message."
2,"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does. please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me."
7,"This is a good quality water hose that is safe to drink from.I keep a bowl of water outside my workshop door so the dogs can drink whilst they are out with me. I was always wary that water sat in the regular garden hose could have leeched chemicals. and I would be tainting the water of my four legged friends. I now use this hose instead.  Piece of mind. for just a few bucks.Some reviewers appear to have been shipped hoses without the rubber washer. If you dont use a washer. then it will leak. Mine came with the washer and does not leak. The washers wear out over time and need replacing. I keep these on hand:Gilmour 01RW Rubber Hose Washers"
4,"I bought this video at the same time as I bought &quot;Do the Alphabet&quot; and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for &quot;Bic Birt&quot; (Big Bird is on the box of &quot;Alphabet&quot;).  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked. but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally.  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  &quot;Alphabet&quot; tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
12,"Resident Evil: Director's Cut.  The Best Classic Survival Game ever. The Granddaddy of Survival Horror.  This simple put is the Game ever the one that started it all in Survival Horror.The bit of Acting is a bit cheesey but once you get past that.  you  in a Mansion full of  Zombies .Muntant Dogs. Lickers. snakes and mutant plants around every corner as you explore the Mansion and solve puzzles. it has some scary tone and music in the back ground and if your not fighting  for your life your running from things as you try and solve the mystery of your missing team and the dissapperance of the first team  that you came in search for.I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves Zombies and into survival horror."
6,"I dislike wrapping Christmas gifts.  I am horrible at it and if the present doesn't come out with a big ball of paper around it. then it is a major triumph of my soul.  This tape is thick enough to help me calm my wrapping paper beast.  And it holds down velvet ribbon when I don't have enough of it to go all the way around the box and have to tape it piecemeal around the bottom.  It's invisible and matte. so it makes my oddball wrapping look put together.  A wonderful thing.  Five stars."
9,"I love this soap.  I have used it to wash the dog because it doesn't have a bunch of chemical junk in it (and he liked it).  I use it to wash my hair.  I use it as a body wash.  I am sure it could be used for other things. but those are my three main uses. and I love it for those.I enjoy the minty feeling all over. however. if you are using it below the waist. you should use it lightly and be prepared to rinse it immedietly in case the minty feeling starts to become too much.  I have never had any problems other than feeling like a big peppermint but others may react differently.One thing you should be mindful of is that this stuff could gradually slow rate of water drainage in the drains of the bathroom--it gradually builds up a little. even inside the bottle itself.  It is easily remedied with a home made or commercial drain unclogger."
11,"Be sure to brush up on your Monty Python before you play this version of the Fluxx card game! It would really help to watch at least one Monty Python movie first. as there may be a couple of times you'll have to sing a song or recite lines of dialogue. And if you or ANY of your fellow players don't know anything about Monty Python. forget it. Simply choose another version of Fluxx. because playing Fluxx is supposed to be fun for everybody. Note that this Fluxx version is for a slightly older age range and will likely take a bit longer than other versions just because of the Monty Python aspects and the inevitable arguments that will take place as to whether 'Ni!' is actually a line of dialogue. ;-)"
4,"I'd like to give this movie a dozen stars. While I can not say I enjoyed it as entertainment. I've never seen a more powerful movie. GOD LOVES ME. screams from every second of film. It left me wishing I was less of a sinner. so that maybe just one less lash might have fallen. There is violence. but the love that made the violence necessary offsets it. It's life changing. I hate violence. I hate subtitles. as a protestant. I didn't get the Marian symbols. but I loved this movie. I prefer vhs to dvd. but this is one I want to dvd to get every bit of everything about the movie. Don't read the da vinci code. watch this movie. That's what Christ is about. not some half witted attempt to make Him less of who He is."
6,"Yes. this tape does look great when wrapping presents. Yes. it disappears on gift wrapped surfaces. But that's not all. I use it for my 'everyday' tape as well - great for small repairs when you need the tape to not leave a strange matte spot on the surface like 'regular' tape. Did your kids rip yet ANOTHER page in their storybook? Scotch BiftWrap tape. Did you forget to put something in that pretty mailing envelope? Carefully unseal it. and then...Scotch GiftWrap tape. Crafts. scrapbooking. kids' projects? Scotch GiftWrap tape. I only wish that more tape came on the rolls."
5,"I read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul.com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price. I usually use DR Tite Fits. but these made me change for good They have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with P90's. I also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar I built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup. I will buy another set. DR strings never disappoint."
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
10,"The photograph is misleading because it looks like a flimsy. toothpicky kind of support. Actually it is a very well made. heavy support worthy of the DeWalt table saw for which it was designed. I use it for supporting long boards and relatively heavy sheets of three-quarter inch plywood. I've owned my DW744XRS table saw for a couple of years. and all this time I've used 'horses' for my outfeed and side supports. Talk about an 'I-coulda-had-a-V-8' moment. when I first discovered the ease and efficiency of this invaluable accessory I was awestruck. If you own a DW744. these supports should be your next purchase."
10,"I used to use a Bosch in a cabinet shop that I loved using.Since I have a lot of Porter-cable tools so when PC came out with this I thought it was going to be more like a gray version of the Bosch I loved with improvements. Since everyone is in competition with each other it must be so.When I had to change my first blade I was in horror. I think I have it down now but boy is it still a royal pain. I dread blade changes but I'm getting better at it. Maybe my fingers are just getting increadibly strong.It has a lot of power and looks great.Dust blower. nice feature. blows dust directly in front of the line you're trying to cut on.If I have to start using this more I might sell it on ebay and get a new Bosch."
11,"Got for son for x-mas. just turned 7.  He has always been thrilled with trains. and loves board games.  Opened up on X-mas. was so surprised when he seen all the contents. and mapping.  3 days after the shock of the Wii wore off we started playing during his winter break.  Now play at least once a week.  He is getting better with the strategy of the game and point scoring.  Can play in a short period of time. moves along fast once you learn how to play.  It is a little more expensive then average board game. feel that is well worth it."
9,"I bought my first Spartan in 1979.  I have been using it since then and love it.  I also gave some as gifts to my brother and to friends.  Not a single complaint.  What I like most about it is that it has all the essentials - can opener. bottle opener. cork screw and screwdrivers.  The tweezers and toothpick make it even more complete.  It is not a multi-tool. but it is a compact. everyday handy tool. without frills.I finally had to buy a replacement because my daughter wanted one to go camping - except for a few scratches it looks as good as new and works like new.I Highly recommend it."
11,"This game is what helped me pull my 12 & 13yo sons away from the XBOX and play board games with me on a regular basis.  Having liked Skyrim on the XBOX. they understood the theme immediately and really wanted to do the campaign style playing.  Though is can be played not as a campaign. I am not really sure why you wouldn't.  I play the Overlord. We have just about finished &#34;Act 1&#34;.  I have won about 75% of the time. but they still enjoy it and I have too. Not too easy. not too hard. though some scenarios do really seem to favor one side over the other.  I suspect we will keep playing in this until done and then buy the expansions."
12,"In comparison to other N64 games. this piece is a worthwhile buy.  The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring. pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However. it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.  Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder. and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day.  So buy this game and spin in circles to your heart's content."
4,"I got this video knowing nothing about Dr. Ben Carson except what was written in Amazon's product description.  I like medical history dramas & I lkie Cuba Gooding Jr.  Previously. he starred with Rober DeNiro in 'Men of Honor'. another true life story of a real person.  He did a fantastic job in that other role. playing Carl Brashear. a Master Chief Petty Officer/diver & the first black diver in US Navy history.  Cuba did just as fine a job portraying Dr. Ben Carson. a renown neurosurgeon.  I watched this movie three times before writing this review.  I LOVED IT!  I also enjoy watching the special features & there was an interview with the real Ben Carson & with Cuba Gooding.  The directors have taken pains to make Cuba look as much like Ben as possible.  I'm glad I got it & sorr that three people thought it was a documentary - It is not - it is a movie."
9,"Another poster mentioned only a 1 year warranty but the box (purchased on Amazon) has a sticker that says 3 years and the warranty card in the box confirmed it. I've been using a good pair of zoom binoculars for watching boats and they are fine if I have a tripod. This Canon Image Stabilization (IS) 10x30 solves the problem beautifully. They are far more useful than standard binoculars because you can concentrate on the details of whatever you're watching without straining to hold them steady. They are very comfortable to hold as they are compact and light weight. Everybody who tries them breaks into a big smile when they press the IS button!"
1,"I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen. and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds. My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation. I could hardly touch my nose. After a few days using it. my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed. I don't have the burning dryness. it doesn't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose (believe me. that's an achievement).I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe. 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I'm out. since this is Wisconsin and it's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists. treatments and sprays I've been advised to use."
5,"I got these for a parts-tele I built and I'm really happy with them.  Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger.  But they look great. work great. stay in tune and are completely vintage spec.  I have a '57 reissue strat and I can't tell the difference.  One thing I've always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
1,"In the past our ENT recommended we use Ayr Saline Nasal Gel.  Our ENT said the Ayr gel would keep our noses from getting overly dry.  He said this would help prevent us from getting so many sinus infections.  He also suggested we each use a Neti Pot and saline solution.  As the doctor pointed out. you can keep Ayr gel with you at all times. but you cannot always keep a Neti Pot with you.I don't know why. but we sneeze almost each time we apply the Ayr gel.  The sneezing last for a few seconds and then the sneezing stops.  The Ayr gel moisturizes our nasal cavities. which helps us to have fewer nosebleeds.Amazon and Wal Mart charge the same price for the Ayr gel. but when we go to Wal Mart. they are often out of stock.  I was glad to find it here at Amazon.  When I bought it from Amazon. Amazon had temporarily lowered their price."
5,"The winder works well for me. and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips). but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  Also. the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy. and doesn't work well for reluctant pins.  I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more. but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter. so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon."
10,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes. I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling. and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution. purchase a 'Biscuit Press'.  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion. and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits.  If you use a lot of biscuits. this tool is a must.  This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
4,"I was pleased to see this video when it first came out and I recommend it very much. I watched it with my sons. who were born in 1965 and 1966. all the years they were growing up.  They are now fine parents themselves.  I  believe it expresses very well the true meaning of Christ-mas. The review  from T. Liptak says it very well.  It puts Christ back into Christmas where  He belongs.  It was and still is one of very few videos that tell what  Christmas is about - the greatest gift of all to a sad and needy world -  the gift of Christ. that's why we celebrate Christ-mas."
7,"We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post. It's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence. which is why I was interested to see this planter design. I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight. That being said. I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while. It's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences."
6,"In this yet another superior product from Avery. these laser shipping labels can be accommodated to any size envelope as they are not too big and not too small. so as to  seem not aesthetically fitting.Their actual size is 2' x 4'. guaranteed to be jam free and smudge free (haven't tested this claim extensively yet as I have just begun to use them.  So far they work out fine and my printer likes them).I've often bought small labels for small envelopes. and larger for bigger ones.  Now I don't have to do that anymore. slightly uncomplicating my life.  And that's welcome!These labels also cover any printing underneath should one want to send something out in a used enveloped.  That's a pennysaver!Thanks. Avery. for another fine product."
12,"I can't say anything about DOOM that has already been said only complainant is due to the fact that it's on a console it had to cut out levels & parts of levels out. It's of course a FPS it basically made the 1st person shooters popular cause like every other game now is a d@*&ntilde; FPS. But in DOOM you have to solve puzzles find key cards it just wasn't about running & gunning. It's got a simple but effective story in space scientist are experimenting with portals the Demons from h** come through & all h** breaks loose. eventually the Demons come to Earth & you have to stop the invasion. I can't do the game justice but yes if you never have played DOOM it's a great game & you go to war with your 9MM shotgun double barrel shotgun rotary cannon rocket launcher plasma rifle & the Big F**ing Gun!"
9,"Solidly made and easy to use.  The process for picking a combo is straight forward and it will fit on everything from my .22 pistol to my 12 GA shotgun.  The tumblers are smooth and feel solid in the housing for the price you can't beat this little lock to keep any unwanted hands off your trigger.  I take mine out when we go to the range to keep kids and moron's from shotting each other while I'm shooting or working with another shooter and don't have eyes on my weapons.  Plus with the combo you don't have to worry about forgetting/not finding keys when you need them."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
9,"I have used this griddle on the stove. in the oven. and on the grill.  The seasoning it came with was adequate enough for me to get started cooking right away.  I am a novice at cast iron cooking but have been studying up on the best techniques to try and avoid some of the horror stories of other first time users.  The first items I cooked were some hamburgers and had no problem with sticking.  After several more meals (one including a couple of strips of bacon) I attempted an egg.  I had no problem with the egg sticking and as always cleanup was a breeze.  As long as you take proper care of this griddle I see no reason why it shouldn't last a life time with little to no sticking.  On a side note. my wife has said that I have made the best tasting hamburgers and steaks while using this griddle."
7,"I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $2 trowel from my local HD. of course. it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand. is built to last. I couldn't really tell from the pictures. but once I inspected and held it. I could feel the quality and after testing it. I noticed a huge difference. the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig. is simply great.What I like the most is the design. the handle is a  solid metal piece. thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last."
12,"Golden Eye 007 is still one of the best action titles ever created. along with the best licensed product ever released. The action is still superb and well-polished even since its release 10 years ago. The enemies are still smart. even with competitors like F.E.A.R. which have incredibly intelligent artificial intellignce. There are a couple of issues unfortunately; some targeting problems and odd save layouts. Other than those. this game is still one of the best shooters ever made. The missions are excellent. the enemies are cool. the weapons are cool. and virtually everything else about this game is superb and well-executed. Too bad Nintendo handed the rights of James Bond to EA."
2,"my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis. and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker. well... just hilarious.  I have no such entertaining stories. just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher. no fuss. no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel. putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood."
11,"My wife and I are starting to get into more advanced board games as we age. We have always loved games such as monopoly. clue and other such games. We decided that we wanted to spread our wings and try a little more complex game. This was a fantastic choice! When I say it is advanced it is by no means hard to play. It has smooth gameplay that I believe all ages could learn. The entire game revolves around your decisions as governor which buildings you will build to ward off invading armies. This leads to the decision of prestigue building or defense. Everyone in our family loves this game and it has given us hours of enjoyment!"
7,"I have been doing yard work for 40 years. so I am no 'backyard rookie'.  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The 'PowerGear' fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say. everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews. both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said. I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly."
1,"I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good. but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly. I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance. nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching. so that the good part about the blades. However. after a month of use. for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall. decent purchase. nothing extraordinary."
12,"This game has crossed the 'I Like You' line. It's just like the old one from NES. although. I know about the dungeons and the weapons because I have the old one. So. it's fun to play for a while until you get to the Water Temple. it gets confusing there. So. use the Player's Guide to cheat. so that you won't get stuck. I played a long time ever since it came out. It was the game that caught my eye and though I had to have the game. I am a Zelda fan and I hope that you have fun playing it as well. I just like to see Link grow up."
7,"I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50. 75. and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course. it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility. which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather. but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking. but they're not kink-proof. either. nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others. but the latter were fairly stiff. so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
10,"This is one item I would recommend people purchase from a local dealer not Amazon. Like another reviewer mentioned the packaging is terrible. I received mine and the small stationary wooden top of the table was broken into three parts even though the external packaging showed no real damage. This part breaks where it has grooves routed into it across its width. it is so badly supported I would expect it to get broken in shipment more often than not. The movable part of the table top also had some cosmetic damage. Amazon has been helpful but a replacement top arrived damaged as well. I just ended up making my own parts to fix it. The table is actually pretty good and I needed a fold down table given lack of space in my garage."
4,"I have recommended this movie more times than I can remember since I first saw it.  As a retired school teacher. I would say it is a MUST if you want children to be motivated toward excellence AND it assuredly gives parents a much needed 'heads up' about how much time our children are wasting on anything and everything that is not preparing them for their future success.  A true story is always the best movie for me and I am so glad I have this one in my library.  I am continually getting it out to share with someone."
4,"Beautifully acted and filmed (by the son of noted Holocaust denier Hutton Gibson). obviously made with 'passion' for the (literal and figurative) self-flagellation crowd. After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah. I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114). with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place. it just starts to get a little silly. kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is. of course. not very funny. especially when the punishment is Death By Torture. so I did my best not to laugh.If Evangelicals. Opus Dei Catholics. sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing. they are most welcome to. To the curious. but more sqeamish. of my fellow nonbelievers. I would not suggest watching this after a heavy meal. If you must do so. keep a bucket handy."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
10,"I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade.  The Milwaukee never flinched.  I have relied upon it for cutting wood. of course. but also occasional concrete and brick work.  It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate. which straightened quite well.  However. eye protection is a must.  I know it should always be. but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades. but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.  I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face.  I rarely use the Tilt-Lok. but it came in handy a couple of times."
9,"This is a great mat for the price. Enough cushion for floor exercise. easy to clean and carry. The one drawback is the fluffy nature of the foam. It isn't dense foam. So despite its thickness. it bottoms out pretty easily. making this a good mat for soft and slow moves. but wholly inadequate for anything that might involve impact. I used this for my prenatal yoga floor work and loved the cushy support for my aching hips and back. Overall. better than a typical extra thick yoga mat. but don't expect yoga mat density/quality."
11,"This game looked like fun but after trying it. I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion. then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171.212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review. but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game."
5,"This is a decent pop filter. It gets the job done but it has a few flaws. It attracts a good amount of dust. the screen tends to mess up (which caused me to tear the first screen). & the goose neck tends to unwrap it's self out of place. It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in. Other than that. it's a decent pop filter but not for the price. Under $10 would've been better. I should have went with something cheaper than $20 *cough cough* the Auphonix pop filter *cough cough* but. I will in the future."
10,"I purchased this for my jointer. but after setting all the pieces together on my bench. I realized the smallest width it could be was 16'. My jointer measures 12'. I had to put a plywood base into the finished framework to set the jointer on. I have the HTC mobil base and for now on thats what I will purchace. As with the other reviewers. It's sloppy with the 1 1/2' boards. The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop. They tell you to drill 7/16' holes and that is way to big. For those of you that don't have a drill press. you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides. This will give you a more accurate hole. I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
6,"These 'Avery White Shipping Labels' are perfect for my use.  Before I got these. I used two address labels on all my postage: One for the address of the person with whom I am corresponding and another for my return address.With this label I am able to fit my return address on the upper left side of the label  and the shipping address on the lower right side of the label.One of the nice things about Avery products is that a person can get a template free that works well with each specific product.  In this case a person can get Avery template 5163 (template and software) on the internet.  I have used Avery templates for many years and found them perfect for the designed label (in this case label 5263).I recommend 'Avery White Shipping Labels for Laser Printers'.  This is a quality product."
5,"I love this product. It came fast. included extra shockmount line. shockmount. an adapter. the mic. instructions. and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting. The sound quality is great with the Art Tube Preamp(use mic cables. not 1/4' cables for Phantom Power). and I couldn't be happier with it. It even looks impressive. Although. I do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny. when in reality it is this 'off-silver' color. Almost a gold. but not quite. It's not bad or anything. just different. And frankly. the thing could be purple for all I care- as long as it produces great sound. that's all that matters. Great product. and extremely affordable. No complaints."
11,"This fits perfectly.  Put all the angry reviews aside and choose for yourself .  I shopped around to find the best deal.  The elf that comes with the book looks nothing like a girl.  This skirt helps fix that.  The doll kinda looks creepy without it.  This might be what prevents screams in terror.  I was worried my kids would be scared of the doll after the first time I saw it for myself.  The skirt softens the creep factor.  Considering how many stories I hear of kids being terrorfied of the bow elf doll.  This should be considered.  We bought this and one other design and my girls love their adopted elf"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I have been so sick of failed air mattresses that deflate or get the mystery holes. and you spend a lot of money on them.  I decided to try these.  I bought three of them. one for myself and my two kids. This is much more comfortable to me as when I shared a mattress with my kids I would be the one squishing it down. as I weigh much more than them. and waking up with my hips on the ground; which really killed my back!  These mattresses can be a pain to air up and deflate. but with the use of a pump both of those processes are much easier."
11,"My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework. She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence. so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading. I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy  for her to check to see how much time she had left. She really enjoys it. it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page. I am very happy with it."
4,"Outstanding. Not only did Mel Gibson show the suffering that Jesus endured on his final hours of life. but the compassion and loving kindness he has for all mankind.When I went to see this film. which was on the very first release day. when the film ended not one person left the cinema. We all sat there and watched as the credits and music played. I am not sure why we did this. Maybe we saw what life is truly about. and we didn't want it to end there. Or maybe we were shocked that this happened. and we have taken it for granted for all these years.What I do know is that this film is outstanding. It is the best film I have ever seen. because it impacted me in such a positive and good way. Highly recommended."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
2,"My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.  I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.  I am very pleased with it.  It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner. my old model used to scream like a banshee.  and it doesn't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model.  It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor. this model is great."
9,"My only experience with playing Horseshoes is when I was a kid with my Dad. so I wasn't quite sure what to look for when I got the whim to build a pit in our backyard.  I went to the local sporting store and looked at sets and they seemed kind of cheesy so I came on here to look up sets and found this one.  It was a little pricier than the ones in the store so I was hesitant to order. but after reading the reviews I did and after getting I them I found they are definitely worth the few extra bucks.  They are quality. well-constructed and Made in the USA.  They feel good in my hand and came with instructions to refresh me on how to play the game.  The paint has chipped some but that hasn't bothered me since it doesn't interfere in playing the game.  I would recommend this set to anyone interested in backyard games."
4,"I think everyone should see this movie at least once. Then never again. There is this cool book. the Bible. tells the whole story without all the blood and tears. I saw this movie with a group of my friends and we were all crying by the end. Even the ones who aren't religious. It is a very powerful movie. But not a movie I would want to see over and over again. Not only because there is not a lot of replay value. but also because of the sheer violence."
5,"These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....They Have a Gell  center.  Whitch  tingles.  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say....If U have hand problems.  try these.....they really work."
7,"This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed. The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely. The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture. being a flimsy plastic. but it does what it is supposed to perfectly. There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage. The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special. but are again. quite effective. I have placed a variety of seeds in this. from tomatoes. to peppers to quinoa to tobacco. and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days. Anyways. even though of flimsy manufacture. the price is right and the goods are effective. so i give this 4 stars accordingly. Just be gentle with it. and if necessary. save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy!"
2,"I connected some quick disconnect fittings to this Y fitting. Two of the openings in this Y were the right size. but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it. but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
11,"We purchased this for my in-laws for Christmas this year and played with my father-in-law. step-mother-in-law. brother-in-law (11). and sister-in-law (13).  Everyone LOVED it.  The game was quick to pick up and start playing as the rules are not too complicated. As we played more it remained challenging as we all started to develop more strategy.  Played with 6 people and the games usually averaged 30 minutes - about the perfect time."
12,"Zelda &quot;occarina of time&quot; is much like the rest of the Zelda series... it doesn't disappoint! With really cool items to collect and using your songs/spells to warp around. the entire game offers whole new dimensions.Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world. play carnival-like games to win power-ups. collect hard-to-find items such as the two-handed sword (which is better than the master sword. but you can't use a shield). magically powered arrows. and more!This game is fairly easy to beat. but finding everything will take you much longer!"
8,"My dog absolutely loves these treats and I really feel they have helped her! She has a congenital hip problem and now arthritis has set in. She has a very pronounced limp after laying down for awhile. but since she's been eating these treats. we've noticed a difference in her not limping nearly as bad. I was going to purchase another bag this past week. but the price jumped up over $3.00 per bag in the short time since I purchased them the first time. I ended up looking at more treats with glucosamine in them and bought something else that seemed to be a better price & she at least likes them. I really wish the price hadn't jumped up so much because I would have bought more. but the difference was too much for me!!"
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply  tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Shuttle is not speedy. but again adds some nice abilities and characters and the support role it can add to a fleet is quite a lot of fun"
10,"Sturdy with an adjustable mouth and blade tilt.Understand you will need to prep this before use. The sole is not precision ground but machine rough. so you will need a granite block and sandpaper or a set of flat block diamond hones. Once you have your sole (and sides) honed and flat you will need to sharpen the blade. There are several jigs and sharpening tools to assist in this. After all is done apply an anti-rust agent such as wood wax or Boeshield.Once prep'd this is a great plane."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
12,"This is a classic game that I come back to every now and again. The graphics are great and the content is really satisfying. But I do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the game.1st island - The easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems. The hardest level here is Native Fortress.2nd island - Slightly harder but still fun. The hardest level here is Sunset Vista.3rd island - The most frustrating. I spent half an hour to beat Generator Room with Perfect and another half an hour with Toxic Waste. The hardest level here is Slippery Climb.I don't get why a kid's game can get difficult to beat. I mean. I own mature games like Jak 2 and Oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison. If you are looking for a challenging game. this is your cup of tea. But if you want a kid's game that you can just glide through. I recommend Spyro."
5,"I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks! They are so grippy. I haven't broken a single one yet. they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio. so it's hard to loose them. but I still do. If you have like a child. nephew. niece. sibling. or parent that plays guitar or bass you can't go wrong with getting these for them. or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord. and if you are lucky enough not to break them. they just slip out of your hands while you're playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however. and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that."
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
8,"I ordered three of these and this item is great. I own an 11 week old German Shepherd puppy that loves to chase a tennis ball and she grows bigger every single day. I was afraid that if I got a ball that was 'her' size that I would not be able to keep it as she grows. but these seem to be just the right size. she can carry it around in her mouth just fine - she was carrying regular ones at 7 weeks!They float and they also bounce great like a normal tennis ball. just bigger. Only time will tell about the durability. but these seem like the right size for large dog breeds to play fetch with in and out of the water."
11,"The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh (a cat and a dog). Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back. thus. no need to guess where each goes. However. although they are rated by degree of importance. you cannot see the numbers thus. if you wanted to place them in a different order. it is completely possible. Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days. The images are charming (just like traditional Little People toys) and the colors are beautiful. The numbers are lined by color so as you can see. other than teaching about the nativity. the calendar can be used to reach about numbers. colors and dates. Good investment."
4,"My 2 year-old son loves almost anything Elmo. so this was a no-brainer.  This was the first Elmo's World DVD I bought for him. because he loves dogs and farms.  It turns out. though. that the baby segment is his favorite.  We like to sing along with 'Old MacDonald.'  Now that we have Tivo. I could have just recorded the last 20 minutes of Sesame Street every day. but this DVD was a nice addition to our library."
11,"My son is now working on his second book - after last year's success. we will be doing a book every year (he's 6 now).  The book takes time to do properly. and certainly needs an adult's help at this age. but the end result is more worthwhile than virtually any other gift he's gotten.  The look on his face. seeing his name and story and pictures put together in the beautifully bound book...  I'll never forget it. and I never have to.  It happens every time he reads HIS book!  Highly recommended"
11,"At first I considered not getting this game. but after watching plenty of YouTube videos about the gameplay and strategy involved I decided to go for it. This game is super fun and involves a lot of strategy. I've played it with my family and they enjoy it a lot. especially since it's concepts are super streamlined and it's easy to &#34;see&#34; what is going on unlike a lot of other designer board games. The learn curve for this is very short since it's mainly just placing workers each turn. I enjoy it a lot and I just got a hold of the expansion for it. so I'm excited to give it a try. Give this game a try if you know you like worker placement."
1,"These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points:- the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens-- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it&#8217;s very light (but may not take a beating over time)-  it&#8217;s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously.  I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves.  I keep these magnifiers on my desk. in my briefcase. and in a backpack and I like them a lot."
9,"Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue.unlike the black/gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy.wrong!This product is as shoddy as most 'BEll products' are.The rear light went out first.then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of 'Bell products' ever again.That's why i'm now a 'Cateye's' and 'Nite Ize' product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost."
1,"I put this lotion on everything. It is hands down one of the most important beauty products that I couldnt live without. I use this all over and it is the ONLY lotion I have found which 1. doest break me out. 2. actually moisturizes my skin. 3. I can use on my body and my face. I blend drops of hyaluronic acid which I buy from Amazon in with the moisturizer for an added boost. It keeps my skin glowing. smooth and beautiful.I also use this on my boyfriends KP and it is the first time he said he has had any success in getting it to go away.I am impressed with this product more than any other beauty product."
6,"I bought these to print out pictures. cut them up into puzzle pieces. and place them on a magnetic rectangle so they can be rearranged into the right places. The magnet they are placed on is pretty substantial (at least the thickness of all 5 sheets of this paper). and the puzzle pieces stick fine when the whole thing is lying on a table. but when I lift it up sometimes the pieces fall off!I tried sticking a piece on my fridge and it wouldn't stay--and the packaging says it will stick AND hold up a piece of paper on most metal surfaces. I couldn't get it to stick at all! And the magnetic paper just stuck on a good magnet doesn't even stay very well when it's lifted off the table so that gravity is affecting the pieces. Overall. it works fine for my purposes because the puzzles are meant to stay on a table. but I just can't see any use for them beyond that."
6,"The item holds my new 22 inch LCD just fine.It doesn't bounce and shake if knocked. so the monitor is nice and safe.We bought three and all three came with cheap. sloppy paint jobs. So to match my all black computer I spray painted them and it looks like I bought it that way.The space under is perfect for my Logitech Wave Keyboard to slid out of the way or a nice place to throw those pads of sticky notes. pens and whatnots.OVERALL:We've bought one for all three family members and its been great to gain some desk space and ensure we are more ergonomic by having the monitor at the correct hight for the desk/chair setup. Its the cheapest metal unit I could find and it holds up under the weight just fine."
9,"Been using this for years. A little goes a long way. and it gets you clean and minty. Makes your eyelids and. um. some other parts. tingle like mad. to the point of being nearly annoying. but it is a transient sensation. Don't get this stuff in your eyes while wearing contacts. burns like hell. But that is true of many soaps.  I use this stuff for both soap and shampoo. it is gentle enough for that. at least for a (non-metro) guy."
9,"The 38' size is a good deal for the price and works okay.  I did manage to put it together all by my lonesome instead of the 3 people the directions say are needed.  But... The chemical odor from the blue stretch cover is AWFUL.  I am going to stick this thing outside to see if that helps air it out.  If not. the cover is coming off.  It is too strong to use right now and that is why the 3 stars.  Nothing made for living creatures should smell that horrible.  I refuse to use it further until the smell is gone.I'd love to hear if others have had this issue."
6,"If you are the person that wraps gifts with the comics section of the paper or buys 99 cent rolls of paper then this would be a bit of overkill for you. if you care about your package and you purchase high quality paper then you need this tape. it looks great! The satin finish can't be beat. For about 4 bucks you get about 27 yards of tape. I think that is quite acceptable. If you buy those 50 cent rolls from Big Lots or Walmart you will only get about 6 yards of tape per roll and its crappy tape.The one thing that annoys me to no end with this is the serrated cutting bar. If if were just a smidge wider than the tape it would work way better. Many times it has not cut the tape correctly unless it's just right-so annoying!I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? no"
4,"We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies. dogs. and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well. And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies. dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies. Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids."
6,"I have a bad lower back and currently enrolled in physical therapy. I have pain going down the back of one leg. To me it seemed as though propping up that foot alleviated the foot pain. I had a more expensive foot rest in my cart and decided to give a cheaper model a try first to see if it cut down on my leg pain. FWIW - It has a bit. but not entirely. now onto the review.As others alluded to. this is an expensive piece of plastic. It is very cheaply made. It has two levels that you can chose from a higher or lower resting level. This has a rocker like motion so that you're feet aren't in a set position all the time. However. this rocking motion is not fluid. and is downright noisy.It does tend to stay in place well. and serves its purpose. I would say that there are better choices out there."
1,"First of all. let me say that whenever I tried a brand other than 'Band-aid' I was disappointed.  That said. I believe this particular style is the best I have found.  When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand. I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers. to protect them so they would heal.  All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short.  This one is just right. The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long.  The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it.  Also. the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic. so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well.  It is water resistant.  Buy this one for your general use.  You will probably save money in the long run."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
9,"I recently purchased one of these coolers and am very pleased with how well it worked. as quiet as a whisper.  The power consumption is reasonable.  If battery drain is a concern. once the Koolatron is cold you can unplug it for a while and it will stay cool for quite some time.The only thing I had to watch out for was that it froze my soda pop because I used it in a cool environment when it should have been switched off.  Only the things in the very bottom of the cooler froze.  Everything else was just fine.The Koolatron is attractive with contemporary colors - white. beige. and grey.  It's slender rectangular profile is proportioned for pop or beer cans to fit perfectly.  It's a well thought out product worth what they are asking for it.  Cool stuff.Overall. I am very happy with this purchase and am excited that I finally have a safe means for storing food in my camper van."
6,"These shipping labels work great for recycling mailers.  I've used them to mail several packages & it's a great convenience to no longer have to spend five minutes or more trying to peel off old labels before re-using padded mailers.With Avery's TrueBlock technology. it's a snap to quickly print a label that completely covers the old label. These labels work just like conventional laser labels--just use Avery's template to print the labels you need.  The 'magic' is in the dark. vinyl-like coating on the 'sticky side' of the label.  This dark screening coat completely blocks out the label underneath. so nothing shows through.  Just a clean. neatly printed new. bright white label.Elegantly engineered recycling solution; Highly recommended!"
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
1,"BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo. Camelbak. Thermos to name a few).  Some are BPA free plastic. some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands).  The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles. but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried).  The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis.  I donated our other ones after receiving this."

6,"I often buy colored envelopes because I think they look so nice when you get them in a stack of mostly white mail. But if you want to use labels. the white rectangles look so ugly. These are perfect! I find they don't stick quite as well as the white ones. but never had one come off and get returned.They don't really help with dark colored paper (including most reds) because the black ink doesn't stand out enough). but for pastels or off whites. they are beautiful."
11,"I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these. I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other (some Cranium game I don't remember the name of). but this one is a bit different. The artwork is cute. But. for some reason. I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game. I feel like the gameplay is just so-so. I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly. I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends. but it can be fun from time to time. I like that the games can be over fairly quickly (within 1 hour)."
8,"The Chuckit Launcher is a necessity if you have a dog that enjoys the game of fetch.  I have always known about this product but considered it for the lazy man.  My yellow lab has enough energy to make a game of fetch feel like pitching nine innings in the big leagues.  It would get to the point where I would have to ice my shoulder.  I eventually invested in one of these and now use it regularly.  Once you get the hang of the throwing motion you can launch the ball incredible distances with very little effort.It came with a fuzzy tennis ball which I eventually replaced with a Chuck glow ball.  This rubber ball is much better then any tennis ball and glows in the dark so I can use it at night.I gave this 5 stars because it has now become an essential tool to deal with my dogs energy.  Keeping her exercised makes life a lot easier in the house."
10,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words. this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second. the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way. if you experience a lot of noise. the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
6,"I'm actually a travel agent. and I purchased these to use in plastic luggage tags that I give to my clients.  They work just fine.  I do find that the edges look a little better than other brands that I've tried. though because of the way I use them. that's not as much of an issue for me. it certainly would be if you're actually using them as your business card.  On other brands. you will sometimes see a little 'fiber' around the card. and you don't see that with these."
1,"My husband is very picky about shave gels. primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin.  My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack. even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping.  He is not happy with this product.  He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products. namely. Gillette Fusion. which he prefers.  Also. insofar as use on his sensitive skin. the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However. what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left. which he will grudgingly use. unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.  He's encouraging me to find one...soon."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
2,"I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours. I looked everywhere for the smallest size. they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook."
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
11,"My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is challenging and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large. flat surface to create the tile patterns. and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles. it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall. however. I highly recommend it. even for adults."
10,"I've made hundreds of cuts on this 6' dado set over the last 5 years.I've been happy. but it's not perfect. and I think Freud sometimes charges for their name when less expensive competitors are about as good. I would tryMibro 491071 6-Inch Stacking Dado BladeorOshlun SDS-0630 6-Inch 30 Tooth Stack Dado Setif I needed another set.The case is well designed. Saves you time. and saves the blades. The red plastic wing nut thingees both cracked. but Freud sent me new ones when asked.It would be nice if the shims were factory labeled. You need to clean. measure. and mark them. and the marker writing eventually wears off.There is sometimes a little blow-out on the cross-cuts. but any dado set will do that. Use a scrap of wood against the trailing edge."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
6,"After years of using an ink-jet printer. I finally bought an economical laser printer.  These laser labels are perfect for the kind of labels that I keep handy - a few dozen printed labels for each family member. and my own return labels.I had no problem running these through my Brother laser printer. using Word 2011 for Mac. template 5267.  Avery is always worth the extra money! Their quality is outstanding. and this product is no different.  The labels don't jam. they line up properly. and they peel easily.  In other words. they work well. and they don't annoy me when I go to use them. and that is something I look for in a product I pay a premium for.  Avery is my go-to for printer products -- worth the few extra cents (or even a dollar) because I know it will get the job done over the months the packet will be in my desk drawer."
1,"Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades. As a professionally trained Modern. and Classical Ballet. dancer for over 30 + years. I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries. Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike. Great for contusions. bruises and over-use injuries. Recommend. Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using. and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both. for best results."
6,"So far I've used this double sided foam tape to mount photos and mounted a small clock on glass. It hasgood holding power and rated to hold 2 lbs. It does depend what you mount to. someone stated it wouldn'thold on plaster walls. if the surface you use is weak the tape isn't going to change this fact. I mounted abadge back on a cars painted surface. this tape is strong enough for jobs like this. This is a good generaluse double sided white foam tape. the roll is 1/2' wide X 75' long. other sizes are offered but I found thisis a good general use size."
9,"I bought mine from a nearby Wal-Mart and it's worked perfectly so far.  Having never installed one before. I just took my time & had some extra zip ties ready...just in case.  The only tool you'll need is something to trim the ends off the zip ties when you're done.  I like the 'scan' mode which flips thru max speed. avg. speed. distance. total time. etc.  On the down side. I bought another for my son's bike.  It either had a bad sensor or a broken wire from the sensor to the unit.  It never did work.  I took it back for a refund.  For $10 - what do you expect?  You may get one that works fine - you may not."
6,"As I writer. I am often sending out short story manuscripts to potential markets. I'm a great recycler of envelopes. but I spend far too much time trying to peel and/or scrape off the old labels while trying not to tear into the envelopes. These thick labels (they call it 'TrueBlock Technology') will go right on top of the old labels and cover them up completely. Works like a charm! They're big enough for long addresses or large fonts. and you can even create logo shipping labels with them."
2,"Here in Penna. we make pickled eggs. also known here as red beet eggs.  I use this container for that.  The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.  The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.  I've had mine for five to ten years. and it is still good as new.  I just bought one for my mother.  She had her red beets eggs in a jar. which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.  I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.  I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.  I also know someone who uses hers. without the strainer. to store brown sugar.  So. it is a multi-purpose container."
12,"FF7... if you've ever played this game. the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is. basically. sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud. Barrett. and Tifa (oh. yeah. there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in. equipped with HUGE swords. a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those). and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play. and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect. with tight controls which respond perfectly. an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm. and some kick ... bosses. ..."
11,"Party Gras is a fun game. IF you have a couple of things readily available:1. A Large Group of People - Party Gras shows a minimum of 4 players. but that is too small a group to play. Party Gras is best played with a group of 10 or more.2. People willing to be goofy. - You really have to lose your inhabitions playing Party Gras. If you have some party poopers. afraid to look foolish. then they will hate this game.3. Adult Beverages - This can REALLY help with loosening people up.The whole idea of Party Gras is to complete tasks given on a card - For instance getting another player to ask you to lower your voice. meaning you have to begin talking loudly until someone asks you to quiet down. To win the gamye you have to collect beads from other players while giving yours away. But in reality. Party Gras's main purpose is get folks laughing and having a good time. it's not really about winning or losing."
12,"Sonic Heroes will be EXTREMELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!  I haven't played it yet. but I know it will be great. and hopefully the bad camera views from the Adventure series will be vanished.When I say A blast from the past. I mean that Sonic Heroes is one of his old games. blown up into 3D. (New stages. of course...)I can't think of anything else to put!  Just get Sonic Heroes when it comes out cuz IT'TL ROCK!"
10,"It's really a pity that this saw is no longer made. I bought mine over 20 years ago. and since then it's built cabinets in my house. remodeled a friend's restaurant. and been loaned out many time. It's light. powerful. and cuts very smoothly with no vibration. If you're making cabinetry and not cutting 2x lumber you really don't need a 7-1/2&#34; saw. This unit is smaller. lighter. and a real pleasure to use. I'm hoping I can keep mine going for another decade or two."
10,"This collector does a fine job. It has great power and makes little noise. I ran hundreds of feet of hose and bought all kinds of blast gates and attachments for everything I could think of. It works but only for one tool at a time. I guess I'm trying to do too much with it. It will run all day without a complaint. I bought a remote start for it though . I think it's a good thing to have. If you have a small shop you can't beat this unit. It has a little more power than some of the others in this price range."
10,"I've had the sander for about a year now and it is pretty good overall.  The compact size lets it go into tight workspaces.  It is light weight and can easily be operated with one hand.  This weekend I spent about 7 hours sanding and even after several hours of continuous use it worked well.  I have a couple of small complaints.  First the dust bag does tend to pop off frequently. which can be a messy nuisance.  In addition. the dust collection is poor.  Most of thet sawdust ends up in the air.  Next you can really feel the vibration in your hands.  After about 2 hours my hands feel like they are falling asleep.  Also the unit gets very hot after prolonged use.  It won't get hot enough to burn you. but it does make it more uncomfortable to hold.  On the plus side. it has a good quality compact case that holds plenty of sandpaper."
1,"I have read from a lot of people saying it doesn't leave you groggy but if I take more than half a teaspoon I find it makes me that way.  I don't take melatonin unless I cant sleep at all or if I am not tired but it starts to work pretty fast no matter how much I take.  I guess since its a liquid it affects you quicker since I have used the pill form before.  My 3 year old who is autistic has problems sleeping and staying asleep and as far as getting to sleep she will usually go to sleep in about 10 to 15 minutes.  This was recommended over medication from our doctor which is what we prefer.  She still wakes up some nights but I don't think it has too much to do with the melatonin as it is with her.  Overall I recommend this to help people sleep naturally without resorting to medication."
10,"I bought this saw about a month ago now and have used it a few times. Its very smooth. Very little vibration and when you bolt it down on quarter inch rubber it has no vibration at all. (I used an old tire inner tube.) I bought this with a Moto foot pedal. That leaves your hands on your work. The tension lever is great. Right up front where it should be. The cast table size is great for bigger projects. I got this saw as a member of Amazon Prime. I ordered it overnight air with Saturday delivery. It was an extra $9.95 freight. This is a 66 lb saw. Gotta love Amazon Prime."
9,"These bands are great.  The only room for improvement would be better carabiners/clips.  The carabiner like things have sticky springs and have sharp edges which could potentially cut through the bands.  It is nice to be able to attach the bands to other things and I have used a bit of rope to tie them off to poles and trees.  Use a bowline around the tree and a linemans loop to secure an additional carabiner to.  This set comes with an exercise guide.  These bands are good when paired with the BMP exercise ball because you can focus on muscle groups.  Isolate the hips for those ab exercises!  Have fun. mix it up!"
2,"This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I bought the last one several years ago and it is still running strong.  I wanted a second one to keep upstairs.  This little Quick Up is exactly as advertised. What a time saver.  It is  light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless.  It is a little Go To machine and I think anyone would be glad they purchased it.  This would be a great gift I think anyone would be delighted to receive.change"
10,"This thing is a BEAST. it will eat up and chew through any wood you are looking to refinish.  I matched this up with some 40 grit belt sandpaper and it was able to chew right through the old finish on my redwood deck.  I had used a less powerful 3x18 belt sander and there was no comparison.  While this is much heavier and you do have to stay on top of it so it doesn't get out of control. I will take that over the slower process of sanding my previous belt sander offered.  The only negative I found was there was no case/bag that came with the sander beyond that I am very happy."
2,"I purchased this timer to replace an earlier version of the same timer that stopped working.  I started out looking for a different brand. but this one was the lowest cost option.The pros:+  Low cost + free Amazon shipping!+  Easy installation & the dial plate fits over the existing switch opening.+  Easy to operate. with the exception noted below.+  Quiet operation... the fan noise is louder.The cons:-  No manual off?  It's odd they removed the manual off feature that we got used to on the earlier version of this timer.-  The knob is a bear to push on & just as difficult to remove!  I suggest installing & removing the knob a few times to loosen it up. before installing the timer.&#9658; Update - January 9. 2014This timer has been working perfectly since we installed it.  We still miss the manual off feature. :("
9,"Hands down the best air mattress I have ever used! All summer all over the country I have used this thing often relying souly on it to do the job and it performs flawless! I hope they keep the quality up. good to have a few of these things in the house or camping gear. I am 6'2&#34; and about 165 and works perfect. My hip bones don't touch the ground at all and hold nearly all it's air throughout the camping week. It's heavy not for backpacking but that's why I like it. Beach trips. people visiting. car camping. and fitting into small tents. I even accidentally laid this thing out on too of small cactus and barns in the outer banks and it never popped!"
9,"I've wanted one of these tools for a long time and I finally decided to go for it. I've handled the SwissTool as well as multi tools by Leatherman and SOG. which are brands I highly respect. I decided for the SwissTool because it feels more like a 'real' tool than the others. It is simply more substantial. appears to be sturdier. The tools locking open is also a great feature and that alone had a lot to do with my choice. You can't go wrong with any of the 3 name brands but if you need durability the choice is easier.Note: the tool comes with a sheath. So unless you dislike nylon. you don't need to order the sheath separately."
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
4,"I'm a Christian and from day one I thought I have to go and see this. I went last night with a couple of friends and I'm telling the film was overwhelming. The film was so different yet excellent and you could feel what Jesus was going through. not just physically but emotionally and psychologically too. The film is basically about the last 12 hours leading to Jesus' death but there are a lot of messages portrayed in this film. It's one of those films where you watch and analyse for yourself. This film really makes you think and is so challenging not just for the Christian but for everybody. When the film was over none of us could speak. I was just in floods of tears. This is a warning to all mankind that Jesus is coming back soon....we don't when but he is so we all need to fix up and realize that life is not just on Earth here. This film is deep and should be seen by all....well done Mel Gibson may God Bless You....."
5,"I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years. I've played 6 strings. 12 strings. bass acoustics and electrics. When it comes to acoustic sound. these strings produce the brightest. clearest sound of any string I've ever used. Some strings have a 'bright' sound and some have a clear. distinct tone - not muted or dull. Still. other strings have a rich. full resonance that carries through a room. This is the only string I've ever used that has all of those qualities. In fact. the first time I put these on my acoustic and went to lead worship at my church. several of the church members commented that my guitar sounded 'better than usual' or 'really good' that day. I've tried some other brands since I found these and always end up coming back to them."
1,"Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected. pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically. these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok. these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years."
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
2,"I bought a sandwich knife years ago. and loved it so much that I wanted another one. I  bought one of these knives and loved it so much that this is my second one.The rubbery substance the handle is made up gives a really secure grip and makes the knife easy to handle. The edge is serrated and will cut through most things that you'd want to cut with a sandwich knife.The blade can hold a lot of jam. mayonnaise. or cream cheese. and lay down a nice thick layer of what you're spreading. but still lets you put a thinner layer if you want.It's the easiest to use sandwich knife I've ever had."
11,"This book is nice because the touch areas are very large. much larger than most touch books on the market.  Two things I don't like...I wish it was longer and had more to touch.  It is about the same length as most touch books out there. though.  My one real complaint is the page with sand.  It talks about the sand being silky on your feet. but the touch part is sandpaper!  How is THAT silky in any way?!  I wish they would have put something else on that page instead.  Overall. it's cute and my 11 month old likes it. which is the most important thing."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
12,"There are at least 5 missions that cannot be completed without joining the forum. then the Creator's Forum. and a lot of research. downloading. etc.  4 of these defective missions were built by 'Bottman'...someone that should definitely find another occupation.BUT...do not waste your time because the missions are incredibly boring and far from challenging.  The ones they label as 'Hard' are as easy as those labeled 'Easy'.  My 6-year granddaughter could do most of them after 15 minutes of instruction.Do not buy this product.  The GFX are circa 2003. the user interface far from intuitive. and the support abysmal. It's a waste of money & time.Too bad.  Ship.sim 2006 was actually better....AND all the missions worked.  Vstep took one giant step backward."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
12,"I live in a neighborhood with around 30 children in it. that all play Nintendo. I love Nintendo to no end but these controllers break easily! That is why so many colors and versions of them are sold! The buttons break easily where they no longer work when pressed. especially the L and R buttons. the directional pad also breaks easily where you press up on the pad and it moves left or you press down and it moves left. Because of the handlebars on the side of the controller. that allows the plastic bends quite easily. I have noticed when children get upset or frustrated with a game they twist those handle bars. causing them to break. bend or crack. However a controller is a controller. but for this price you can find something cheaper that is more sturdy and reliable."
5,"The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument."
12,"This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!"
11,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo. Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from. yeah Amazon!Bananagrams"
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
1,"'Sea Bond' denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste. gel. or powder. the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist. I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case. the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this.

4,"I have no idea how much Hollywood was added to this movie and to what extent the life and times of Ben Carson were glossed over or idealized. What I do know is the movie was emotional. inspiring. powerful and very touching. This is the story of a young boy who overcomes great odds to succeed in life and make a significant contribution to society.It is also a touching story of the love of a mother. her dedication to her two sons and her strong determination to see they had the opportunity to be the very best they could be. This is an excellent movie for the entire family and I strongly recommend it to all."
1,"I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving. For me this was a good value. especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it isn't bad. However. if foul smells bother you. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar. that I cannot take it out of the house.It's effectiveness and ease to take is great. it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS:Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS:Bad flavorBad Smell"
8,"This is a durable and soft plush doggie toy - The dogs have a small basket full of toys. but Lambchop is one of their fav's to pick out of the box and tussle around.Has a couple squeaker's - so if that drives you crazy you may want to consider something different.Lambchop has also been machine washed and dried in the dryer (on low temp) several times and survived just fine.I have even purchased them a replacement for when the old one does bite the dust. they will have another -"
9,"This is a really nice pocket knife. hurry and get one before you come down with scurvy!The next time I buy some oranges I'm going to try out this orange peeler blade.The file is nice and the scissors are noticeably better than on the 58mm (smallest) SAKs. and those scissors aren't even all that bad.I think that this may be one of the best compromises in size vs utility - it is very easy to pocket but comes with some nice tools.It is also not a bad choice to pair with a SAK or multi-tool that doesn't come with scissors."
12,"FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world. in fact. it is my whole world.  I play it everyday. but I was always sad. because I had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss FF 7.  But not anymore!  Now. FF 7 is out on the PC. and you have to buy it at any cost. so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time. the experience that is Final Fantasy 7. on your computer!  Just thinking about it is making me tear up a little.  I promise. you will not be disappointed.  The stunning. gut-wrenching visuals. the passionate. heart-wrenching storyline. the exciting. ball-wrenching combat system. the absolutely awe-inspiring characters...nothing could be more perfect.  You have not lived if you have not played this game."
2,"Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately. Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster.  It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous. so make sure to read the safety precautions. Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity. You cannot open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock. but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.Pros:- Stainless steel. You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years.  We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid.- Although not as cheap as we like it to be. if you compare it to other manufacturers. you still save some money.Cons:- The pressure valve rocker. Other pressure cookers (but more expensive) has a  non-removable pressure valve.  It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise."
8,"Frontline worked fine for a while.  But fleas are like viruses.  If everyone in an area uses the same flea treatment then the fleas learn to tolerate it.  This summer a lot of folks around here started complaining the Frontline no longer worked for them.  Unfortunately. it was true of my dog as well.  She is riddled with fleas within the first week after treatment.  If this happens to you I recommend using a cheap Nitenpyram pill.  You can get them on Amazon.  One pill will kill pretty much every flea on your dog. but it only lasts a day. But it will give you time to find another treatment that will work before you house gets overrun.  Lets hope you never get the Super Fleas!"
10,"I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2' drill.  I like this drill because its rpm's match its purpose.  I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill. contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill."
1,"I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It's alcohol-based. but I'm surprised it doesn't sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big. I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day. a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)"
5,"I originally purchased these strings because of the 11-52 gauges. I wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around 12-54. Upon installing these strings. I can't really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge. but maybe it's too small to notice with the naked eye. I'm not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old DAddario strings that they replaced. They might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new. The guitar that I'm using them on. is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway. so everything sounds nice and smooth. Overall. I'm satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings. but I don't think I'm ready to give up DAddarios yet."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
6,"I got this new mouse pad/wrist rest when I got my new trackball mouse. I had read the reviews and I was impressed by the reviews that said the gel did not compress like the foam types.So far. my expectations have been met. The wrist rest is comfortable and it does not compress like my old foam one did.Being as I use a trackball. I did have one problem. My trackball mouse slid all over the pad when I pressed a button. I would expect that to be good news for people who use the traditional roll around type of mouse.My solution was to buy a set of those round non-slip jar openers for the kitchen. One of them under my mouse completely solved the slipping problem.I like this mouse pad/wrist rest so much that I bought a gel pad wrist rest for my keyboard. They are both great!"
12,"Originality 10/10 Unlike nearly all other RPG franchises. this is 100% original!Graphics 9+/10 Some Pokemon look better than others.Music 9.5+/10 The music is very good.Replay value 10/10 Even if you get through this game in hours. you may have more to do.Pokemon Red sold 4.83 million in the United States. so this qualifies as an underrated game. due to selling under 5 million units. If you want to buy the best Game Boy game ever. this is where you will find it. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS! This should have gotten a 'Game Of The Year' reward or two. but this (near) perfect masterpiece NEVER got it. A true Pokemon fan has this gem in his/her collection. However. one thing. Some of these might be worn out (discolored label. multiple scratches on the back. etc.) due to being so great of a game. Don't say I didn't warn you."
12,"This is the best fighting game I've ever played and best for multiple players.  There are 8 regular characters plus 4 secret ones. each with over a dozen different moves.  There are 8 regular battle arenas (themed after the 8 characters) and 1 secret one.  Starting with three basic moves and playing with another novice. you can master all of the characters and all of their moves.  This game is unfortunately rigidly divided by skill. and good players will consistently beat worse ones.  I recommend this for everyone. especially those who enjoy games that require quick descisions."
11,"This is a pretty fun group game. but can drag a bit with multiple players. This is because people want to calculate their moves on the board before committing to the best possible route.  A fun variation we like to play is that when you start your turn. you declare your gear and then roll.  Once you roll. you 'drive' the car the necessary moves.  No take backs. no do overs.  This encourages players to pay attention to their car when it is not their turn. and also adds and element of hazard that would be present in a real driving\racing situation.  Makes a good party game. but you may want to limit games to one lap per game."
6,"How bad can a mouse pad be?  That's what I thought....First. be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad.  Basically. it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32' foam pad.  Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads. but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides. and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad isn't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it.  It is very distracting.Finally. the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it.  VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles. so 2 stars."
6,"There is no doubt that more people are choosing to get mobile phones for whenever they need to call up. as well as cordless phones for mobile use at home. But there are still those of us whom would just rather prefer the need of just having a simple phone for one place in the house to call. That is the case with AT&T;'s 210 Corded Phone. This is a very simple and easy to use phone that works for just about anyplace in the house. where you want to keep your calls stationery. I also found it to be very easy to read and understand. and rings louder than my cordless handsets in need of a call to home. If you really are looking for a extra phone for the home or the office. than I definitely recommend this classic phone from AT&T.;Price: B+Convience: BOverall: B 1/2+"
11,"Party Gras is a great party game.  Players can range from teens to lively adults.  The game comes packaged in a clear. durable plastic tote bag versus the typical game box.  The plastic case makes it easy to transport from one party to the next.  The bright. festive. eye-catching colors is what drew me to this game.  I think that most groups of 4 or more will enjoy playing this game if the participants are outgoing and have a good sense of humor.  This game is not for introverts or for someone seeking a high educational value from a game.  Party Gras is a great ice breaker. good humorous family/friend fun. and a welcomed change from board games that keep you seated.  Start the holidays and new year off with something different...Party Gras.  If you tire of this game. just find another person that likes games and do an exchange."
9,"These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself. I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid's sized. but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing. The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight. and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically. The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an 'okay' job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents. I'll never be buying these again. nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children....(in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them.)"
10,"I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting. They are used in the under-cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter. About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs. This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably (lower currents in the system means less wear and tear. so the speak). But they still burn out. These bulbs are a perfect replacement. They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs. but the difference is barely noticeable. I give them a thumbs-up."
9,"I've had experience with Victorinox Swiss Army knives for over 40 years.  My primary casual pocket knife has been the Swiss Army 'Mechanic' for over 20 of those years.  I've always been satisfied with the quality. and with the fine edge you can achieve with the Victorinox stainless steel.  This knife is no exception. Same fine quality.  A little large to comfortably carry in my pocket. but a problem easily remedied with the available Victorinox Cordura Belt Pouch for Swiss Army Knives. Two of the most useful features of this knife are the scissors and the pliers.  Of course you also have the available screwdrivers. as well as all the other features.  It's amazing how handy this knife has been.  There have been times. when I don't have the knife with me. that I find myself reaching for it to perform a certain task. and then. &#34;Drats. I wish I had it with me.&#34;"
10,"I've used the Jorgensen Bar Clamps for years. Bought some other clamps as they were cheaper.  Over the years I know when I am picking up a Jorgensen Clamp.  Fit and finish does well in my workshop which rusts tools! Needed a good vise. It was highly rated and I am impressed by the company. Have yet to install it but it looks well made and it is sturdy.Down side is they need to have a better set of instructions. Can't find anything when I Google it. Some You Tube Videos by ambitious woodworkers. but companies should be doing it!"
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
6,"I haven't used this a lot yet. but. based on my fairly small sample of experience. this product is a lot stronger than other mounting tape I've tried.  We used it putting up posters at a fundraising event and it did an outstanding job - even on a brick wall.  It gripped the wall and the posters very well.  It didn't take a great deal of length to hold bulky and moderately heavy posters.  Pretty much exactly what you're looking for from a product like this."
6,"These are general use return address/locate labels. 2 inch by 4 inches.  I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers. so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And. of course. Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning. so you can not loose buying these.  And the TrueBlock really works.  I took one of the blank labels and pasted it on the dark blue folder the lables come in.  No blue shows through. it is pure white.."
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
6,"Packaging says that the mouse pad is 50% pre-consumer recycled content. and that the packaging card is 100% post-consumer recycled material.Seems like a decent mouse pad and it'll fit my needs. I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently. I don't mean to slight a product because of it's color. but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey."
3,"During the wholes series I was and I am a fan of DJ. I love the way she treats her friends and helps them. Even love her bad habbits :-).What I did not like was the way this story was going. Quinn isn't able to stand a woman. who is standing on her own feet and not fearing to fight for herself? Does he really need to make her small to fell great. feel like a man?For me this book is pushed high. You must know Susan Mallory offers her readers in the US free books 14 days before publishing and they have to write a review to be in the next round for a free book."
8,"I have an 8-pound toy poodle whose passion is fetching balls.  Her mouth is so small she could not get the regular chuckit ball in her mouth and carry it very far.  I ordered this mini-chuckit and though the ball is a little bigger than her very small balls. it works fine and she catches it in her mouth as it's heading toward earth. I have noticed that this mini-chuckit hurles the ball much farther than the regular. which is great because she loves to go far to fetch it.  We use this launcher several times a day and we never get tired of it.  The ball it came with got trashed within a month so I bought Tuff Balls to replace it.  We absolutely love this launcher.  It's fabulous for the beach.  You can't go wrong with this if your little toy dog loves fetching."
1,"We have 3 of these. and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to. and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory. but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best. as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things. so while I preach 'pack light'. they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately. one charge lasts at least a week. so the charging base is only needed on extended trips."
11,"I don't know why my expectations were so low on this product. Frankly. I've been playing RPGs since I was 14 which would be the summer of 1979. Back then RPGs products were crap. I recently decided it would be fun to play some of these games again so I picked up this because I really liked the theme of it and the videos FFG did really won me over. Overall this screen is well made (boardgame quality construction for the screen) and the content of information on it is perfect for anyone not familiar with the conventions of this game which will be about 90% of their customers since so much of it appears to be new.If you have an android device or iOS get the FFG dice roller as well. Its MUCH cheaper than the physical dice!Star WarsTM Dice"
1,"I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy. wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation. itching. skin staining. clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again. it's just wasting money."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
10,"I've had the opportunity to use many different belt sanders over the years. This one is hands down the best one you can buy. Superb engineering. and design. coupled with flawless manufacturing produces this gem. You simply can't go wrong with this sander. I especially like the variable speed feature. This thoughtful feature makes it possible to adjust your at load speeds which helps with softer material. An architect friend and I have used these sanders on many materials including wood. The 3X21 model is this boys little brother. which I found to be a benefit when I need to work upside down. If you're looking for a belt sander. this one will keep you happy."
5,"I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables.  If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound. this might not be the cable for you.HOWEVER. for the price and purpose this a five star cable.  The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection. but also feel sturdy and secure.  The gold plating ensures a solid connection.What I like most about this cable is that it's guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement... or so their packaging claims.  I have not had to replace mine."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
11,"The kids love this guy BUT the programing is not easy. The buttons are a little bit tricky to press and for my 8 year old. it was confusing. Once I programmed it. we had a good time with it. It is great for talking about measuring and basic ideas of computer programing. If only you could program it from a PC... seems like it would not be too difficult to add a USB interface of some kind.If I could give 3.5 stars I would. If it was a little less difficult. it would get 5 stars. For a 10-12 year old. it may be just right."
9,"In my humble opinion. the best supertool around. and I own probably two dozen of them that I've collected over the years. The tool exhibits a fit and finish better than anything else out there. and one great feature is that the tools fold out from the outside of the handle. It featured a positive locking mechanism when most of the other tools still had yet to offer it. including the famous Leatherman. Even with all the innovative multitools of recent years with each new one trying to outdo the other. this took remains head and shoulders above the rest. Next to this. as with a previous reviewer. I would rate the Leatherman Supertool as best."
1,"For most people. that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector). you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life. so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe. and feel like a big spender."
5,"This case it built really well. it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck. it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe."
5,"I've used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel. sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you can't go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them."
10,"I use this tool weekly and it's well made as most Dewalt tools are.  This saw can be found elsewhere including the stand for less money.  A MAJOR FAULT in the design of this tool is when you go to switch blades or reposition the blade whole doing delicate scroll work is that the arm will not stay up and you have to find a 2x4 or something to hold it in the up position!!!  I have heard that there is some sort of retrofit available to solve this problem but can't find it.  Otherwise this is a great tool!"
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
6,"I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back. I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits (you know. the ones with the syringes?). Both ruined my printer. after awhile. They seem to work initially. but you can tell the colors are off. Sure. the generic inks are so much cheaper. but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink. Trust me on this one. buy Canon OEM cartridges!"
1,"I had the older version of this from a couple of years back. and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband. and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one. and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid. though. it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions."
10,"Bought this router with the idea of using it in a table exclusively. I Figured it would be too heavy for using it without a table. but I was wrong: the smooth slowstart feature and the router having no vibration makes it easily controlled.I did end up mounting it in a table and it works great with large style and rail cutters.I compared this against the larger DeWalt. but this one won based on price. As to performance. they are probably equal.If you need a larger router for a good price. get this one."
1,"What can I say? Metemucil works. not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels. Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly. it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF. has no MSG or related products or aspartates."
10,"Replaced my standard router base with this D-handle for better control when routing dovetails using a dovetail jig. Just one thing to keep in mind is the cord on a standard base 690 is too long for use with this handle. There is no good way to manage the extra cord so I shortened my cord on the router and will use an extension cord if I need to use the fixed base again. It was easy to remove the cover on the router and shorten the cord or you could just cut the cord to length and add a new plug if you are nervous about getting inside the router."
6,"This is 200 sheets of wide rules filler paper.  It has three holes punched for your binder.  The lines don't fade or smudge as some lesser filler papers are prone to do.  It is crisp. clean. white. smudgeproof. and looks and performs like the best papers in the world. at a reasonable price.  I like to get 200 sheets in a package as this is a generous size but not so much that I have to store a lot of excess paper on a shelf where it can get dusty.  Mead makes great office supplies from the ones I've been seeing lately."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"I love power ! This tool delivers boat loads of it. But you know what ? It doesn't sound like it. I was never able to use a belt sander before without earplugs. This one runs at only 84 Db. It's the quietest on the market. It's also the smoothest I've used.I've used all of the 4x24 sanders and the Makita just seems to do more work faster. Maybe it's the fact that it has the highest speed of any . maybe it's the high tech . powerful motor .the efficient drive train. Whatever it is . it kicks butt . The dust collection system is also top notch. For small jobs and fine work . I prefer my Bosch 1274 dvs. It's much lighter .compact and easy to control. For extended use or heavy sanding though . you cannot beat this tool."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
3,"K.A. Mitchell is my favorite M/M author. her ability to create realistic characters is amazing.  I love that in this story both men would be what I would call Alpha types. even though it's primarily Jeff in charge. Ryan also steps up.  Very realistic storyline. Jeff can't let out that he's gay for fear of losing the time he has with his daughter. Ryan was in the Air Force so he's been in that same scenario where he has to hide that part of him. The sex scenes this author writes are incredibly descriptive & erotic; makes me feel a little like a voyeur!I do agree with the other reviewers that the book does end abruptly and hope the story is continued.What I didn't like: 2/3 of the book is the story. the last 1/3 of the kindle book is advertisements for other books to read/buy.  So very short story. but still a great quick read that I feel was worth the price."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
3,"I was eager to read this novel and downloaded it at the time it was 0.99. Big spender I know but I am glad I did not spend more. I was intrigued by the concept and some of the scenes of college life are both surreal and funny. Though that is all the positives I have for this meandering book. I mean there is no Jekyll Hide scenario. no ON/OFF if you will. Its like the whole book is more off than on. there is one speed and it is slow. Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective. but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny. but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me."
3,"Recently stating that I very seldom find a 5 star book. I have now read 2 in a row. Naturally I'm pleased! I have read Stephanie Bond before but nothing as good as this book. Hero is reviewing a hotel recently bought by a big corporation. He stays at the hotel without the manager's. Cindy aka heroine. knowledge. HILARIOUS happenstances start on the first page and continue throughout the book. Cindy is hard working. lovable. and accident prone; but a good hotel manager. Eric (hero) is there to do a hatchet job on the hotel. he's crazy about the heroine and wants to pad the report. but does not. Chemistry is great between the H/h.... naturally needed in a good romance. and the humor is top notch. Great..Great..Read. I highly recommend this book and I thank Ms. Bond for the entertainment."
1,"I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily.  Once she tried it. there was no other alternative that worked as good for her (she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin. or left a rash).  This soaks in quickly. doesn't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night (she bumps into anything & a bruise starts. Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either doesn't happen or it fades away in a couple days).Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts. when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face (yes. just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large. angry acne marks are gone).This stuff works quickly on pain. doesn't stain. is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product."
3,"Some editing issues and odd word usage... also a little contrived and heavy handed in spots.That said. despited a feeling of redundancy. I very much enjoyed this bundle as well as the fourth book. Dark Wolf Rising.HOT! HOT! HOT! Even if most of it is all tease! lolThese stories definitely got my motor running.I liked the characters. and the sub-plot running throughout the four books (though it was less of a factor in the fourth book.)The resistance/aversion push/pull is an effective device but I would have liked a bit more variation. One slightly annoying feature was how often a character decided to &#34;Go for it&#34; only to NOT go for it shortly thereafter.Still... I enjoyed them."
4,"There is nothing 'real' or 'realistic' about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie. It is. quite simple. an orgiastic celebration of pain and suffering. See the bad guys sneer and laugh as the blood splatters their faces with full Dolby sound effects! In many ways the violence in 'Kill Bill' is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?). this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience. For the time capsule called. 'The Dumbing of America.' save room for this ridiculously overblown religious treatise that cheapens. not celebrates. the life of Christ. Pure drivel."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
4,"WOW this is a DVD?!?The show is as it was in the TV release and the extras do bring it to the modern day but I think they (Sony Wonder/Golden Books) could have packed all the shows on One DVD instead of making you buy  3 of them... Look to Warmer Bros. Year w/o Santa Claus...Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Frosty could have made it all in this DVD... Well I got it in the collection and saved some over buying them one at a time...Enjoy the show and worry where the popcorn money will come from later..."
5,"I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily. Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn't get tripped over or dinged. Enter the String swing.I have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble.The Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster. Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it's own center of gravity.The base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory. I didn't use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs.These are well worth the cost."
3,"This is the story of Devin. a skittish diva who is running from love and Erik. the man hell bent on chasing her crazy behind until she admits she loves him and is ready to move their relationship to the next level. I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin. afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived. is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest. most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries! Have your little black book handy. you might need to call in reinforcements LOL!!!"
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
8,"Ok So I have used this product for the past two months and it is not working. I don't know why. it appears to be in the exact same box as the one you would get from your local vet. I know it says it takes at most 18 hours to take affect. Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me. I am not happy about this at all. I only paid about $20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office. WHAT'S THE DEAL????Is this S*** fake ?????????????????I don't usually do reviews if the product is good. but when it is bad I do because I don't want anyone else wasting their money!!!JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS. For some unknown reason this just isn't working and I am frustrated."
10,"I don't know why I waited so long -- I purchased this to do my basement -- makes doing any sheetrock job -- especially ceilings -- exceedingly easier than doing it the old way with a cordlesss drill and dimpler bit.It takes a little practice to get used to how fast you can work with this. but even taking your time loading screws. it sets them at a perfect depth everytime which saves a HUGE amount of time in the long run when mudding.I'm holding back 1 star to see how well the tool holds up over time. but 25% of the way into my basement project. I'm extremely pleased with its performance."
11,"I am really enjoying playing this game. When I first heard about descent they were no longer in print. Later hearing about the second edition I was very excited.The production is excellent and the rules although a bit much at first are quite easy to learn. They are even easier to teach to someone. Weapons. spells and overload powers are really fun. The art work on the tile sets allows you to be fully taken into the experience.Games are also around an 1-2 hours and are nicely broken up into two acts for making it easier for groups with time constraints.If you are into dungeon board games. then his is for you."
11,"This game is really fun. and not that difficult to learn. Only takes a couple of games to figure it out. and the games are usually less than 30 minutes.The game is 2 player. and it has a defense / offense type strategy with the corporation being the defensive player trying to score agendas. and the hacker being the offense player trying to hack and steal the agendas. There is also an element of deck building.Very fun. would recommend buying some sleeves to protect the cards. Can't wait to check out the expansions."
11,"I like the Scene It games pretty much. The premise is similar to a Trivial Pursuit type of experience. but with 2 changes. One. all ages can play (with an older helper to read. use the remote. etc.) and two. the 'questions' sometimes involve watching a 'scene' (hence the name Scene It!!) and answering questions about that.The kids think that the dvd part is amazing! They love watching the scene and trying to guess what the question might be. I think it is kind of cool myself! Still. sometimes the game gets slightly long for younger children. My family does have fun playing this game. but it is one where you don't want to immediately play over again when it is done."
11,"This kit is really cool.  It comes with little tracer designs and a backup LED light so you can place all your parts where you want them and then trace your design.  Then you can finish up with cool colors. accents. details. etc.  You can make anything from a family SUV-type to a racecar to a Bug to everything in between.  My kid spent days taking personal requests and then lovingly designing a custom car for everyone in the family.  The final results are very high-quality too!  I definitely recommend this pack."
3,"I was not disappointed. sometimes sad. sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages. I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past. but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale. a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and can't wait to start on them. (I went for the freebies so don't know how the 3.00 plus books would be.) formating.english etc. may be better."
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
4,"Although I will never watch it again. I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie.  It accurately portrays Jesus' last tortured hours on planet earth.  I give kudos to Gibson. who was brave enough to finance this movie himself. amidst much controversy.  I would encourage all to watch this movie. at least one time. to understand why throughout the ages. thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ.Yes. this movie is violent. but this world is violent. and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world. but to share in our sufferings."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
8,"I have tried numerous bones and chew toys without success. My 90 lb Lab/Pit mix is a heavy chewer who has destroyed just about everything I gave him. Even the heavy rubber Black Kong Extreme he was able to conquer. I ordered the Galileo Bone based on many positive reviews. Initially I thought the price was high. $14.00 bucks for a dog bone? This thing is huge and will outlast 10 cheaper ones. My dog loved it! It has a chicken flavor that made it irresistible. He chewed it for over an hour straight barely making a mark in it. This bone will last a long time and is worth the price."
1,"Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!"
6,"FIrst. before you order these. pay attention to the dimensions listed in the description.  These are RETURN address labels -- the small ones you stick in the corner of the envelope -- NOT the usually-larger address labels that contain the address where you want your letter to go.  They are. therefore. SMALLER than address labels.  Don't order these expecting to get larger labels.  :-)That said. these are excellent quality. print easily in my inkjet printer. and. as the package says. are easy to peel off the backing sheet.  I used one of the templates I got from the Avery website (I'm on a Mac. using Microsoft Word for the Mac). and designed some nice-looking labels.  Don't expect to fit more than 3 lines of small print on each label.  Like I said. these are small."
10,"I bought the Bosch belt sander because. at the time. it had the best warranty. I planned to sand all the peeling paint off my 1 1/2 story clapboard house and repaint it. I thought that I'd go through at least two of these sanders. I bought the belts by the case and spent several weeks sanding the house. I'd run this thing until it overheated and stopped. I'd let it cool down and go at it again. To my surprise. I completed the job and the original Bosch sander was still working good as new. I later found out that this sander is good for more delicate work. I have more control and it seems to lay flatter. It eventually died (smoke poured out of the motor)and I replaced it with a Makita sander. a very robust and dependable unit. Over all. I'd prefer the Bosch for finer finishing work and ease of use."
6,"The best way to go with these business cards is to download the free Avery Design Pro software. Using this program. one can create a wide variety of business cards to satisfy virtually anyone.These cards do have a matte finish which is more conservative in appearance than the glossy or semi-glossy stock that is also available from Avery. They take color nicely and look very professional with their smooth edge.The cards break loose easily and dry quickly. It is usually wise to let them sit for a few minutes before stacking them.I am very pleased with the business cards that have been produced from this product and can recommend them to anyone wanting to exercise creativity in the design of their business cards."
9,"I think Casio under prices this watch. I have purchased watches from Nike and some of the other expensive brands and this Casio is still my favorite. The low profile makes it wearable every day. It says it is water resistant. but I have gone to the lake and swimming with this watch and never had any water issues. The back light is not as bright as some other brands but I am glad it is not because this helps the battery last longer and it is bright enough to see it. The watch is very user friendly for first timers. You can not beat a watch like this. especially when it is a quarter of the price of other watches."
11,"We got this for our family for Christmas and it was great. The game has a similar feel to Settlers. but isn't quite as cut-throat. so it's easier to get through a game without people feeling frustrated at each other. I can see why this game has won so many awards. I also love that it comes with three extra train pieces of each color so to account for pieces ever getting lost. The only thing we didn't like was that all the cards are very small (about 2 1/2&#34; tall) making it very hard to shuffle them)."
9,"First off. these amplify ALL sounds. so they are useless in a factory where there are constant noises echoing from a distance.When I walk on concrete. my FOOTSTEPS get isolated by these headphones. and the phones mute for almost a half second EVERY step. I cant even hear myself walk WITHOUT these on. They are hot and not exactly UNcomfortable. but you feel much better NOT wearing them.To top it off. I got it at the last GoldBox deal. and I was *NOT* sent the '7S' model I paid $99.99 for. I was sent this 6S model that retails for exactly $79 on Amazon. and I didnt notice until 5 weeks later."
10,"I mainly purchased these to replace the standard thrust washer that came with my tablesaw. So with that in mind. they work great.  As for the stabilizer part. I don't think they add much for standard kerf blades. or at least I don't notice any  appreciable difference.  I don't use thin kerf blades as a general rule so I can't speak to their usefulness while using thin kerf blades.I hadn't really intended on using both pieces when I ordered them. again intended to replace the thrust washer. One added benefit that I didn't think about is that it shifts the blade over. in my case. to the right.  Now I can reuse some of my old chewed up zero clearance inserts!I do only use the outside stabilizer with my dado set."
9,"I didn't buy the scope for the case or the stand I was looking for a good mid-range spotting scope that is what my review is for. I shoot 100yds. with a marlin wmr 22 and I can see my shots on paper very good.I also shoot a Savage axis at 200 yds. and can still see my holes in targer. for someone that does bird watching or simular hobbies this is a very good scope for the price. I could read the lettering on a building that was at least 1200 yds. away 12' letters."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"My Porter-Cable gets a lot of use and the pad will eventually loose it's &#34;grip&#34;.  When using the sander one should not use excessive pressure as I think this is the reason the pads will fail after about a year of heavy use.  Believe it or not. I get impatient and apply too much pressure which I believe develops excessive heat causing the velcro to fail.  When this happens. the sand paper will only loosely attach only to fly off.  Then it is time to put on a new one.  For the price of a replacement. I'll gladly fork over the dough to get away from the old stick backed sanding discs."
8,"Are you sick and tired of picking up slobbery. wet. drool dripping tennis balls? Then the answer to your problems is in the Chuck It. I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog. It's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground. It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it didn't just fly into the ground (I put too much arm swing into it). This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean. The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also. depending on the size of your dog. It also comes in a variety of colors. Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them!If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls. or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you!"
5,"This is actually the first capo I have ever owned. as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. That being said. I paid close to $14 with free shipping for this capo. and I feel it is a good value. It feels well constructed. like it won't break if I drop it. The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings. Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar's neck. The spring mechanism is plenty tight. but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed. even while playing. The capo is sleek looking. and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3&#34; x 3&#34;. but I have no frame of reference for comparison.Item was shipped on time. and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging. Part number: 83CB. Made in USA! No counterfeit here. If you have any questions. feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO"
6,"If the size is very important for you. check the photo of the box first. The description by Amazon lists these as 1-1/4. however the box actually lists 1-1/16.Even then. really the usable size is closer to just 1'.We needed super large clips at the office. and measured that 1-1/4 would be just perfect. however with the actual usable bit measuring in at 1'. we're having some problems making them work.Granted. they do work great. but the item description was misleading online. and the actual stated capacity is also stretching it a little.Durability is great as usual. though unusual warping may occur due to the larger size. Harder to open to the full 1' size."
9,"This is great for baking it just takes some getting used to.  Cookies and turnovers get over cooked unless turned.As for the reviewers who complain about the handle getting hot.  Just buy the lodge signature series with stainless handles (it only costs 5 to 10x as much) or buy a good oven mitt or two.Obviously several of the reviewers are illiterate as they didn't read the care instructions.  But to be fair Lodge doesn't say that you really need to boil water in the pan and then wpie with oil and heat before using.  The pre-seasoning only shortens the seasoning process. it DOES NOT REPLACE SEASONING!"
4,"ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has beendeemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to seemalice where none exists.Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows ofthose with the same mentality as the book-burners of1930's Germany.Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian 'Newsspeak' toedit our past? Come on... this IS a cartoon. for Pete'ssake. NOT some social/political statement.Nothing here needs to be edited or 'cleaned up'. Theseare simple 'good vs. evil' stories with a happy ending.and should be offered in their entirety... music/songs.credits and all.And. if one is offended by ANY of this... then one mayexorcise one's freedom NOT to purchase such!Nuff' said..."
1,"I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again. we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them. definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!"
10,"This product is almost exactly the same as the Ryobi BE231 it replaced. Externally the primary difference is a carbon pad to reduce frction on the Bosch. The Bosch cost twice as much. and became nonfunctioinal after little use. while the Ryobi model withstood heavy use for years. There was so much friction on the carbon pad. that it heated up painfully. The sander started breaking belts for no apparent reason. The dust collection on the Ryobi was not good. but it was totally nonfunctional on the Bosch.I have been satisfied with the Bosch routers (1613.1617). but their sanders. both belt and ROS. have not worked well for me."

1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
9,"All natural. does not polute. no chemicals on your skin. all natural. So natural you can brush your teeth with it! It has been a favorite of us backpackers for years and only a few drops will usally do the job. I have tried the Almond. Citrus. Eucalyptus.Tea Tree. and Peppermint. My favorite is the Peppermint which leaves you tingling and smells great. and taste's allot better than the others for brushing your teeth. If used right a bottle will last a very. very. long time. You can also wash clothes. dishes. whatever. with it. There are several stories about it and its creator on the web. A peculiar history for a great product. that is still made by the same family operation.I started by just using it for backpacking and now get it to use at home too."
3,"I loved this shorter story about Zadist. Bella and Nalla. I had no idea that they were having troubles in their marriage. I couldn't believe that things almost didn't work out for them. My heart was breaking for Bella and Nalla. and Zadist too because of everything that he was going thru. It's like a normal every day marriage - there was lack of communication and I was so happy that during the read they were able to figure out what they needed to figure out. talk about what they needed to talk about. and work it out. Oh I just love the whole series and can't wait for March 2013. Once again J R Ward outdid herself with this short story about the now happy lil perfect family!"
4,"I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT!!!!"
11,"THis game only got 4 due to the luck factor.  No matter how well you play. you could just draw bad cards everytime.  That is it.  Other than that. this is a wonderful. wonderful game.  This IS the perfect game to get people into Eurogames like Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.  Easy to explain - 5 minutes tops.  Fast to play - 1 hour.  Good strategy.  Good theme.  You even feel like you are being educated at least a little bit in the area of US geography.Bottom Line:  Best family board game in existance.  Anyone can learn to play it relatively quickly."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows. I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product.  My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it.  In a last ditch attempt. I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral.  Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly (and yes. I am a lady)and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now.  You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated.  My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have.  I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up.  It also doesn't dry out my skin like other products.  Definitely a keeper!"
3,"Esme is abused by her father after her mother leaves them.  Seeking a way out she is going to marry until she realizes the man is just as awful (and as old as) her father.  When she witnesses the scene across the street she decides that Captain Radwell is the man to ruin her and get her away from her father.  What she doesn't count on is the honorable streak that he is trying to have.  He delivers her to his brother and his wife for help.  And then he sticks around.  Great read!"
5,"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop. the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway. I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack. don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise. I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!"
10,"Bought a box of this to go with my PC 343 sander. Don't make the same mistake as I did. The PC 343 is 8 hole. This sandpaper is 5 hole!But other than my mistake in ordering it. I have used it with the PC343 and it sands and sands and sands! The paper is heavyweight and last a lot longer than what I was using with my C-backed 3M sander. Picks up dust reasonably well considering I am only using approx 2 or 3 out of the 5 holes. Probably the best sand paper I have used in a long time.Price is alright if you are buying just one box. I have found suppliers selling it for $16 for all grits. If plan on getting several boxes or the higher grits. it is available from other online suppliers for $16 a box (Plus $6 shipping). Just do some surfing. you may get better deals from time to time with store promotions."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
11,"Unlike a lot of games I've gotten for my daughter. Qwirkle was one I was not familiar with from having playing it as a child. Not sure if it was around back then. or if it's just a modern version of a classic concept (like dominoes perhaps?). All I know is that I love playing it and so does my almost-six year old daughter. And the cool thing is we can each play at our own level and still play together. I don't have to &#34;dumb down&#34; my playing at all. And she never has to feel like I'm letting her win. Her moves have surprised and challenged me just as often as the other way around. Not many games like that. are there? Highly recommend."
4,"This sensational DVD. culled from a TV show I have cloudy memories of from my youth. presents Andy Kaufman in a way that surpasses the Milos Forman biopic (not to denigrate Jim Carrey's outstanding performance) and the  A&amp;E Biography. You get it all here. and it's mostly hilarious. Best of  all is Mr. Kaufman's dead-on Elvis impersonation...his choice of songs is  impeccable--&quot;Too Much&quot; is an Elvis hit that Mr. Presley seldom  performed live. Great introduction (or reintroduction?) to this fascinating  character."
11,"I appreciate the materials used to create this puzzle and our three year-old loves the picture that is formed when the puzzle is complete. Soy inks + recycled cardboard = Wonderful.I have only one criticism. and it's a minor one. Since the puzzle is intended for a younger audience. it might be nice if the pieces were a bit thicker. Our son has good fine motor skills. but the pieces can still bend and crease as he works to fit them together. With that said however. the creasing may be due more to his impatience when the pieces don't seem to fit right than with the build quality of the puzzle."
10,"This tool does everything the manufacture says it does and does it well.  No wonder many magazines have made it their &quot;Editor's Choice&quot;.I don't understand the negative reviews.  I have experienced none of the problems some people have mentioned.  Maybe a person needs to be smarter than the tool.  I make my living with a plate joiner doing plastic laminate countertops and it has been flawless.  I've used tools costing much more with no improvement in results.The only place I might take away a half star would be since the fence is so precise you wouldn't want to turn it over to an employee who would drop it on a concrete floor.  Other than that I don't know how you would improve upon it."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
10,"Product works as advertised but  the run-down test on a new Lithium battery was a bit disappointing.  With frequent power outages. I want a light that will last a long time.  I turned around and purchased the LED bulb kit and resolved this as an issue.The provided bulb's brightness was mildly disappointing.  The LED is brighter but does not throw as wide a beam.But if you add the cost of the floodlight ($35) + LED kit ($25) . it's a bit pricey."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
3,"As a stand-along book. I really enjoyed The Twelve Lies of Christmas. although it didn't have as much of a holiday theme as the title would indicate.The main characters were engaging. if a bit under-developed and the story was fast-paced and kept my interest throughout the story. The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series. I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand. I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha. I can't imagine that their lives would become less exciting that they started in this book."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
5,"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal. it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot. so I had that replaced. but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product. but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had."
1,"This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this."
1,"While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands. I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience. as it depends what you use them for. but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year. so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand."
8,"This 'wiggly giggly' ball was very disappointing.  I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective. which of course amazon was quick to replace.  The second one came and was no better than the first one.  It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person. but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog. it went mute.  He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back.  I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $12. I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball."
3,"The WSJ for Kindle is overpriced. and the customer service has gone completely haywire since the newspaper was bought out.  I have read and subscribed by Kindle. print edition. and iPhone app (WSJ Mobile).  Unfortunately. they are all horrible in contebt delivery--even though the writing is still superb--and try calling them.  10 minute waits to speak to someone in a different country who will put you on hold. and then when you try to cancel. it is abysmal.  More waiting.  I will never be part of WSJ Online. pinrt. Mobile or Kindle after my recent experiences.  Again. the company has been bought out and is now on its way out.  Beware."
8,"Ok. I don't own this. but have thought about it. After discovering arm and hammer cat box deodorizer...I can live without the littemaid. I buy cheap litter because I've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage. I keep the box. garbage bags. the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer. I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter. Try this. if you are leary of buying the litter maid.  I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing!"
1,"Bought 3 packs. prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each. but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW. it is true that the description is misleading. the batteries I received are alkaline. not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices. but for toys and flashlights. alkaline is a better value."
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.  Along comes Leo looking for a job but before he can apply he sees Lisa and she sees him.  Old lovers who forgot why they were no longer together.  Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
5,"Ever since I started playing the guitar. I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with. but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them. as you can get them at your local music store for about that."
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
6,"The Swingline Classic Cut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer is exactly what it says. it's LIGHT. and it cuts very well.  The lightness of the product does make it feel a bit cheap. but I think it will hold up just fine....it's a desktop item. not something you're going to throw around or jump on!There are two sets of measuring guides. on at the top of the cutter and another about 5 inches down which is kind of nice. the entire bed of the cutter it filled with grids so it's easy to make sure that your paper is lined up straight. very useful for cutting smaller items.I am very happy with this cutter. a great replacement for my old heavy elephant of a cutter. definitely worth it!"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
4,"What an encouraging story!  With all the odds against him. Dr. Carson came out on top with his faith and the teaching and prayers of his Mom.  If you are a single parent. I highly recommend this movie as a great source of inspiration.  The positive impact of a parent is so dramatically displayed.And if you are into details. be sure to watch the 'extra' information on the making of the movie.  It will really add to your appreciation of Dr. Carson and those who worked so hard to bring his story to life."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
5,"I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough. I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done. this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings. I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
11,"I purchased this game after watching it played on Tabletop on the Geek and Sundry youtube channel.  It can be a little daunting when you first set it up but is easier to play than it looks. I really like that it supports up to 8 players as we have a large group of friends that game together. It can be hard to find good quality games that support more than 4-6 players and many of the ones that do can become tedious waiting for your turn.On our first time playing we got our butts kicked. but we still had a great time."
5,"I never really considered a cheaper cable. I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon. I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise. this is an excellent cable. with good build quality and a strong. thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables. and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm. guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over. try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!"
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
5,"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge. then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most. and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke. and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own. just make sure to not let the sponge drip. ie. wring it out. and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
8,"Shipping was fast. got it within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  Says that it stops all stages of fleas. and kills and protects against chewing lice and ticks as well - I'm not sure about the chewing lice and ticks. but I did find fleas on my Lab puppy when I got him.  I use this on him. and within two weeks I didn't find any on him at all. not even after I bathe him and used a flea comb on him.  Says it works up to a month. and is water-proof.I'd highly recommend."
9,"When I considered returning the compass for smaller ones. I learned that Amazon does not accept returns for this item due to hazardous material regulations.  Not a problem in my case. but thought you'd all want a heads-up before purchasing.I purchased a few of these as additions to emergency kits I built for friends/family (see my Listmania lists).  I planned to make the kits out of Nalgene bottles. but the compass is a little too wide to fit. so instead I made the kits out ofMTM Survivor Dry Box with O-Ring Sealwhich worked out better anyway."
11,"I'll keep it pretty short. If you're considering the expansion. I would hope you already own Last Night on Earth. I think LNOE is a great game that offers suspense. teamwork. competition. and usually a lot of laughs. This expansion does not change much. What it does do is add some more locations (in the form of some new L-shaped boards). some new characters. new hero and zombie cards. and a few new scenarios. On top of that. it comes with new game pieces that are used with the free scenarios available on the games' official website or that can be used to design your own scenarios.In short. this expansion does not reinvent the wheel. What it will do. however. is help expand and reinvigorate an already great game. It's a little pricey. but if you like LNOE. it's a good investment."
9,"this lock is useless on my glock and shotgun and only barely fits very awkwardly on my sig sauer.  it does fit on my ruger revolver but barely too.  it is bulky and you're better off getting a small lock box instead of this.  it may sound good until you try in on and it doesn't fit or barely fit. not to mention it may scratch up the gun.  this claims to fit many or most guns but it doesnt fit the popular ones out there like the ones i have.  what's worse is that the 3rd digit on the combo gets stuck and is difficult to move.  that would totally render this lock totally useless.  it doens't fit and if it does fit it would take you forever just to roll the digits over to your code to unlock it!  overrated lock."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
8,"I adopted Sam from a local shelter.  He had a dull. brittle coat. constant rash and other health issues.  I had him allergy tested and found he was allergic to some 40 foods and environmental allergens.  The allergy testing places compiled a list of dog foods he could eat.  All were expensive ($60+ for a 30lb bag) and hard to find where I live in rural Alaska.  But we love our dogs up here and I found that I could get Avoderm on Amazon for a hair over $40 for a 30lb bag with free shipping.  I haven't made my postman happy. but my dog loves it and I love the price and ease.  Sam can't have potatoes. peas. and a lot of grains. so Avoderm has really changed his life and mine.  Thanks Amazon!"
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"Double bladed. my only gripe is the blade's a tad short. Most manufacturers of great knives don't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges. but SOG. The characteristics of this knife make it a good fighting knife. but a little on the smallish side. Take a look at the Cold Steel Voyager with a 5- or 6-inch blade for not a whole lot more money. Chances are you'll drop this one in a heartbeat.Free shipping on knives would be great. too. but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales. At least on smaller items."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it. I hadn't noticed that in the listing. maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable. my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle. good as new. I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit. I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days. Works a charm on acoustic guitars. haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet."
5,"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works. and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele. and it is easy to add. move. remove. With the trigger-type release. it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards. and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo. Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality. this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended."
9,"Love it love it  love it.I've been needing a camping knife for a while. I already owned several SOG products and have found them to be an acceptable balance of price and quality. This product is no exception. Are their better? Of course! But there are much worse for much more money. as well. THis is an excellent value for an excellent blade that I expect to last forever. Or.  until I give it away / lose it/ abuse it to disrepair. This buy is a no-brainer for anyone in the market for a similar sized blade.The only thing I may--- MAY - have changed. was going for the kydex rather than nylon.... but I do like that the extra storage in the nylon version is perfect for a sharpener or my SOG multitool."
9,"This set is good for the office - and if you have carpet. it would help if you attach some velcro at the ends to make the mat straight. Otherwise the mat is my biggest complaint - it does not straighten out enough. The return mechanism is pretty good. the unit itself feels fairly cheap. My 7 and 10 year olds enjoy it. even set some obstacles to make the course more interesting.As far as using it in the office. I had a few bosses who like to &#34;practice&#34; at the office. and this would be a winner for a birthday gift."
8,"Bought this for our 50-pound dog. for use following surgery. to reduce the risk of post-op hernia.  Trained him on it prior to surgery. since he's used to jumping in and out of the van.  Dog navigated it just fine. even in post-anesthesia haze :-).  Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table.  All surfaces are coated. so there's nothing to scratch the vehicle's paint.  When folded. ramp kept closed with a coil spring. protected with a bit of clear tubing.  Simple solution that works just fine.  Notch in rails well-placed to carrying when folded.  Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp.  Definitely recommend to dog friends."
4,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend in the theaters as soon as it came out.  This is not really a very religious movie. but rather describes the last 12 hours of Jesus before he was crucified.  The content of the movie is very strong though.  Throughout the whole movie. I was bothered by how many times Christ was punished...was just in about every other scene!  I think. that the director(s) abused a little of the punishment. but that's my opinion.  We didn't get to live those times to find out how it really was. but it was very hard. lots of punishment and suffering.It shows clearly all the suffering Jesus went through. and how he stayed strong the whole way.  Like another reviewer mentioned. the Satan character and deamons that haunt Judas were well done.Overall. the movie is very good. with lots of strong & violent scenes and sad moments as well. Go watch it and/or buy it and renew your faith!"
10,"A well engineered product released after they 'got the bugs' out.  Doesn't sound very American.  Jorgensen has a well known reputation and they seem to want to maintain it.  The metal is clean. all parts align and the size and weight are a good mix for most applications.I would only suggest two additional things.  The handle's end caps don't fit well (sometimes).  Do not force them on or they will split.  Lightly taper the handle and either screw. glue or do both. 'J' could send 3 to avoid user problems.  Secondlyly. I would like to 'J' supply a pair of hard wood inserts for the steel jaws.  TJS"
4,"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it. thinking it was a film. not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals. you risk being burned at the stake. an act of love to purify your soul.This film.as a film. disregarding the topic. is a dog. A cheap 'B' grade. blood spurting. flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour. but won't bother."
9,"These don't last long if you sharpen a good deal.  After a couple of months a significant amount of the grit is gone and you have to start seeking good spots on the sharpener. usu. top and bottom.  Same with my Lansky fine sharpener. When the grit goes. the holes (on either) start catching the edge--not good.  Still. even quality stones wear. and as I said. I just bought my 3rd one in 3 years. so there must be something right about it.  Basically. it is quick. gets a good--not great--I use Japanese water stones for my best knives--edge. Frequently. I have had friends admire whatever knife I am carrying and pull theirs out and this enables me to put a quick. easy edge on their blades and hand it back to them. tickled."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
9,"The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad.  Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize.  The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft.  The unit just doesn't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose."
1,"In general. Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox. and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming. i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these. I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case. I will continue to buy online."
5,"At the begining I wasn't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this. so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box. I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals. then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain. so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise!. connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine. I also realized that pedals positions (routing signal) has something to do with it. I couldn't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right. so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it. so it work as it is supposed to."
11,"I'll admit. I like it. we have a 4 and 6 year old and they ate it up.  It made Christmas really fun this year.  Some drawbacks:  1) I got tired of telling them to be good because the elf would tell Santa (do not let this replace real parenting).2) If you are a Christian like I am. you will need to bring the real message of Christmas into this story or it will overshadow it.3) Don't forget to move the thing every night!  Sheesh. my kids thought the elf didn't move because they were so bad the day before. the elf couldn't bear to tell Santa."
1,"They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year. the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite. in the manual that comes with the weather station. recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite. we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far. the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life. except to say that it's at least a year. at least for our type of use."
3,"I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults.  Warning it is a long. involved tale that can't be read in one evening.  Since every character is a man. it is a less than sentimental journey.  Though they are definitely some tearful scenes.  One character is a former slave. but is treated as the others' equal though somewhat condescendedly.  I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone.  And no spoilers. but you may want to read another Verne classic when done with this one..."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
6,"I absolutely love these mailing labels!  They are convenient. and make life so much easier!  These mailing labels are smaller than certain other types of labels; therefore. more labels will fit on each sheet.  And if you use a lot of mailing labels. then that does you a lot of good.They print so quickly and easily.  Whenever you need a label. just peel it off.  These label sheets save a lot of time and energy. and are so neat.Highly recommended if you use mailing labels.And these are for ink jet printers. which is the type of printer I have at home."
11,"I bought this on a whim to play with my D&D; friends when we don't have enough players for our regular game.  It is enjoyable and novel as a result of the clear card format.  The art is interesting and the flavor text on teh cards is great.  I recommend.The loss of the fifth star is largely the result of the cost and the quality of the cards.  My set is a little bit cloudy and they have gotten moderately less clear with minimal use.I also bought the expansion and made identical comments there as well."
1,"First. you don't buy specialized bandages like this very often. I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones. yikes! The adhesive - able to stick for days (thru showers). the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material. the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed. Latex-free and hypoallergenic (I've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids. not just the latex). This stuff blows away other (more recent) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it. Except my surgical tape isn't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes?"
6,"Generally. my main complaint about labels is the poor quality glue that's used and their inability to stick to anything other than a narrow range of paper types. Most Avery labels can stick to a wide variety of materials ranging from paper to pained surfaces to plastic and these are no exception.As advertised. they are very opaque and anything underneath will generally not show through. If you hold the label up to the light. you might be able to make out what was underneath--but otherwise you can't see through it.They feed through printers without issue (even color lasers that may snake the labels through several rollers) and peel of cleanly.Do you need Avery labels for everything? No. not really. But you are definitely getting a better product for the money."
1,"I'm lucky. these are 'cheap' and work great for me; I eat a lot of dairy!I usually eat between one and three with my first bites of dairy. occasionally I've made a mistake and taken after. never have had a problem. knock on wood -funny thing. I live on a dairy farm. and I can drink our raw milk just fine. I need lactaid to eat our aged cheeses and pasteurized milk. I have not tried raw milk ice cream. and our yogurt is fine for me. all yogurt is fine for me ...I'm delighted I can buy this through Amazon. hard to get locally ..."
4,"Did Mel want do resell this video or was it because he wanted the art to speak for itself. then over time say his part?I didn't even know this was out until someone on the radio was discussing watching it. It seems like there was always a 'making of' planned for the DVD but with the controversy surrounding the film. it seems like he put this on the shelf until time had passed by.There was little to no promotion regarding this special edition as I mentioned. so I don't think this was about reselling as it is giving the fans of this film what they want.Time has passed to be able to watch the film. listen to the commentary and now get a peek behind the curtain.Braveheart is still my favorite of his though."
6,"I love making my own greeting cards.  These work perfectly with my canon inkjet printer.I like to take tons of pictures at parties and get togethers.  It is amazing how many funny looking faces some people make while trying to smile for a photo especially a big group.  There will always be one in the middle of doing something else instead of getting the smile right.  I like to take and isolate that one and later for their birthday or something make a funny card.  Or put funny sayings in word balloons over their heads and make a funny card.People like personalized cards and not only that. this is so much cheaper than cookie cutter cards at the store.  My friends all seem to look forward to my cards so I use lots of these Avery Half Fold products."
10,"I've used this for about six months now.  For the price I am satisfied. But you get what you pay for. It required at least an hour to true the sole. clean the paint from certain areas and sharpen the blade. And the blade doesn't seem to hold an edge for a long time. I think I'll ask Santa to put a Lie Neilsen in my stocking this year. For the weekend warrior. this is probably the perfect plane. But beware. the blade needs to be sharpened before use."
1,"I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold. my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it's a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However. for some reasons. it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don't have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning. wash it off by the afternoon. and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face. it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes. shine. oily looking. However. if you don't care too much about your appearance. it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh. did I mention that the price is very reasonable?"
9,"I have an older one and I have to agree with the flaws cited by other reviewers.  The hard plastic wheels are slippery. make an annoying grinding sound. and they ride rough.  The handle is way too short.  I have to hunch over to hold it.  Other less significant problems: the foot rest is too narrow so my 1 year old just drags his feet (2 year old can peddle or push with his feet fine).  The best thing about it is the low seat height (1 year old can climb on easily. not so with Radio Flyer).  It's also not expensive like the otherwise much better-made Kettler.  Between this and the Radio Flyer. we're set until it's time for real bicycles.  Trikes do tip.  I think that's how boys get tough. no?  or at least more careful."
6,"Overall. I'm very satisfied with these.  I originally had thought I'd use them for individual labeling of mail. however. my software doesn't allow for single print of labels.  So. I initially wasted an entire sheet when the address printed on all the labels.So. I've gone to using them for my return labels.  I use a Canon M83 color printer and they come out just fine.  I will say that 'virtually disappear' is a pretty big stretch...to me the labels are still very visible even though they are clear."
9,"Perfect soap for me. It doesn't dry out my skin. its hypoallergenic. it is biodegradable so I can use it while backpacking. it has tons of freaky pseudo-cult stuff written all over it for shower time reading. what more could you want? No weird fragrances means that it is basically just castile soap mixed with peppermint oil. The peppermint oil can be a bit jarring on really cold winter mornings. but it is completely amazing after working out. When you are trying to cool down after a workout. the peppermint oil is so. so nice.Recommend for anyone who likes simple refreshing soap?"
8,"Our German Shepherd. Gabby. is so energetic when we give her these. which is every morning. She does prefer the roasted beef Zuke's better. but loves these. also. The vim and vigor that she gets from these are unbelievable and she is very peppy after consuming the recommended amount. I think highly of this product and believe that the ingredients make a huge difference in the well being of our pup! She is happier. springier. and does not act like an old lady. like she used to! Awesome stuff!!"
9,"I've been using Dr. Bronner's for many decades. It's my favorite camping soap. but is a refreshing wash-up anywhere. I use it to freshen water bottles too. It gets rid of that funny plastic taste and smell. Larger quantities are cheaper than the smaller bottles you might find at your local mountainously overpriced sports stores. I gave it four stars because I do prefer the original formula that was stronger and left a size-able tingle on your skin. but even toned down it's a great soap. I'll continue to buy it."
4,"This one totally bites.  Unless you were born in the 40's this one is completely out of date.  No bite no bang and way too much buck.  The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room.  Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers.  Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot.  If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride.  That's a biker flick.  This is yet another example of how phony the 60's were.  Save your money.  I wish I had."
6,"This is the one.  This is the first all-in-one keyboard cleaning kit I have ever used that really delivers.  The instructions are clear and the tools are high quality.  After using the cleaner for the first time I was amazed that my keyboard (a Logitech ergonomic) looked and felt brand new after I had used dirty fingers to pound out thousands of pages on it.  Don't even bother with searching for another kit.  There is one thing though.  There should be about twice as much of the cleaning solution provided."
3,"I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut. fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author. Mr Camacho. made Hannibal a very human hero. who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!"
11,"Since it was high on the list of popular games at the major gaming convention in Germany. and it was a worker placement game (my favorite mechanic). I was very excited to finally get this new game. Not disappointed at all!! The theme is so fun (elves. dwarves and gnomes). it is easy to learn. and the depth is very good. You can make it easy to play or more difficult. depending on a few simple modifications on the board. I would say it's medium to light-heavy for strategy. I got this game about two weeks ago and have already played it six times. So happy I got it. If you like games like Le Havre. Agricola. or Calyus. you will probably like this game as well. Enjoy!"
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
6,"This notebook paper isn't the best that I've used. It's still pretty nice though. It's a little on the thin side but It fits nicely in a binder. The only advantage I can think of for this thin paper is that your notebook won't be so heavy! I also wondered if the thickness of the paper meant that ink would go right though. I checked that with my runniest pen. which is a Pentel gel pen and am glad to say that the ink does not bleed through. The wide ruled paper is perfect for some children that write bigger. Other than that. the paper has no other flaws and works nicely as notebook paper."
10,"I bought this handy contraption because the Bosch brand has never let me down. It's just the tool for cutting wood trim and  does a great job on PVC pipe. too. Plus. this saw has all the features I value. I like using it freehand to square off or flush cut studs and rafter projections when prepping for drywall in my half remodeled 1930's vintage home. It can reach into places where getting a handsaw is impossible. It has a variable speed dial that lets you match the tool to the material. It's a shame it doesn't come with a blade for metal cutting. I don't use this tool as much as some of my other Bosch products. like my Progressor jigsaw. but it sure is great to have on hand. Never know just when you'll need it. Thanks. Amazon!"
11,"I bought this set for a 13 year old girl who is a friend of the family because she loves fashion. She spent the afternoon putting together a fashion line. The ribbons. sequins. beads. and 'fabrics' (paper) come in such a large variety of lovely choices I couldn't resist joining in. This would be an excellent gift for an older child in the hospital. travelling. or simply to pass a rainy weekend. There is so much paper included and choices with the stencils that this book provides a great deal of playtime."
10,"These blades cut great.  Nice clean cut on veneered products such as the side of a cabinet. etc.  Only downside. and maybe it's just with my Festool jigsaw. when ran at high speeds (cutting) these blades make the worst high pitched noise you've ever heard.  I can't even explain the sound but if you don't plug your ears it will literally make you brain dead.  You can feel your ear drums resonating in your head!  And again. maybe it's just my saw or my ears but it's painful.  If I am only making a 5&#34; cut with this blade I will literally walk off the job site to my truck and get my ear plugs.  It's that bad.  Other than that the blades cut great!"
3,"I love On the Edge! Meeting Brett. Leo and Lisa through the out of the box series made me want to know soo much more about these characters. If you haven't read the out of the box set. On the edge is a great introduction to what you will get a whole lot more of in the rest of the series. HOT scenes between the trio. and the different combinations of duos too. I just reread the story again. and the second time around it is still as good as the first... now seriously thinking about reading the rest of them again too :P I love the personalities. and they all play off of each other in great ways. Thanks Kallysten for continuing to keep me aroused. entertained. and eagerly awaiting what ever series instalment you have coming out next. :)"
5,"Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me. so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine. Seemed no matter how I tried. I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitar.It seems that &#34;C&#34; shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings. and I find that is better done by hand. So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature.  And the string winder itself also works well."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
5,"I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!"
4,"The Visual Bible Gospel of Matthew is excellent.  I love the acting and the way the Bible comes to life through the word for word script.  I found it very inspiring and helpful.  My four daughters and I have watched 'Matthew' numerous times and it always is benefitial.  I especially like the happiness that Jesus portrays.  We know he drew people to him. and the actor in this video has appropriate expressions and whatnot which make him very appealing.  Throughout the Gospel he is not always happy. of course. but is appropriate to the situations. happy. sad. angry. distressed. etc...  Jesus was very human. and this is apparent in this Visual Bible Matthew.  Jesus was also divine. and God's love shows through as well.  I really highly recommend this Visual Bible. Gospel of Matthew.Thanks!"
11,"Ihad my doubts at first.  Let's face it. when someone says &#34;Let's play monopoly.&#34; the first thing you think of is Oh no! a long boring game.  Well. that was my first impression when my husband suggested buying the game.  Totally changed my mind from the very first time we played the game.  We have family night and couples night with this game.  It is fun and worth the investment.  I know it's a little on the higher end of cost but it is lots of fun."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal. you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount. if necessary) and more tone control. but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range."
1,"I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it. not exactly a rave review but definitely a 'thumbs up'.Cheers"
4,"When I was just a little boy. my heart was filled with glee whenever my friend Underdog appeared on my TV.  From lovable. humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound. no better television show for childhood could be found.  Now that I am older. I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV.  This Collector's Set Edition. so carefully restored. can once again be purchased. to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew. ages four and six. just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks.  I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime.  So let's lift a toast to Underdog. a hero for all time. and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme."
11,"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play. it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat. but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win. until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature."
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
11,"I have never played 1st edition of Descent but always wanted to. Sadly. the time to play a game of descent was said to spread from 3-6 hours. Now. second edition comes out and it can easily be played within 1-3 hours. On top of that there are 16 quests to go on! I love how Fantasy Flight Games come out with great games and never skimp out on the quality. This is a great game for players who were always curious about Descent. it plays well and the instructions are easily learned. I would highly recommend the Conversion kit as well. This adds more monsters and heroes into your game. but does not include the miniatures. Love this game!"
10,"if you are like me and not ready to spend [money]on a dado set. look no further.  this baby performs.  i chose the 6' for my 10' delta contractors saw. i believe this is wise to compensate for the lower horsepower of my saw.  a smaller blade will have more rpm's than an 8' or 10'. its physics.  anyway. i like the case to keep it all organized and it comes with a handy guide that tells you what chippers and shims to use for certain cuts.  quite handy for undersized plywood.  big carbide tips that look like they will stand up to several sharpenings.so why did i only give it 4 stars?  someone at freud  just got off break on friday just before quitting time and shorted me an 1/8' chipper. Quality control cost ya a star Freud."
9,"After discovering the possible dangers of traditional soap and shampoo. I was recommended Dr. Bronners by a co-worker. I received it without realizing you can basically use it for anything. not just shampoo and soap. I've used Dr. Bronners for shower soap and shampoo. for washing my hands. for shaving. and for even cleaning a sink. Rumor has it you can even use it for mouth wash and/or brushing your teeth. I am not 100% sure if that's true. but it is a rumor. Try at your own risk.The smell of Dr. Bonners is great and even though it's expensive for a small amount. it &#34;lathers&#34; really well. You only need a dab of this stuff to clean a wide area of whatever you are cleaning. It doesn't leave your hair/skin dry like traditional soap and shampoo can sometimes do. It makes you smell great for a while after using it. Highly recommended to traditional soap and/or shampoo."
5,"The shell and the lining of the case are perfect: hard on the outside. and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap. and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I'm not traveling around with my guitar too much. so that's not a problem for me. but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise. it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches."
1,"Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner. and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great. however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads. I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"Well folks this saw is the best I have ever owned . I chose this one over the nonsliding variant soley for versatility . I can bounce from framing to trim with no extra work beyond flipping the crown stops .The stock 60 tooth blade is adequate for most work but for delicate ornate trim I use a series 40 ( 96 tooth blade ). I have had my saw for about 3 months and I love not doing the old ' upside down and backwards ' technique .If anyone wants to see some pics . ask and I'll email you asap.I have used it on wood .poly. and foam crown with great results.  Tom"
4,"I enjoyed the message David tries to portray and have respect for what he is trying to tell us. I am disappointed in his presentation.  Our family home schools our children and we were hoping to be able to use the series to educate our children about the christian message.  The American Heritage Series is basically just a long lecture. Its an unpolished narrated lecture that makes history boring like they do in many classrooms.  David is like the expert professor who puts his class to sleep because of presentation. I rate him 3 stars. Actually an average of 5 stars for content and 1 star for presentation."
4,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie! We have three different movie portrayals of Jesus Christ. which are completely consistent with their respective Gospels. and we enjoy all of them. (Read my other reviews if you're interested in them.)The happy. laughing Jesus in this movie is intriguing. The way he speaks to people and looks at them warmly portrays his love for everyone. I think the actor really does a great job of portraying the duality of Jesus. how much he loves us. but yet that all is not hearts and flowers and warm and fuzzy due to the human condition.If you're looking for a great movie to share with friends. family. small group. etc.. this is it! Don't watch late at night because you'll want to stay awake!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
5,"If you need it. good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated. this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument. since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap. Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price."
1,"I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise. a strange place. and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room. it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic. elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road. this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby. sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car. driven round and round and round and....)"
11,"This is the basic Fluxx card game that will change your ideas about 'rules.' There really aren't any set rules in Fluxx. That's why it's called Fluxx (though I have quickly learned this can also be used as a cuss word.) The rules are constantly changing. as are the ways in which you can win. so you can kiss any sense of strategy goodbye! You simply have to go with the flow and luck of the draw. The only thing that can ruin the fun of this fast changing game is the eventual winner. The more they gloat. the less you'll want to play."
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
9,"Today I bought the second of this scooter. The first I had bought last summer and was great. It's seen a lot of use. and a fully grown adult has put it through its paces without issue.Tonight I bought another one. and it's going back to the store immediately. The problem with it is that the handlebar tube is jammed and very stiff. There's no way a child could adjust this. since I estimate I had to apply well over 100 lbs of force with my foot against the foot area while pulling very strongly against the handle bars to get even 10&#34; of extension. I'm unable to pull it out further. The handlebar is just hopelessly jammed into the tube. so back to the store it goes.Too bad. as the rest of it continues to seem fairly bulky and lots of shiny metal everywhere."
1,"I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks. it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size. though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet. the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!"
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
4,"Blows the door open on Socialism for all to see.  We always suspected that something was not quite right behind the facade of the Soviet 'peoples paradise' and this film confirms it.  Some images are not for the faint of heart but are heart rending  in the brutality displayed. This film should be curricula in High Schools across North America.  Maybe then we could put this fascination and obsession about the glory of Communism to rest once and for all.  The survivor interviews were particularly touching.  Only a heartless b**tard or a devout Socialist / Communist could fail to be moved by the emotion on display.  A must see to fully appreciate the democracy we all enjoy."
4,"I first started reading the Mandie books when I was twelve.  Needless to say. I'm more than twice that age now.  So it was quite a delight for me when I stumbled across this movie at Blockbuster.  I had no idea they were making Mandie movies. I'm so glad to see it!  I thought this movie did a fairly accurate portrayal of Mandie and her kin.  I really enjoyed the Cherokee personalities.  And I thought Dean Jones as Jason Bond was especially good.  Uncle John was well portrayed by a dapper young gentleman.  And in essence. the movie was darling and very likeable.  The single and only reason I don't rate it a five star movie is because I thought the almost comedic style of acting in the movie detracted from what could have been a very serious and successful story line.  Other than that. I really enjoyed this movie."
8,"I had this for less than three days. The first day it was great.  I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine.  The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat.  Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated.  Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors.  Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement.  I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly.  Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter.  Within an hour the towel was saturated.  Luckily I bought it at Walmart.  Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap.  They put it aside to be reshelved.  I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it."
1,"We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version. but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better. but at this price point. I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home. and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from. but I stick to the modest. classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight. but I believe Maglite to be the best. and I hope this review helps."
4,"This four hour video looks a the familiar &quot;Joseph&quot; story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First. it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say &quot;brava&quot; to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally. the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However. my &quot;four star&quot; rating refers to the &quot;flashback&quot; section of the film.  Yes. why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the &quot;B&quot; grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden."
8,"My bullies love Nylabones. they are the one thing that they do not destroy! I got them these & the big smooth bone 2 pack for Christmas. Those were a big hit. these they don't seem to like. I do not know if it's the flavor or texture . . . They have the big smooth heavy bone looking Nylabones which they like okay. they have the BIG nubby ones which they love. so I thought they would like these but they looked at them. chewed on them a little & left them for the big smooth flavored ones in the 2 pack. Those they chew on daily along with the big nubby ones. Maybe it's the flavor. They have Nylabones that are 3 years old!"
5,"I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS:  It fits perfectly; it's 'fur' lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five). but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over. two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side. and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.CONS:  It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some 'Made in China' characteristics.I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest.  On a personal level. I'd prefer it didn't say 'Epiphone' on the outside.  But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335."
4,"What makes this little film so special is so varied and precious. that it's hard to identify one area.  Of course Rudolph is the main character. as is his little girlfriend.  Then there's Burl Ives. who narrates it. and the wonderful music of Johnny Marks.  I perform his music every year. it's so upbeat and inspirational.  That he was asked to write the music for this movie was no surprise.The animation is a little dated. but the kids won't mind.  You won't find this kind of movie made anymore.  It has so many nice qualities. not to mention Santa and his elves. and the Isle of Misfit Toys. and the 'Bumble.' and Cornelius of the Yukon.I laugh as I think of all this. and it's a sweet smile. and a great film for Christmas!!!"
9,"Being new to shooting using a scope I have found this one to be simple. rugged and easy to adjust . I have it on a Ruger American in 308 and once I used a little loc-tight  I have no worry about it moving .  My only complaint if you could even call it that was there were no scope rings included with the scope .  But with this set up shooting off a bench I have a .75 to 1 MOA rifle with the right ammo so for the price I can not complain ."
1,"This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a 'a grout brush'; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement). but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium. lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head. the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out. I will reorder another."
4,"I'm another one of those people who used to see daikaiju movies on Saturday matinee TV as a child. Close as I came to a couch potato and it made me really interested in Japan. I've been waiting so long to find these films given a proper digital conversion. The last few years have made me very excited (for an adult) as Toho has finally pulled the cork out of its uptight behind 15+ years into the digital revolution and allowed the west to see the Japanese-language widescreen versions of most of the Godzilla oeuvre without spending $$$ on an import.As usual. on Ghidorah. Classic Media has added some interesting short extras. I feel lucky. at this point. to even get to see the theatrical release. so my bias is very pro. but the price really is a no-brainer. isn't it?"
6,"I've used print at home business cards before. and they always left a rough edge.  There was no way around it- you could tell you printed them at home.  I have to say however. that these 'Clean Edge' business cards are a vast improvement on the past!  To a trained eye. you can still see the edge was that of a tear-away. but they look pretty darn good!  I wouldn't be embarrassed to pass these out. as I was with the older versions."
8,"I had my dog on this for a couple months and noticed a wonderful bloom in his coat but also noticed his ears began to be unusually smelly. I feed my dog raw so he doesn't get grains anywhere. I checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed. Took him off Nupro and his ears cleared up. We now stay away from anything with flax. After adding raw green tripe to his diet. I am noticing similar positives. It is a shame. Nupro is otherwise a great product. I would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax."
4,"First off. not ALL of this movie made sense to me. I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything. Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen 'Life Of Brian' which is the exact opposite of this film. So I might have learned some things already. I do have many questions about it. though. I get why so many people were offended. Because Jesus sinned in some way. Throughout the movie. he kept praying that he. along with a few other folks would be forgiven. but THAT'S where I get confused. Oh well. I'm surprised I did understand SOME things. and yet. it's very interesting."
10,"The Delta 12&quot; drill press is OK for a bench top model.  I was disappointed in the chuck as it tends to stick and requires using the key at all times rather than just for final tightening.  Also I believe I would rather have had the 5/8&quot; chuck that comes on the 16&quot; floor model more than the 1/2&quot; chuck supplied with the 12&quot;.  For the extra hundred and fifty (approx) bucks I should have bought the larger floor model and got better capacity. longer quill stroke. larger and more stable table for mounting fences and jigs. etc.In the 12&quot; presses defense. it was and is the nicest of the benchtop models I have seen."
3,"When I read the book description. I thought this would be an interesting read. as a story about a married couple discovering their 'forbidden' desires and kinks is right up my alley. but when I opened the ebook and realized it was a short story. I had to lower my expectations. Still. I thought it could be good. because skilled authors can make almost anything work.Sadly. that wasn't the case here. The story's premise was never developed into anything resembling a plot. The book description was the whole story. or better. the setup for the sex scene where Roake's and Jenesta's hidden sexual needs were revealed. I've read and enjoyed stories like that (aka smut) before and I'm sure I'll read and enjoy others in the future. so why didn't I like this one? It all comes down to Roake and Jenesta. I'm afraid. I didn't 'connect' with them so I found myself indifferent to their sex scene and HEA."
9,"I bought this trailer for a trip up north. My husband filled the tires at home to the correct psi. Drove it around the driveway and everything worked great. We get to our destination and go to hook it up and the tubes are BLOWN. Actually shredded looking in spots. We were way up north and spent over an hour in the car to find a town big enough that had a store that sold bike supplies. Once both tubes were replaced the trailer worked great. Very easy to put together. I couldn't figure out how to attach it to the bike but that isn't my area. My husband had it attached in less then 2 minutes. The rubber on the original tube was very thin. I'm surprised more haven't blown."
4,"This is a fairly short Christmas special but it was made in the old days when a half hour on TV contained only four minutes of commercials. The best part about The Little Drummer Boy is its wholesome simplicity. The fact that it is so unabashedly religious is its strongest point in my opinion. Chasing the hate out of your heart and replacing it with love is a valuable lesson for all children. so I agree with another reviewer about its being a timeless family classic. It begins rather slowly but the last five minutes are absolutely outstanding and worth scanning back to watch a second time. The quotations from scripture give it its oomph but this also means that it would never be televised today on any of the big three networks. This might be a good DVD to buy because you probably won't catch it for free."
5,"These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company."
6,"Not only did I use these for notebook dividers. I used them to label file folders.  They fit and look great with some minor adjustments (putting one folder inside another).  One of the nicest aspects of using these for dividers is the straight placement.  I think they look much nicer than anything I've used before.  I have several notebooks that have over 25 dividers. so the time I saved creating and applying the labels is very much appreciated. I also took advantage of the fact that I could play around with section titles to see which would fit best.Avery labels are about all I can get either at my local Staples and Wal-Mart stores.  (I don't even know who else makes them anymore.) I'll be buying these again."
11,"Formula D is a great party game that gets the entire room cheering. Even for the starter players. there is a set of basic rules that most can grasp very quickly. Every time I have played this game. I've had a great time. I do not enjoy cars or racing but the excitement of this game really gets your adrenaline going.The game lends easy to advanced players who want to implement the advanced rule set that want to make the game far more complicated and even more exciting.With the amount of people that can play. this game is a great pick for people that want to start introducing people into unconventional board games. I highly recommend this for anyone that is looking for a game to include a large group of people."
5,"Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage. it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small &#34;thumbs up&#34; to Amazon."
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
1,"This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++. would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet. so I am not sure on the quality. I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know . because I did the hard ground-level research. opening the controller. finding the battery. removing the battery. examining the battery. finding the name of the battery. replacing the battery. closing the battery containment area. and so on."
8,"My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew. and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems. with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well. that. and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep. since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!After months of use. I take the worn down toys away and replace them. and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.If you have a dog that loves chewing. I've say to give them a try. at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine. these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot."
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
11,"It threw me when my six year old asked for a body for Christmas. When he explained he wanted to know how the body works. I found this and I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. We do this often and we read the book that comes with it. The only way this could get better is if it came with a case to hold everything. He likes that the body parts are squishy and I like that he's learning while playing. The Organ-izer is one of his favorites. He likes knowing what everything is called. and I like the book that helps with proper placement of the organs. I would buy this one again!"
9,"This is a good quality indoor-outdoor basketball.  The texture is soft and very easy to grip when new. with deep seams allowing excellent ball control.  Regulation size (29.5).  Being soft. it's not Spalding's most durable outdoor ball--the Street model may be more durable if you play outdoors all the time. and the tack on this one does wear off after a couple of dozen hours on cement.  Indoors. it'll last forever and stay nice and grippy. It needed a little air when I received it. but otherwise. I'm totally satisfied with it.  (Although not a big deal. I also happen to like the rich leather-like color more than the brighter orange of some balls.)"
6,"These are amazing! How clever that someone devised a way to bend thin strips of shiny metal in such a fashion that they can be used to clip several sheets of paper products together so they don't get lost. They don't work as well as my stapler. but those with commitment issues will find the paper clip a great alternative. They can also be bent into fun shapes when you are faced with idle time sitting at your desk. However. it seems that once they are altered from their original shape. they do not perform their intended task very well anymore. Sure glad that I purchased 1.000 of these little buggers."
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"I bought one to try it; I will be buying more. All I had to do was adjust the screws for a tight fit.  Some have criticized the noise level; remember that blades designed for exceptionally smooth cuts will contribute to the noise level because of their inherent design characteristics.  If this is a problem for you. cut the initial slot using a blade with a strong alternating angle on the teeth and a wide kerf.When installing. you might have to increase the relief on the bottom; my blade was all the way down and made contact after only 1/4 turn but I didn't have to increase the relief.Personally. I'm going to buy at least 2 more; one for 45 degree angles and one for my dado blade.  Exceptional quality and price."
1,"got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But. the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4.5.8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts."
4,"Richard Boone is both narrator and participant in some of these episodes.  The historical background given by Boone in the opening scenes is brief and to the point so that you can be taken to the scene of the action quickly and efficiently.This series is a fine snapshot of medical practices of the 1950s which might seem outmoded now.  Electro-convulsive therapy is shown as a treatment practice in the '50s.  The effects of a nuclear bomb explosion are graphic and chilling to watch and listen to.  The open heart valve replacement is quite intriguing even in black and white.  Overall this is a series that while it might seem to be somewhat dated is good for historical background and comparison with the way medicine is practiced now.Growing up in the 1950s this was the state of medicine as I knew it and it seemed pretty impressive.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in medical history."
4,"Did I miss something that the other reviewers saw? Or did I get a defective DVD set? This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The &quot;Cliffhanger episodes&quot; are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father. Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls."
9,"Coleman stoves have always been easy to dent. scratch. get burned on and are not for the weak of spirit.  On the other hand. properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost.  The white gas can be stored for years before using.  Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots.  I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones.  It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out!  I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous. tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect.  By their nature camp stoves get stored a lot and used some.  These are the good ones."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
11,"ABBY CADABBYThe Easter Bunny brought Abby to our two year old granddaughter this year.  Abby is one of Paige's favorites on Sesame Street.  When Paige saw little Abby sitting in her Easter basket she screamed ABBY! and hasn't let go of her since.Abby is made very well. very sturdy and durable. She is a GUND. so you know she is of high quality.  Her outfit is bright and shiny. her little mouth has a heart in the center of it.  She is cuter than you can imagine and a doll that any little girl would love to own.  She comes complete with her wand; how could she function without it?Abby has a good and happy home now.  Get one for your special little girl.  We did!Thank you!Pam"
3,"Angie was expecting to spend a lonely Christmas all by herself until she shares some unexpected time with sexy boss Ryan Tyler at the Christmas party.  When he asks her to come home with him. she jumps at the chance.  It isn't until he is ready to leave the party that Ryan remembers he really is having company - his pal Wade.  They have shared many women in the past. maybe they will share Angie too.When Angie and Ryan arrive at his house. they can't keep their hands off each other.  A knock at the door interrupts them. and Wade is suddenly on the scene.  For the first time in his life. Ryan has to face unfamiliar feelings. and the fact that he doesn't want to share Angie.This is a very erotic sexy story.  The chemistry between Angie and Ryan is to die for."
8,"I haven't used the product long enough to evaluate whether or not it will help my dog's hip dysplasia. however I can tell you that it has caused HORRIFIC gas. Bad enough that I had to put my dog out of my room in the night (wher he usually sleeps) because it was almost gagging me and was hard to breathe. He has not had a diet change. the only thing changed is I added this supplement to his regular food. so it's obviously the supplement causing the gas. Not sure how long I can handle the gas. but I will give it some more time to see if it helps his hips. as he really needs that."
1,"I suffer with very very dry eyes. They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them. Recently the drops just weren't doing it for me anymore.... felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan. I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes. I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging. For my 'Dry eye syndrome' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped. My eyes are no longer red. They do not burn. they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it."
9,"I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years.  I have lots of knives. as I'm a collector but this is my go-to blade for just about anything from fishing to cutting up boxes.  For the price. it's hard to get a better knife.  I still use my old one after 15 years. even though my wife bought me this new one last Christmas.  There's no reason to ever second guess whether or not you should buy this knife.  It's a no brainer.  The newer one changed ever so slightly. but for all practical purposes it's the same one I've been using all these years.  Just get it.......trust me!"
4,"Ghidorah (also known as 'Ghidrah' in the U.S. edit of the film) is a merciless three-headed dragon from outer space with the abilities to shoot lethal electric bolts from its mouths. and it will have to take the combined might of Rodan. Mothra. and Godzilla to defeat it! A very enjoyable movie. It starts out a bit slow. but once the film starts to get going. it has possibly some of the best and most exciting action scenes out of any Godzilla movie. With a really good story. four monsters. one of them Ghidorah - my favorite Godzilla villain. it's hard not to like this one. This film also features Godzilla's transition from bad guy to good guy and the last one in a long while to be taken mostly seriously. A great movie that would be a shame to miss out on.Highly Recommended!"
4,"I have many copies of this movie. I pass it on a lot..I use it in teaching religion classes all the time..Jesus is not a solomman who walks around in majesty...He is a person who loves the people he heals.he laughs.he is charismatic.he cries...he isGod....He is the Jesus I always in visioned.....If you aren't afraid to take Jesus off his holier then thou shelf and placehim in the human world of laughter.love.and pain...and still be the Son of God. I suggest this movie."
9,"The soap smells nice. lathers up easily and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. I am a firefighter and after being exposed to smoke from burning plastics etc the smell stays with you for a day or two. I use this soap and it seems to get rid of that nasty smokey feeling after the first shower. I have it in my locker at work and in my shower at home. I will probably never buy any other soap at this point. I like the tip from others about using a foaming dispenser...will try that for sure.I dinged it one star due to the preachy label. I peeled the label off as soon as I got it since it only has a few lines about the actual product and ingredients. all the rest is like scripture. If religion is your thing. good for you. but I don't need it in my face and I don't need a religious message on the stuff that I am paying for."
4,"'...'The Passion of the Christ' has caused plenty of controversy. just like the ministry of Christ did and still continues to do to this day. When a faith-oriented film has such an emotional impact on so many lives and creates so much discussion between millions of people with different religious backgrounds. you know a must-see feature has been made.' -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder'It's the same story the Bible's been telling us for years. but Mel Gibson did a truly awesome job of bringing it to people in such a real way.' -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films. check out cruciflicks.net where 'We don't judge people. just the movies they make.'"
4,"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney. this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift. but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl. and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age. you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.That is what indicates real staying power. not how many toys one can invent. market and make profit from."
6,"These come in one of those standard cheap plastic containers which is always a bummer because you end up needing to put them in something else eventually.  However. the price was great for a 30 count of various sizes.  The only size lacking is the very large ones which I do have occasion to use when I'm unable to use anything but.  That or sit with a whole puncher forever and put them into a binder.  The shipping was quick and they were in pristine condition when they arrived.  I haven't as of yet had a problem with them not being durable which is big bonus so great material."
10,"I bought this belt sander to help strip the barn board floors in our 1870 farm house.  The unit worked very well to strip 85% the lacquer that would other wise instantly plug up may dewalt pad sander.  I have used roughly 20 of the 40 grit belts so far and only had to adjust the tracking only three times during heavy use.  As far as the bag unit provided I have not tried it as my wife had bought a small shop vac years ago that had the right size hose to attach to the exhaust port for instant dust removal. I did have the dust collection unit plug up once but I did use a large shop vac to blow air backwards through the sander and it cleaned out the plug instantly.  Overall I'm very pleased I bought this sander."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
5,"This is a tough unit. easy to set and locks tight.  The materials are robust.In a home studio there is never a lot of room and I didn't want a big boom hanging off the other side of my mic stand.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the package there is an illustration of this being used at the end of a long boom to hang a mic in the perfect possition. and yeah. one could totally do that with this.This is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture."
10,"Have hung my share of drywall over the years (not as a pro) and always used either hammer and drywall nails or a cordless drill with a bit to drive screws.  This drywall screwdriver really speeds up the process--even for a small room.  It does take a while to get the hang of it. however. because unless you drive the in screw perfectly straight. it won't seat properly and you'll have to back it out and try again.  I'd practice driving a few screws on a scrap of drywall first to get the knack of using it and to adjust the depth setting for your job before beginning work--the screw should be just below the surface of the paper so you don't hit it with a taping knife--if the knife &#34;clicks&#34; on the screw when you go over it. you need to set the depth a little lower."
8,"At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically.  It definitely doesn't get chewed down.  The material is very. very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth..  However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls.  Me I don't like it. but the dog does and since she doesn't chew on it obsessively. unlike other things I'm not too worried about her teeth."
5,"i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break strings.hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands."
9,"The lock combination can be set by the user.  I bought 6 of them. and set the combination the same on all of them to make it easy for me to remember (I only have to remember one combination. and I do not have to worry about loosing any keys).  This is an excellent feature.I also like that it fits on my shotguns. pistols. and rifles.  You can not see it in the picture. but when you separate the two sides of the lock. there are pressure pins that catch the trigger mechanism to ensure a tight and secure closure on the trigger.  Very good design at a great price."
3,"On the Edge will keep you on the edge of your seat as you read this hot story by Kallysten. On the Edge is a short story about a couple. where Brett is the owner of the On the Edge Club and has an apartment above the club with his silent partner Lisa.  Although the club is new in town. it is an instant success as humans and vampires gather to party together.Lisa. a vampire goes down to the club to party and feed. Leo. a vampire from her past appears and she brings him home to play with Brett and her.  Brett is surprised that he likes what the three of them do together. The next morning Leo isn't sure how Brett will feel but the surprise ending made this a perfect short story.  On the  Edge may be short but it is packed with emotion and lots of hot vampire sex.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review.  The views expressed in the review are my own."
1,"I have been using Ayr Nasal Gel for the past two years at bed time and have found that it keeps my nasal passages open throughout the night and it has eliminated the stuffiness I had before discovering this product.  I buy it in quantity from Amazon and save substantially from retail pharmacy's.  I can't recommend it more highly. especially after this winter.  Since it has been unseasonably cold making keeping adequate humidity in the home next to impossible with humidifiers and even warm mist vaporizors. Ayr Nasal Gel has provided relief that otherwise would of made my sleeping through the night extremely difficult. A small amount at the bottom of each nostril is all one needs to use and a tube will last for a reasonable time making it a cost effective means verses nasal strips."
11,"If you're new to Munchkin. I recommend checking out the original Munchkin and its reviews first for game play. mechanics. and feedback.  Especially my review.  It's a good one.  (Shameless self-promoting - I have no pride.)Munchkin 2 is an expansion of the original Munchkin.  It's not a complete game in itself.  It provides no new variants to game play. no extra aspects to consider. no new rules.  It's just more cards.  More items. more monsters. more humor. more cool stuff.BUT... more cards means less card repetition which makes the game more fun and definitely increases the replay value.  And the new bits of humor on the cards is worth the extra cost alone.  Size (of your deck) matters.Munchkin is awesome.  Buy this.  Buy it now."
4,"I first rented this when I was about 15 &amp; my mum went apes**t. A movie about a guy who kills people with a blowtorch. COOOOOL! However the blowtorch isn't that big a player in the movie. This is your typical Vietnam vet revenge story ad nauseum. Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds &quot;life&quot; to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes. including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed. and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder? I'd advise you not to eat a hamburger while watching this movie. Worst of all though is the godawful country-western song which plays during the opening credits. Yeech!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
9,"This was a great surprise for the money.  I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out. At this price why not?  I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.  The door anchor worked great.  I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.  This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I highly recommend."
1,"This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good. subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy. those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS."
3,"This is a short story that give you an insight to the series of On The Edge .. Brett owner to a club that not only caters to Vampire but humans as well.. and his girlfriend of 11 months... And how Leo well you gotta read...There is a M/M. M/F. M/F/M scenes not graphic...I found the book to be interesting and different... Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series...I received to book for an honest review and with being a spoiler I found the book to be 4 stars. thanks"
3,"A little ho hum.  Joanna is a great heroine who really needs a break.  Aiden is her break.  He is a super nice guy but the I can never love again because I buried my heart with my first wife has been done to death.  He comes from a dream family with the exception of one brother who i assume will crop up in another book.  They're all kindness and light.  The good people from the church however are all mean and backstabbing.  Could someone explain to me why in all these Christian books the church goers are gossipy hags who have fun hurting peoples feelings.  Anyway it is nicely written and has some real charm going for it.  But don't expect originality."
8,"I have a senior maltese who is prone to knee problems.  He began experiencing pain in his legs when jumping on and off the couch so I decided to get these for him to help with his joints.  I give him one each day and I have not seen him limp or yelp in pain ever since I started giving these to him. which has been over a year.  The best part is. he loves the taste of them. and when I open up the baggie. he gets super excited and starts wagging his tail and licking his lips!  I knocked off one star b/c I have noticed that some bags are not as fresh as others (no I haven't tasted the product myself but the fresher products are softer and the older ones are harder)."
8,"This product is great for about 1-2 years. Over time. the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food. which causes the motor to break down. even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor. so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain. but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food. fur. and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir."
10,"If you've got a lot of wood that's the same width to rip. this featherboard is a great help!  It locks onto an iron table like a suction cup. and is hard to move without using the built-in cam.  The built-in cam makes it easy to move when you're ready to reposition it.Here are the only things I don't like about the product:1)  If you're not doing a lot of repetitive cuts. it's sometimes more trouble than it's worth to set it up.2)  If there's ANY dust on your table. the effectiveness is immediately reduced.3)  The plastic holddown makes a loud SLAP sound when you push the wood past it.  You get used to it. but it does cause one's attention to be diverted sometimes. and that's not great.Having said all those negative things. however. I'd rate the tool 4 stars out of 5. and I use mine on my table saw at least 2 times a week."
3,"Kasey and Garrett are twins who happen to be both gay and public figures. Garrett is an out gay actor and Kasey a basketball player who isn't ashamed of his sexuality but is hesitant about comming of for safety reasons.Gram is an openly gay club owner in the city the twins live in. Garrett frequents the club more often than Kasey does but Gram has a crush on Kasey.This is Kasey and Gram's story and it is a good one about find love and working to hold on to it even when it doesn't fit your 'ten year plan' to have it now.Kasey and Gram find ways to be together without to many problems and Gram is an amazing partner who respects Kasey's need to not be out to the world.A very good short story that delivers on many levels with some pretty hot sex scens"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
10,"I have used this sander in many ways it was not intended. Abuse after abuse it keeps running. I would have given it four stars because the dust bag is somewhat cheap and does not attach properly but then I dropped it 2 stories on to a paved driveway. Not even a dent. Up to five stars. I have used it non stop for hours. I should have bought more sander for the tasks but it was there and I needed a sander. When I do finally get a random orbital sander I will get another DeWalt."
4,"I really wanted to buy a kickboxing video that would not be too complicated. As a user of other Kathy Smith videos. I decided to purchased this one. The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout. Unlike a lot of Kathy's other videos. there are no modifications for lower or higher intensity. but since it is not a standard floor aerobics video. it really isn't necessary to do so. If you are looking for something different to add to your routine. this is a good choice."
6,"I've used Avery labels since my days as a mail clerk. way back in the Carter administration.  They have always offered a top-quality product. and the Easy Peel line for laser printers are no exception.These labels are just so wonderful; by using word processing software such as Microsoft Word. one can easily select the 'labels and envelops' option under 'Tools' and up pops the correct format for the labels.  Just start typing or import addresses and you are ready to go.  I'll admit that the most use I've had on these labels are for Christmas cards and hand writing labels. but these would be great for a small business.Recommended product; another winner from Avery.  They work well. perform well. and don't screw up the laser printer.  As good as it gets."
6,"These 1' x 2 5/8' labels have many uses. I've been using them for quite a while. and they've always performed perfectly. They stick well and they don't smudge.Also. although Avery says that each sheet should only go through a printer once. who works like that? I've done sheets printing one label at a time. with no problems at all. If you do that. I'd recommend starting with the bottom row of labels and working your way up. Of course. your laser printers might be different from mine. so your mileage might vary.The labels now have a 'Pop-up Edge' for easy peeling. but I haven't used it. since I usually print one label at a time. The pop-up edge facilitates peeling of an entire column of labels at once. However. I've never had the slightest bit of trouble peeling labels off individually.They are excellent labels. and Avery offers software and/or templates to make it easy to print on them."
8,"I received the bears (bought 2 of them) yesterday and I gave my 9 month old puppy Macie(Pug & JRT Mix) one of the bears. She had the pocket pulled out thru the head where the squeeky is within 30 min or so. She continued to play with the bear but also the pocket and the squeeky is just about destroyed....lol...she has a tendency to destroy every squeeky in a toy. so this doesnt surprise me. A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet. I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped 'Macie approved'"
8,"I just received this product and I ordered it for my dog&#8217;s food. I bought a 30 pound bag that I&#8217;ve been using and then filled in this container but it over flowed! (My dog eats Natures Recipe for adults) So right of the back a little FYI. Also the door for closing has a little snapped and it has a place on top to put a lock. Since mine was full the door is snapping back open.I ordered this product because it looked convenient to take the food out and I liked the container size. The size is the only reason why I&#8217;m thinking about keeping it but I&#8217;m not 100% sure right now."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
5,"Super low capacitance- on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from Mogami. Canare. etc. The connectors are fantastic and they come with Planet Waves' super-handy elastic cord wrap. These are outstanding guitar cables at a VERY good price. I used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors. but with these. I don't see the point. The lifetime exchange warranty also makes the DIY repair thing kind of pointless too (of course Amazon's return policy is still 30 days. so be aware of that- you'd need to mail it back to the MFR or take it to another dealer to exchange - that is if you ever had to)."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
1,"I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard. and sometimes I shave in the shower. so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time. but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also. if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week). I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product."
11,"I tried playing and my eyes glazed over and I was so so lost; meanwhile 6 kids sit down figured it out and can't quit playing.'Oh. take a halfling from Matt'' I have borrowed swords.''Does anyone have a plutonium dragon?''Do you have a wandering monster?''I have an illusion card.''I have a nasty drooler.''Can you kill it?''You'll trade me 2 treasures for that?''Is anyone a warrior?''I'm a warrior; I would give you... no. I'm not going to trade my warrior.''Let's take a level away from Matt.''I could make you an elf. Madi.''I'll just try to run away. I mean what's the worst that can happen. I'm dead. So. I can just escape from it.''So. you lose your helmet.''Hey can I be a girl instead of a boy?''Are you a cleric?'If you are looking for a great gift for a 13- 16 year old (which is probably the hardest age bracket in the world to buy for) you should consider this."
8,"I have a 7 year old Maltese. and a nine month old miniature schnauzer. The size of these treats was fine for them. and after some initial reluctance at the unusual flavors (pizza and cheese. with chicken and beef being the normal flavors) the dogs seemed to like them. However. the day after I began feeding them Scooby Snacks the Maltese began throwing up. and the Schnauzer had alarming. unnaturally colored diarrhea. It did not immediately occur to me that it might be the treats. but the next day when the symptoms continued I stopped feeding them treats altogether and all upset ceased. Nobody else seems to have had this problem. perhaps I simply got a bad batch. but I am not willing to try these again."
10,"I'm crazy about these blades. blades that perform exactly as promised. I made some cuts with my Bosch jigsaw using regular blades. Then I switched blades and made cuts in the same materials with the Progessor blades. I was awed. The cuts were easy. fast. and smooth. I even made some cuts in the wooden garden ties picked up from Home Depot. I usually cut these with my chain saw. The ties were no obstacle for my Bosch jigsaw armed with Progressor blades.I've used these blades on plywood. planks. garden ties. and 2' PVC pipe with equal success."
5,"These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine. I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use. I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers. or put undue stress on your guitar. Not only that. but they sound great. Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass. I love how they color code their strings on the 'ball ends'. To me this makes it much easier when changing strings. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands. Give these a try. I think you'll be satisfied."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
5,"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano. which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion. a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."
3,"This was a mildly interesting. slightly humorous. day-to-day chronicle of a very boring guy's life. I found the historical insights engaging. and some of the daily activities of people in those days interesting. I wish that there had been a little more about the wider events that were happening beyond just the writer's activities. But. then. that would not have been in concert with the title of the book. The author certainly believed in truth in advertising. The title of the book says it all. It's a quick read and never complex."
10,"This is a life saver. and delivers as promissed. but is way over priced for what it is.I cut a lot of yellow pine. which wants to pinch behind the blade.  I've had to shut the saw off too many times in the middle of a cut and pray for no kickback.  That is why I knew it was time to invest in one of these before something went wrong.  After ~30min setup on a Grizley 1023SL. I can't believe that I didn't buy one sooner.  It is so easy to add and remove the splitter. that you keep it on the saw!!!  The only drawback is the price.  Considering it cost half of what the saw cost me. it was hard to pony up that much cash.  But I must say. that it is still cheaper than one trip to the ER."
11,"This is the updated Fantasy Flights version of HTMF. This game portrays you as a hungry penguin on the hunt for tasty fish. In doing so you must round up your fish before any rival penguins claim it for their own. Your game board per se consist of 40 hexagonal tiles and always changes. Some might complain that this takes awhile to set up. but if you have some help with your other player(s) set up is a breeze. Fantastic game. great price and best of all the WIFE loves it!"
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
6,"It has an eye-angled. upright display. and is perfect to work on a desk. The keypad is not as soft as other calculators on the market. giving you a retro and reliable feel (if you have ever used those full size desktop calculators popular a decade ago. you know what I am talking about.)I find other calculators (e.g.. Sharp EL-377T) awkward to use on a desk. They are perfect for handheld. If you want to have a calculator on your desk and operate with one hand and without leaning forward to check the LCD screen. this Canon LS-82Z is perfect for you."
5,"This is my second order of the 10 pack. A local store wants 29.99 for one set of these. The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands I've tried; including. and especially the most commonly used eb's. I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings. On occasion. it looks as if the winding is chipping off. but not at the frets. I change strings quite often so it really doesn't matter. Not sure what that's about but it doesn't affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars. Any less and I'd look dumb."
5,"I bought this pedal at a local shop and use it with both guitar and Bass. I usually put it before a distortion pedal and my original Phase 90. or use it as a standalone with an old amplifier to even out the signal. I do notice it is more effective with the guitar than bass. but that is typical. I usually do not turn the compression knob past 12 o'clock. but when using a chain of pedals. the compressor helps even out the lows and highs. The pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also. For the price. it seems like the best economical choice for compressor pedal out there and the MXR pedals are built like tanks. I have had this one and the Bass model for years and they hold up great while showing their age well."
10,"I've had my Delta planer for quite awhile now. In its lifetime it has had hundreds of board feet of hard and soft wood passed thru its portels. Much of this wood has been some of the hardest stuff on the planet. Mesquite. Quebracho. Vera. Mistol and white Oak just to name a few. I am on the first edge of my second set of knives. As in all planers. knife adjustment is critical. and with these knives it is as simple as tying your shoelace. Knives are sharp enough to shave with out of the pkg. and the locater holes make alignment a snap. Getting four cutting edges for this price makes the whole package a five star unit. I've had my problems with some Delta products. but this isn't one of them.Love the planer and love these knives. Highly recommend."
5,"This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar. the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul."
8,"I have used Frontline Plus on all my dogs for years. It works great on my toy poodle and bichon; who are indoor 22/7.Now for my other dog a pitbull mix.. he gets ticks 3 weeks after I put in the application. I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin. but these ticks don't die! they feed on his blood :.( it gets bad. He stays outside 16 hours a day. I dont know why front line doesn't work with him. It works great with my other dogs."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
5,"On my mixer. I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip. return on the ring. and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4' TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return."
6,"Before the age of checkbook register smartphone apps. I dutifully turned to this calculator to balance my checkbook. I'd tried other calculators. but they were either too small. the keys were too close together. the display too small. or something else made them less than ideal. With this one. it stays in place on my desk. it has a large display. the buttons are laid out intuitively. it goes well with my modern decor. and it has both battery and solar power. This calculator would be good for home of business use. but would not be suitable for a student since it does not come with a case and probably would not stand up to being thrown around in a backpack. locker. or desk."
1,"this wax is awesome. its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out. and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube. ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75% gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens. Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them."
11,"This is a very fun and educational game.  Players use cute trains to build 'tracks' across the US to different cities completing a card that details what cities need to be linked to get points.  Its very easy to learn.  The only thing is that it can be complicated to score the game-we tend to do it at the end of the game rather than trying to do it during play.  This is one of the few games that is fun with just two players.  Very Entertaining! (ticket to ride Europe is also fun)."
6,"The first time I purchased Scotch Gift Wrap Tape was three years ago at Christmastime.  I saw it in the drugstore. thought it looked interesting. and decided to treat myself to something new/different.  I immediately became a big fan of it: it blended perfectly with my wrapping paper. virtually disappearing.  I was impressed with how nice it looked.  And. like regular Scotch tape. it was very strong and very easy to work with.Nowadays. this is the only Scotch tape I buy.  It's perfect for everything: home. office. crafts. and of course gift wrapping.  The price is the same as the other types of Scotch type.  It works just as well. if not better.  And it's made in the U.S.A.  What more could you ask for?This is one of those simple. elegant. no-frills products that gets the job done. and done right. every time.  Give it a try. you'll love it."
4,"Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic. rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas. I meant Happy Holidays!"
4,"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur 'The Fonz' Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts. he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it. as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."
9,"This is the little brother of the DMT diafold.  Very light and small.  I keep one on my keychain.  The extended length when open. is an aid to keeping a constant angle.  I have never had one come apart but I suspect they are not as durable as the diafold and are not available two sided (two different grits) which of course. would be heavier.  Mine seem to be rust resistant for use with water to wash away metal dust which would otherwise accumulate on the surface.  These Mini Sharps are not for any work heavier than edge maintenance.UPDATE 9/7/2012:-- The molded-on flanges of the plastic handle broke off when I tried to unfold my Mini-Sharp. No more than normal force was applied.  It is now in two pieces.  I want an item like this to be dependable. Lowering my rating to one star."
4,"This is the best film I'm ever seen. It is more than a movie. seeing 'The Passion of the Christ' is literally a spiritual experience that will not leave you the same. You will be changed one way or the other after seeing what Jesus suffered. The realism of this portrayal captures the historical context of the days Jesus was on earth. Use of the original language adds to the authenticity. Similarly the ethnicity of the actors adds another layer to foundation of capturing history on film.This is an instant classic indeed. Any objective viewer who sees it cannot deny this fact. It is 'other.' i.e.. it is in a category of its own. Yes it might be listed as a 'religious film.' but it is so much more. The artists. producer. writers. creators who put this work together had the help of a Power beyond their abilities."
9,"I got this for my father-in-law for Christmas. The knife is a smidge bigger than what I would have liked. however. it does have all the basic tools I would want in a Swiss Army Knife. After reviewing multiple knives I don't think there is another that has this convenient a set of tools. There are others with more bells and whistles. but I wouldn't want to have anything bigger for daily carry. If you are willing to sacrifice some tools there are smaller knives. but then you find yourself missing things when you need them. This knife is a good balance in the middle. Quality is what you would expect from a Swiss Army Knife."
4,"this is from the series of books that spawned the wizard of oz film.in this one.the lion must find the ultimate icon of good or something to that effect.i belive its a flower.dorothy is along for the ride too.the witch has a evil icon that spreads evil to everything it touches.only the flower can stop the witch.the kids like it some.its a fantasy/adventure type deal.the wizard of oz movie was far better than this cartoon.ive never read the book but i think it would be quite excellent.id love to see the other books turned into films also."
5,"I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it. but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick. sweep pick. tremelo pick. tap with the pick better. Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me. Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^.^"
3,"I finally read this book last month and enjoyed every chapter. It shows how they managed to survive on the island by making tools and items in their cave. This book is by far one of the best 'stranded on an island' books you could hope for. It is probably one of Jules Verne's best. The inhabitants of an island are banded together and when they get into a tight spot. there is a mysterious force that always helps out. This force is not revealed until nearly the end. I highly recommend it to everyone."
3,"I really can't say I loved it. It was good in parts and than slow and boring in others.  My biggest problem with the book I think has to do with the heroine. Yes. he abandoned her and so on but after he explains his reasons which were understandable you would think that the wife at some point would understand too. but nope.It takes 245 pages for this 2 to actually get together. After they finally get to lie together something else comes up and we have to read another 100 more pages for this women to forgive him again. The story and the idea is not bad the last 40 pages were quit good and romantic but before I reached those I actually struggled to continue reading."
11,"This game is very easy to learn (I don't understand any of the negative reviews saying it's &#34;too complex&#34;) and lots of fun. as long as you're not the big loser in any particular game. Imagine getting hemmed in and locked down in Settlers of Catan. multiplied by 100. That's how frustrating this game is if you happen to choose the wrong path cards which (unbeknownst to you at the time) conflict with someone else's ambitions. Satisfaction with the game is very hit and miss. as it can be VERY tedious when you have no chance of accomplishing your objections. Part of the appeal of the game is also one of its biggest drawbacks: you can easily see how well you're doing compared to everyone else. which means that you can also tell very easily when you have no chance at all of winning."
1,"I have been using another. more viscous. product for quite some time for dry eye. I tried this and liked it as something to use in between. because it is thin enough. it does not blur my vision. However. it is too thin for much protection now that the heat is on in the house. so I use both. alternating them. I have a bone to pick with the makers. though. They designed the little containers (this is preservative free single containers) with a funny grip that often blocks the liquid from coming out. which is very frustrating and not good for use while driving."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
8,"Previously I had fed our Lhasa other brands of food rolls in different flavors but after trying Redbarn Food Rolls. our four-legged companion voted her favorite flavor as Redbarn Beef.  I alternate morning and evening food between the food roll and kibbles. The 4-pound food rolls are so easy to store in the fridge and for long-term in the freezer.  I slice a whole roll into 1-inch slices and then halve them before dividing into two containers - one container for every day and one container in the freezer for future use.  I stick with the Zukes Mini Treats (all flavors) for bribes and training treats.  The food roll is boxed with bubble packing and arrived within a day or two after I placed my order."
3,"The first concern with the paranormal romance genre is whether it is believable enough.  Could I suspend my disbelief?  Yep.  Worked for me.  I liked haveing the bundle because I plowed through these pretty fast.  Each book centers around a man who for genetic and psychological reasons is outcast but loyal.  So... this could take place in Medieval times. a police force. or on a ranch.  The conflicts and the subtle character traits are the best part.  I also like that the danger and mystery element held up.  Sometimes its just a way to get the characters in bed.  Oh. there's that too. but the human element and the well-painted scenery makes these wolves &#34;real.&#34;"
11,"A D&D; themed euro game. What more could you want? :)Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement euro game through and through. You will be placing your 'agents' out in waterdeep to recruit clerics. fighters. wizards and rogues to help you complete quests. Each Lord of Waterdeep has a specific objective for you to complete. like focusing on certain types of quests. You get points by completing quests and bonus points if those quests are of the type requested by your Lord.This game has similar mechanics to Stone Age. Caylus and other worker placement games. but if you like Euro games and D&D;. this is a great one to pick up. It plays in as little as an hour and even though the box says 12+ my 9 yr old plays it with ease."
5,"I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals.I don't use this on my pedal board and don't know if I would recommend it for heavy live use. I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here.It does work well and will power many pedals at one time. I do not use it for powering only one pedal though. This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals.I also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet.Easy to use - it is what it is."
3,"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book. I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that. however. was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book. things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys. other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States. and. the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who. in this instance. are prepared to be generous."
9,"These bands are some of the most well constructed I have seen.  They also have clips on the ends which allows them to be used in tandem. so the red. black. green. blue. and yellow can all be used together for extra resistance. which is a major plus for athletes who need more resistance.  The door anchor included is a very simple design. but it works well.  All of the bands also have a lifetime warranty. just call them and they will ship you a new one (you have to pay shipping though).  The handles are well constructed. and the wrap around handle is pretty standard universal gym type stuff.  Will buy from this company again."
9,"I really like these bands for travel workouts. They take virtually no space in your bag and provide enough resistance for a respectable workout. It's hard to quantify how much weight each one represents. For a thorough workout for each muscle group. it pays to get the extra heavy. heavy and medium bands. Honestly. it's good for some muscle groups. like the triceps. biceps. shoulders and even the back. I haven't used the door attachment. but for the chest. good old-fashioned pushups will do the trick on the road. won't they? As you adjust your foot position on the rubber. you increase or decrease the resistance. Certainly worth the money. as many hotels have sub-standard guyms and 15 minutes with these bands can work you out just fine."
11,"Bananagrams the game is ok. not great.  I guess some people like it. but it's not my cup of tea.  What this is to me is a great set of tiles in a portable bag.  I use the tiles to play another game. Snatch-It.  Snatch-It is a much better game than Bananagrams. but it comes with terrible tiles.  They're harder to read. and there's not nearly enough vowels.  Buy Bananagrams. buy Snatch-It. use the Bananagrams tiles with the rules from Snatch-It."
5,"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz. eq. or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say."
6,"This is a basic stand for a monitor.  It's just a curved metal tube with a metal plate affixed to the top.  The first one I got was defectively assembled -- the metal plate on top was crooked. badly out of square.  I returned it. and the replacement is much better.The color is a sort of metallic black.  There is a gray Allsop logo painted on in raised letters on the front right part of the tube.It gets the job done and looks decent enough."
5,"Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas. but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks. depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood. really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest. but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward."
9,"I'll start by saying this knife may be small. but it is sturdy. It is perfect to carry on you keyring as it's small size won't make your keys excessively bulky and yet it has everything you'd need for day to day uses. It has a knife that is great for cutting small items (string and packaging etc) and although i've had mine for years it is still as sharp as the day I bought it. The scissors may be a touch fiddly but they are sharp and function well. The file and screwdriver have also come in handy at various times. These knives are always well made and their reputation is well deserved. they manage to be aesthetically pleasing. easy to use and sturdy all at the same time. no mean feat. A good entry level swiss army knife and perfect for small jobs whilst out and about.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,"If you like Christmas movies besides 'The Nightmare before Christmas'. you should add this one to your collection. If you don't like Christmas movies then buy 'The Grinch' or 'The Christmas Carol' and see what you act like Grinch/Scrooge. In my humble opinion this is the best telling of Rudolph's story in a musical. Many added side stories with Hermey the dentist. Yukon Cornelius. Abominible Snowman. and the Island of Misfit Toys adds to make a great story. The animated figures are excellent and smooth motioned. Excellent narration by Burl Ives. The music is first rate and will have the family singing along."
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
9,"I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me.  Right out of the packaging. this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable. but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also. the product description says that it is designed for 'spin bikes' and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes. so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike.  However. it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it. even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible.  This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs. which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times. but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand."
8,"We have an 85-pound dog and use 1.000 bags per year (3 per day). There is no denying how good these are. as described by other reviewers. It's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task.What bothers me though is the extra plastic and expense involved with these. Taking into account environmental and economic factors. I prefer to use the smaller and thinner120 Earth Rated Dog Waste Bags. Lavender Scented. 8 Rolls. 120-Count.So what we do is keep both items on hand in a fanny pack. For the biggest or messiest 'jobs'. we use Mutt Mitts. For typical 'duty'. the above linked product is very good. That way everyone wins!"
11,"I LOVE the illustrations on these flashcards. That is what prompted me to buy them for my daughter's second birthday. The cards are very sturdy and have a nice weight and finish to them. My one issue is trying to keep them together. The ring that holds the card together is kind of flimsy. There is value in having the cards be detachable but I almost wish the ring was more permanent. It can be frustrating when you are missing cards. Overall. these are the most attractive. charming ABC flashcards I have ever found. I think I may have been a little too eager though because my daughter is only 2 and she doesn't seem that interested yet. But if you want some nice sturdy flashcards with charming. frameworthy illustrations I would buy these."
10,"I bought this tapering jig prior to tapering my first table leg. It was inexpensive. I was inexperienced. 'nuff said.  The surprise came with its performance.  Although I am confident that I could bend this thing in half  if I was in the right mind. it does a really good job of guiding my  workpiece through the saw.  The adjustment feature is simple and easy to  use. but the &quot;graduated scale&quot; is a bit hard to use accurately.  To set it up. I simply adjust it by eye and then measure from the blade to  the trailing edge of the guide.  This trial and error usually takes no more  than a minute or two. and the jig stays locked on my final setting for as  many cuts as I need to make.  Although there are nicer. more expensive  versions out there. you cannot beat the value for the money with this tool."
10,"All the reviews of this and similar Fein blades are true; they cost a lot and they are fragile and easy to break. I am now faced with the prospect of replacing some of my broken and dull blades and I am willing to pay the price because I must. I have invested over a thousand dollars in blades and sandpaper for the Multimaster and the capabilities that having this kit gives me are too numerous to mention. My advice is to use this particular blade as a last resort. those few instances when no other method can perform the task without risk of peripheral damage to the valuable stuff that we tradesmen and tradeswomen have to cut into. Fein blades are like auto insurance; they are an expensive burden when you don't need them but when you do. you will be very glad that you have them."
5,"These are great strings. They are the right length and go on easy enough. They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on. sound bright. and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever. you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less. that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book. Worth the extra pesos."
10,"This finish sander just isn't up to Makita's standards.  It works well when new. but lacks durability.  Even in a non-professional setting. it just doesn't last.  The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place.  The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order.  It does sand well. I just wish it was more solidly built.  If you need a solid finish sander. you're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models."
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
4,"This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass. not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind. it is quite inventive.Where did he get his red suit?Why does he go down the Chimney?What about his reindeer and his 'Ho Ho Ho'?These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. but it is done well enough."
11,"With this kit you or your child(ren) can write up to 12 pages of text. each with its own illustration. send it off to the company. and receive a professionally printed hardbound book in a few weeks.  There are even options to get gift books. each with its own unique dedication page!  An 'About the Author' section really personalizes the experience.Everything you need is in the kit -- instructions. paper (including practice sheets) and pens.  There's even a postage-paid envelope. so when you're finished writing you can just drop it into a mailbox.  We could not be happier with this product.  It was fun and easy. brought out the kids' imagination. and the product we received was beautifully finished.Highest recommendation."
9,"I bought this to mount on my muzzle loader. It has the ideal magnification for deer hunting in heavy cover where things tend to get up-close and personal.  At the price I paid I didn't expect to get much more than the minimum.  This scope is much better than the minimum.  Light transmission and clarity are way above average.  The size is just right and the build quality is terrific.  My boom stick kicks like a mule but the scope hold it's zero tenaciously. I wish I needed two."
9,"I bought a few of these for my family.  I think I still prefer the rally over this model since it gets rid of the scissors and adds a screwdriver instead.  Still. there is a reason why this is a &#34;classic&#34;!  You won't be disappointed with this small keychain knife.  I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys.  The one keyring it comes with will cause the knife to sit perpendicular to your keys. adding bulk."
3,"In these stories everybody smokes.  The courtesy of offering a pack of cigarettes is common. The characters are classic 50s people. as are the social proprieties. The illustrations are highly representative of the 50s science/fiction dime novel. and the magazines of that time. Although he was not the first to deal with the principle of multiple time lines. I think he was the first to base a series of stories on the concept. These have not aged well. but the science behind these stories are still valid. I will have to admit I read these stories after Fuzzy Sapiens. his masterpiece. and one of the top books of all time. certainly in this genre. We lost a great storyteller prematurely when he left us."
8,"We were having a grand time with this toy. and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance.  That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who &#34;Chucked it&#34; as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever... Ok. so that's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there. but buyer beware: You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car.  It really depends on where you live."
3,"I have never read this author but I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would gladly read another.The disfigured Hero's fear. pain and pride were wonderfully described and I felt myself wanting to reach out and gently touch his scars to reassure him -at exactly the same times Aidan touched Warwick. Don't get me wrong. Warwick was a brutally strong hot male character-but we were so privy to his thoughts within this story that we began to get those protective feelings Aidan acquired. We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you! She is a one WOMAN rescue squad that is the perfect match for our mysterious- masked hired guard Warwick. The sex between them is hot and wicked as well.enjoy!"
3,"This was an excellent. fast paced story that I didn't want to put down.There is a small issue with formatting that I almost deducted a star for. but I just couldn't do it as it did not hinder my reading much at all. It's only a matter of sentences dropping to a new line in the middle and not having page breaks between chapters.  Annoying. but not debilitating.The characters here are vivid and believable. The writing is succinct and graphic.This was a steal for $.99. I will definitely be watching out for more from this author."
4,"There's so much debate about the violence of this movie that it may scare some from watching it. But Mel Gibson makes it known that he doesn't want to elaborate on the physical suffering of Jesus as much as he wants to elaborate on the courage and strength of Jesus to do God's will. Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe. But the last scene of Jesus resurrection gives hope and almost purges those feelings of despair. This movie depicts true Love and Hope through even the most darkest hours. Other than some rather cheesy scenes and some overdramatic irony the movie should remain a classic for it's indie aspirations and block buster accomplishments."
9,"I have carried one of these on my belt for over 25 years and recently left mine on the tailgate of my pickup and drove off without thinking. I lasted three days bare of my Victorinox and couldn't go any longer. The price is a little spendy but trust me you won't even give it a second thought after you use this tool for a month. It is extremely well made. engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants. I don't go 24 hours that I don't use this tool at least a half dozen times. It has it all and then some. The steel in the blades is exquisite. The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp. I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw. Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime."
8,"This is my second review for Duckworth and I still feel that this duck is worth every penny. It was the favorite toy of our dog that died at age 13 and it is the favorite toy of our 5 yr old dog that we adopted after the first one died. The dogs couldn't be more different in personality. but they both have loved this toy to pieces. literally. It doesn't get chewed apart but is so well loved that it looks terrible and is starting to fall apart. so we buy two each Christmas and save the second one for mid summer when it is time for a new Duckworth to appear."
5,"Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar. and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway. it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands. but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
5,"I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use. I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own. And every student I've ever had. has one on their guitar as well. They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding. They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time. they can be easily removed and relocated. After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. No matter how many picks you store. or for how long. the spring action loader never loses its resistance. I highly recommend these. I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product. If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks. this is the product for you."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
6,"I think it's a little pricey for 200 sheets. but then again with Prime that includes 'free' shipping.  We use a ton of paper at our tutoring center. and I prefer the wide ruled for my students. especially the ones in elementary school.  The wide ruled lines give the young writers more room to express themselves in words and numbers.  For math activities I'll sometimes turn the paper horizontal with the lines running up and down. This can help students visualize columns and be better able to list numbers one below the other.These sheets of paper have red margins on both sides for convenience of application. For those who look for it. the Mead filler paper has the  certified sourcing imprimatur."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
3,"Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends. werewolves. vampires. the like. as beings of an alternate dimension. Gates allow them passage to out world. Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down. building such as Stonehenge. the Indian mounds of the Americas. and other such structures around the world. But as humans spread and built. those impediments were destroyed. weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world. In their own dimension. they are far down the food chain. In our world. they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing. cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests. cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains. there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families. the Masons. from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event. and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
6,"This is traditional wide-ruled. three-hole paper. Exactly the quality you expect from Mead--decent thickness with clear. crisp lines and edges--and ideal for grade-school to middle-school writers. If wide-ruled notebook paper is what you. or your child. needs. this is as good as. or better than. any other option. With one caveat ... It's the kind of thing best bought on sale. because off-season or single pack purchase can be absurdly pricey: 4 to 5 times the price of the same goods at better times (like back to school events)."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together. it shows up very easily on gift wrap. being all shiny.  The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts..  doesnt attract or reflect light. so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape. Very simple and it works.Con:  this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use. but it can be used as such.  Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
4,"Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai."
1,"I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks.  I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month.  That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back.  What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same. 1800. and my body. which fights me to gain. will be happy with the lower weight.  One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol. it's doesn't work anymore.  I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis.  I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate."
1,"Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos. with sound. field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years. and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine. fast. priced fair. new in the package."
5,"My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones. I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars. The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage.One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely. but works with the others flawlessly. I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it's price. To me. the warranty is worth it because of the price. I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality. but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion."
3,"For whatever reason. Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The 'Tales of...' are great in that they explain background characters. However.Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work. this is mostly a book of action. not intricate plot development. In fact. the story ends with an exciting twist. but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love. or included a really interesting plot twist. Also. just to note. this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version."
8,"THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS!  I bought this for my Airedale's crate at night.  I thought it would be nice to radiate a little heat  (during these chilly winter months)  under her top towel. and on top of her cushion and blanket.  SHE LOVES IT. and has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning!!!  This disc is very hard. but she doesn't seem to mind (and I put it under a thick towel).  It actually stays warm for about 8-10 hours.  and I microwave only 5 mins and 15 secs. which is slightly under the recommended time for my microwave.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
3,"After seeing the recent major movie. I was prompted to pursue re-reading the original series of novels. I found them to be highly entertaining and as captivating as when I read them long ago. The writing is good. if a bit 'dated'. but Burroughs can still hold your attention. His writting may seem a little juvenile to some but I (at 70+) was thrilled time and again as I read them on my KIndle. I recommend them to all who simply wish to read a series purely for the entertainment value."
9,"It is convenient and packs up well for car camping.  The stove gets very hot. and is great for boiling water.The stove does not do 'simmer' particularly well.  Be careful with anything that needs lower heat settings.  Using a cast iron pan or high quality aluminum or copper clad pan helps.  Attempting pancakes. eggs or a side dish requires very close attention.I would say that overall this is a good value. but there are better units available.It does have good wind resistance to it. which is a definite plus outside."
10,"Other reviewers are correct. this is a terrific little sander with one problem. the switch is tricky to operate.  The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best.  Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task. this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production.  Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent. noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders.  I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable (with no dust collection) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC.  Highly recommended."
8,"If my dogs like like the taste of Purina One and they eat it. then there is not more that I can say except I trust Purina products. I am always looking out for the best products at a reasonable price and through the years Purina products have provided food that is healthy and balanced. at a reasonable price. and most importantly. my animals like the taste. Most of our dogs and cats live to their teen years. with two of our cats living to 19 and 20 years old. this I think I it in part due to Purina products."
12,"I bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience.  I was not disappointed.  It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless. since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also. the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me. mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better. but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall. a very simplistic. yet functional. design that works well."
8,"My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT.  Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received.  The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal.  It is all angular and sharp points. My dog wouldn't even touch it.  She even know the difference.This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we wouldn't know the difference.  I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them.  From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance.  Very upset with this kind of business practice.  All nylabone products ARE NOT equal."
8,"I use it to pre-treat my carpet in heavy stained spots. but it's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there. Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again (no way. it takes too much time). I just spray this and clean it off. I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula. not to mention its scent is even better. If you own a puppy or a pet that isn't fully housebroken yet. buy it. You'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner."
5,"Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder... Aquila seems to be the most popular now. I have used both and I am satisfied with both...I play the soprano. concert. tenor. and baritone. Each one different in it on right...Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO.  Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times:))))"
4,"This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful.  For many. myself included. the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity.  The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify. and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith.  Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible. gritty reality.  This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment. not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.  I am not a Christian. but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film.  This is not a film to 'enjoy.' but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind."
9,"tips:1. the lantern burns brighter on white Coleman fuel2. gasoline is A LOT more dirty then Coleman fuel so try to pre-filter the gas before use.3.gasoline will gum up the lantern in storage VERY quickly.so dump out the gasoline after your use.4.if you burn gasoline a lot make sure to pack an extra generator(a lantern part)because they tend to plug up much quicker then with Coleman fuel. the generator is cleanable if soaked in parts cleaner or 'seafoam'.5. if you need 'directional light' cut a thick foil pie pan to the same dimensions as the globe.but make it only wrap half way around the globe(it will stay in place by being pinched between the shade and the mantel metal bottom. this will give you about 200 watts of directed light....perfect for Sasquatch hunting or signaling the mother-ship.that being said; these are great lanterns and simple enough to repair and pass down to your kids....a rare product characteristic nowadays."
12,"This game was a very fun game. You basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings.. each one leading you into a different world... and in every world... you have to find 7 stars... (one of em is the 100 coin star where you need to collect 100 coins then it pops up it's the hardest star to get)there's 16 worlds in all... most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it.. This game right here is history... It's one of Nintendo's biggest hits... and when you buy this game you'll soon find out why:)"
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
1,"The National Brand of the best working Lactase Tablets - they get the job done--i.e. preventing embarassing dashes for the nearest lavatory. which can be a pain if you're taking the train. particularly as it tends to be rather drafty in there and on cold mornings any trip where one has to run down a long series of connecting cars just to partially disrobe to read a newspaper and pretend that's all you went there for- which allows you to be comfortable and not have to make the weaving sway-bumping into others -as you fairly leap down the cars to the necessary--only to find it &#34;occupied&#34; - is a good thing to have on hand to use instead- make sure you take it WITH the dairy product - not after and not more than 1 minute before eating ...(heed my advice on this -or- don't say i didn't warn you)."
6,"I've loved the trimline phone ever since I got my first phone more than 20 years ago.  Then. the trimline was a real. Bell System. telephone.  Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones. it still has the great. comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset. which makes it an excellent choice.  I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone. but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T; version.If you read the other reviews. you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.  Yet. here we are in late November 2004. and its still around.  I'm guessing (could be wrong here) that this phone will be around forever. even though AT&T; no longer promotes it on their web-site."
5,"I bought this set mainly because I wanted a cheap micro-fiber cloth to polish off my guitars.  For the price of just a microfiber cloth. this set throws in a polish.The cloth is just what I wanted. It is soft and I feel good rubbing it on my instrument. I wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate -- mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear.  The polish is just that -- it is works to bring out a shine. but it is not a cleaner.  You also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish; there is a bit of wax in there and it is not string-friendly."
3,"This story is very short (think novella). but it it's very well-written and the plot moves at a nice. quick pace. This is a great. easy read for a few hours (especially for the beach or that plane trip).The story revolves around an estranged couple. a misunderstanding. and a cute and funny revelation at the end.I don't really understand the negative/mediocre reviews. because I personally loved this story.  I get that everyone has their own opinion. but if you're a fan of adult historical fiction. you will definitely enjoy this!"
3,"The story idea was sweet. with a hunky editor who is trying to convince his prized writer to start writing erotic novels.  Given that this is a new genre for her. they engage in a little erotic research under the premise of helping her writing.  I liked the characters and the scenarios. but I expected a bit more eroticism and a little less sweet.  It seemed as though the sex scenes were a bit on the vanilla side compared to other books in this genre.  Still. a light and entertaining read."
9,"People complain about the lavender smell.  Yes it is STRONG when you smell right from the bottle.  Actually using it as a soap/shampoo it leaves a very faint smell.  You just have a nice clean smell with a hint of the lavender.  I have used Dove body wash for years and this is a much better product.  It doesn't have the lotion that products like Dove contain. but it has a really nice. clean. refreshing feel and smell that is hard to beat.  No lotion-like residue like the Dove... but still the skin is pretty moisturized.It doesn't foam up quite as much as most commercial soaps. but you actually use about the same. or less. of this product to get the same level of cleanliness.  Plus being fair trade. environmentally friendly. and having an ingredient list that is actually comprehensible is a huge plus.I will never go back to Dove... and will stick with this unless I end up finding something superior."
5,"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo. but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos.  important to take it off when not in use so the 'rubber' does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another."
6,"The tape - at first I wondered: 'How can this be different?'. The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss (satin if you will) finish. For a 'tape collector' I guess it is slightly between 'magic' and clear tape.* Not a big deal to me and most people. but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered 'photo safe' I guess that means it won't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has."
4,"Are we Jaded? Rate this product. . . We EXPECT what we purchases to BE.  To work without difficulty. without oops. without interruptions. to provide the intended use. When we receive and get the EXPECTED. we might sigh a sigh of satisfaction. More often we might not even raise an eye brow.

1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper. Shadow. Axel. and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm. remote detonator. and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
8,"We have used Frontline Plus for several years on our dogs and never had an issue.  Never seen a single flea or tick on them.  I have a lab who loves to dig and roll around in the grass and sand. and I haven't had any problems.  Last year we decided to try the new generic equivalent to save a few bucks since we are buying for 2 dogs.  BIG mistake.  We pulled off several ticks.  As soon as we could. we went right back to FP and haven't looked back.  It is worth the little extra money (there is not THAT huge of a difference in price) to be sure our dogs are safe from fleas. ticks and all the other nasties out there."
1,"I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War. many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door. I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor. a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;"
1,"Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating; he was so grateful; 'He was like Mom it really does work. thank you!'  Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago. raising young children. working and just don't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems.  Anyway. it worked for him...Be sure that whom ever uses this product. that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1. Use at night before bed (do this twice in a row)2. Then use every other nightDon't quote me verbatim. just read the direction for yourself before using. as I'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product.  If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product...Good Luck!"
12,"This is the origanal Gameboy Color its not some crappy SP this was amazing due to all the colors on the screen and the size was better than a gamegear for sure. Most of the titles are great and take full advantage of the colors  many people say that it's not that great only because there is no backlight.but who cares anyone remember the Gameboy Light? And how did that turn out. horrible nintendo did mot want to take another risk like that and they were right backlights and graphics don't make a game console*cough gamegear cough* its the games for the console and these games are awesome so if you want dust off your old library of Gameboy color games go for it youll be sorry if you don't"
1,"B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device. which puts others to shame.  In fact. the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used. but even at first brush. it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it. and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you. Amazon. for making this available to me at an 'irreteethable' price."
1,"I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others. I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer. so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more. you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation."
9,"This thing is amazing! I go on river floats basically every other weekend in the summer and this is used as the beer barge where we keep our shoes. coolers. keys etc. Not only does it admirably hold all the weight loaded into it. it has so far remained completely damaged even though people repeatedly throw crushed beer cans and bottle caps in it. I've only used it a couple times as a person floater but it had ample space for me (6'2&#34; -185lbs) and I didn't feel like it was going to sink. I've also not used the oars yet. If I were going to make this purchase again. I probably would look at getting something that could hold two people for me and a friend to go play around in the creeks etc but I'm not sure that they make anything as cheap as I want that does all that. I highly recommend this boat and the full Intex line to anyone looking for river float craft."
9,"I like the Speedo Hydrospex Swim Goggles. They have a snug. relatively comfortable (for googles) fit and won't leak if you follow the instructions on the package. These Speedos look good in the water and provide decent visibility. I find the tinted versions too dark to see underwater.  I have used these clear goggles for a year now. and after about 30 uses.  there are no durability issues so far. These are nice goggles at an affordable price. better than the cheap ones I had as a kid that leaked all the time!"
3,"Rachel has come back to Cougar Falls in search of a new beginning. The legacy from her beloved Aunt Charlotte couldn't have come at a more fitting time.Burke Chastell just wants Rachel to collect her inheritance and sell him the land so they can find the totem that protects Cougar Falls before the rest of the world discovers not only that it exists. but all of its secrets.Rachel's Totem by Marie Harte is HOT!  I enjoyed this story more than expected. Since it is part of an ongoing series. I was afraid I would be lost and confused. but I wasn't. I had no problem following the story and motivations of the characters. There was an unexpected m&eacute;nage. but it was definitely a fun one. I will be checking out more of Ms. Harte's stories after this one.Elysiareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
5,"I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes. plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to. is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly. there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6' pop filter.  If you don't. you'll wish you did."
6,"Make note that this product is for laser printers!  Great product for office or at home use.  If you have a mass mailing to do. you will find Avery templates and labels extremely useful.  These products come with Easy Peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier.  Anytime you have to print labels. look to these Avery labels.  A good value for your money.  You can address 750 envelopes with just one package.  Do you know how much time mail merge. a printer. and some avery labels will save you.  You won't be disappointed!"
3,"GREAT ADDITION TO THE LEARNING CURVE OF THE KINDLE.  Just finished reading the third edition of this book. I was surprised about the little tidbits that I didn't know about!!! My Kindle is used only for downloading books via either my computer or Whispernet from Amazon and of course reading them. I am not interested in using the Kindle for anything else so a lot of the book does not apply to my uses. But those that do are worth the small amount charged for this book. It is a bargain. Even my dogs are happy that I have converted over to the  Kindle since the pathways they use were growing smaller with each new book brought home."
4,"I was pleased to see in the extra features that Dr. Ben Carson was on-hand to advise in the production of this biographical retelling of his autobiography. He is a gifted speaker and writer. but I had hoped that they got the story right. Read the book first if you can; it's a page-turner. The movie leaves out some of the faith stories of Dr. Carson. making it a draw to a wider audience. But make no mistake. Dr. Carson credits God with all of his success. pointing out that it was his Christ-following mother that prayed for and encouraged him to reach his potential. taking him to church and teaching him in the way he should go--even as a single parent."
12,"This game is really fun. but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more. One thing that annoys me about this game is that you can't look behind you. I pressed every button and I can't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming. So nine out of ten times. I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64? It's still a nice little game. a little pricey. but still nice to have in your N64 collection."
10,"Great miter saw.  Lots of capacity and lots of nice features.  The tall sliding fence is great. just make sure to slide it out of the way during bevel cuts.  The supplied blade is fine for general work but youll want to upgrade if you plan on doing any work requiring a quality cut.  This saw is easy to adjust. just read the manual as it tells you how to adjust everything on the saw.  Adjusting it took me all of five minutes and has stayed true ever since.  My only gripes concern the cost of the accessories.  They are ridiculously expensive and should be included considering the price of this saw.  I also recomend purchasing this saw at your local home center as DeWalts packaging jobs leaves a lot to be desired. One piece of cardboard is all that secures this big saw inside the box.  Other than those minor gripes this is the best 12' saw on the market."
3,"This book was my least favorite of the series. It was lacking detail in the beginning and the heroine's purpose seemed too manufactured to me. I also couldn't get my head wrapped around the alternating first and third person accounts chapter to chapter. The static characters were a little too static for me (there could have been a little more explanation for some of the behaviors or snootier snubs. And none of them ever really seemed to be resolved).The ending seemed a little scraped together as well. Having already read others in the series. I know this is just a fluke. I will say I liked the characters though. in better development of their back stories or resolutions I would have been more apt to give four stars. Still. it was a decent read. But not one I would be in a hurry to re-read."
3,"All in all a great read. I would have given this book five stars except there were some repetitive thought processes in the beginning that had me saying 'alright already - I get it... he wants to stay but he's afraid she'll recognize him and reject him or turn him in'. (reminders would have been okay. but perhaps less wordy ones) However. by nearly half way in the book it moves away from that. There's plenty of action and suspense throughout. and a nice romance to boot."
4,"The acting was fine. but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown. covered with blood. hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone. Jesus Christ or anybody else. taking such an ass kicking. What was it. 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here. Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh. there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds. sunlight through a hole in his hand. Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday."
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
4,"This is a great Woody Allen film.However. it is only 85 minutes long. just like every other release.The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.It is widescreen. but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.All special features are only written text and only in Korean. so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.It is not.It is. however. a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release."
5,"Long story short. this string set has a strong metallic character. which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it. but for me. absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar. so by its nature it sounds mellow. warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out. I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position. WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes. it is that bad. you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line. I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so. definitely avoid this string."
10,"I purchased this sander nearly one year ago and can't say I have any complaints about it. The dust collection works surprisingly well. though if the bag isn't pushed in all the way it has a tendency to fall out (fault of the user. not the tool). It isn't unbearably loud although I still wear my ear muffs when using it. The vibration in the hand is low. and it does a superb job at what it is designed to do - sand. I don't know where the components are made. but at least the tool itself is assembled in USA which is more than I can say for the 18V Li-Ion drill and impact driver combo that I have as well (Makita brand) which is made in China. This is a purchase you won't regret."
6,"I never oiled my previous shredder and paid the price after about a year.  This time I bought the oil at the same time I bought the shredder.  Now I oil the shredder fairly often. maybe even too often.  The only issue I have with this product is that it's a bit messy when you &#34;pour&#34; the oil onto the shredder blades.  I cut the top of the oil container as small as I could. but oil still manages to come out too fast and get on the shredder body when I oil.  No big deal as I just wipe the excess with a paper towel. but it's worth noting."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
4,"After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions. and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three. but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks...."
6,"This is easily the best gift wrapping tape I have ever used. It is transparent. of course. but not shiny. like some competing brands I have used. UnlikeScotch Magic(TM) Tape 810-3PK. 3/4-inch x 1296 Inches. 3-Pack(which is also fantastic). this tape doesn't look cloudy on top of wrapping paper; it really is just hard to see. The adhesive is strong enough to hold gift wrap together. but is also forgiving enough to allow you to peel it off and readjust if need to. All in all. this is a great product."
3,"Many post apocalyptic stories are very grim. This one isn't. It has a lovely cast of characters. of beings who are trying to build new lives.The pace of the story is easy. like walk on the beach. The story starts with a wolf/human who is banished because the elders of his tribe are afraid of his ideas. On his journey he meets others: a young boy. an orphan and artist. whose body is damaged by the pollution of his former city and a female dolphin/siryn who has been helping the boy to survive and of course a very intelligent dog that they name Misschief.Many other new characters are slowly introduced.The book is infused with the love and healing power of nature. The characters are well defined and they all have a purpose. that they gradually discover."
6,"This 3 Ring Binder is well designed. Avery took what is wrong with most other binders and came up with excellent solutions such as the Pins for the Binder Ring connections. Other binders use V connections which don't always work well. I also like the Single Button to release the Rings. The curvature of the Rings makes it easier to handle large volumes of paper.The Labels are also Premium quality but I won't be using them with a printer or the free Avery software. Only reason is that I don't make that many Binder labels at any one time. But I have used other Avery label products with Avery's free software and they always worked well.If you want an above average 3 Ring Binder that can be used frequently and smoothly then I highly recommend this Avery product."
8,"I typically pre-treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning.  This is a ok pre-treat but I likeBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 ozbetter.  I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge.  I've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time.  For lighter carpets. I would recommend theBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 oz."
3,"I became attached to the characters. I liked the series for the most part. I only had 2 complaints. The characters kept saying that they weren't monsters. that they are the same people they were before immortality (which I agree). However. the author kept calling it the dark gift. I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing. I'm not sure how to put into words. but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example. Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this. I got the point the 1st 2 times they explained their thoughts and feelings.  For the most part. I liked the series. Just these 2 points bothered me."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
2,"I've been using this almost daily for about a month. Easy to use. easy to clean. and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints. except that the bowl feels kind of thin. like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl. but I guess only time will tell. Other than that. no complaints. and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up. and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it. but hindsight is 20/20."
10,"I had this for my first table saw when I started woodworking. No matter how long I spent adjusting it. I couldn't get the rear of the fence to lock solid. or to lock in the same place every time. VERY frustrating when you're trying to make pieces of plywood with square corners.This is not the same caliber tool as Makita's hand tools.It may work OK for carpenters. but compared to woodworking. they don't need any kind of precision. For that. a good contractor saw like a Jet would be good. But do spend the money for the upgraded fence. The stock fences on those are garbage too. If you really need a lightweight. compact saw. look at the DeWalt and the Bosch."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
2,"If you're not a cook. then you probably won't have a use for this. but anyone in the search of a superior vegetable peeler. look no further. I've had mine for over two years. and it's working as well as the day I purchased it. It doesn't dull. it peels efficiently. it's safe. light. easy to handle. easy to clean. and doesn't rust. It works well with potatoes. carrots. cucumbers. and zucchinis. I've never tried chocolate. though. It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try. I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,"I was totally amazed to find out this uses NiCad batteries that suffer from battery memory and are horrid.  I had to call Eureka and get new batteries sent. the first customer service agent was horrible and made me call back 24 hours later in the event the batteries suddenly started to work.  NiCad batteries are horrible.  The Vac itself is great. but the batteries make it not worth owning.Among rechargeable battery technologies. NiCad rapidly lost market share in the 1990's. to NiMH and Li-ion batteries; market share dropped by 80% for good reason.  With the battery technology today there is no reason Eureka should have used them except to be cheap."
5,"I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD&G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great. I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing."
5,"I bought this recently and I love it. Why?  It has no &#34;smell&#34;. it leaves no residue on your hands. it's very &#34;light&#34; but yet it cleans. shines. and polishes your guitar beautifully.  It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish. it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors. This is fantastic stuff. If you own a guitar this is the best product out there. But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson. I was very suprised that it was this effective. This little bottle goes a long way. I have already polished all of my guitars and my friend's guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left. If you need to polish your guitar look no further. This is your best choice."
6,"It might seem silly to be excited about labels but I am. I've been looking for labels that aren't a pain in the you-know-what and I've found them.These labels are return address label sized (80/sheet). I'll be using them for that as well but my initial use is for 'reorder' labels on products I sell. The printing is clear and smudge-proof. important for labels with small print that might be exposed to liquids or creams.What I like best about these is the Easy Peel feature. which will save much time and aggravation when I'm label several items (or envelopes) at once. I'll be ordering these again but with 80 labels per sheet. it may be a while."
5,"I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  I guess this kit works okay. but it's hard to use.  It will probably last my entire lifetime.  I think a smaller kit would have been better.  You really need to remove the strings when you use it. so you have to take off all the strings.  I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings. so I had to change my habits.  If you have a guitar without a truss rod. that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings. since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time. and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  I'm no expert. but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  However. since I love my guitar. I use it anyway."
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
9,"I've owned my XLT since shortly after it came out. and it is absolutely the best knife I've ever owned. even better than the SwissChamp I'd carried for 10 years prior.  I work as a computer tech. and this knife has about 90% of the tools I need to fix a computer. all in a (relatively) small package that I can carry in my pocket.  It's got things like Torx and Hex bits. and the bit driver is exactly the perfect size for tightening the little nuts on either side of a D-SUB connector (VGA. Parallel. Serial port. etc).  Even the little straight pin has come in handy for resetting PDAs.  I have used every single tool on this knife except the fish scaler.  Heck. even the toothpick has proven useful!"
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
2,"I live in an apartment. so I wanted something that I could hang over the door instead of drilling/nailing things into the wall for me to fill later when I move out. It was really hard to find! This comes with the hardware to mount if you want to. which is nice if/when I go somewhere more permanent. but honestly. hanging it over the door is working great. Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part. I ended up using a hammer which caused some of the white paint to come off. but you really can't see it and it doesn't affect function. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
8,"My mom's beloved Bichon Frise is the family pet.  The grandchildren all love her and we'd be lost without her.  Unfortunately. she is highly allergic to flea bites.  She also cannot tolerate a flea collar.  We have tried everything for this poor. sensitive dog and finally found Frontline Plus!  We apply it every 45 days because she's mainly an indoor dog and only goes out for using the bathroom.  The vet suggested every 45 days because of her sensitivities.  It works wonders!  We just started using it May of this year (2008) and she has not had a single reaction to fleas for the first time in the 10 years she's been alive.Every dog should have Frontline Plus applied to keep them flea free!  We no longer have to put her on allergy medication.  It's been such a wonderful product for her."
5,"Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board. this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs. combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further. with the transformer being well away from the board. there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?"
10,"I have two desktop high intensity lamps - one I bought a few years ago. and one a recent purchase. The older lamp failed about 3 months ago. and I replaced it with the new one thinking the older one was finished. Then when the newer lamp blew a bulb I decided to get a set of these bulbs to see if it would work again. Replacing the blown bulb with a new one from this package took a minute or two (being careful not to touch the bulb with my fingers). and the new lamp was back to working. So I decided to try one these bulbs in my old (presumed dead) desk lamp. After carefully installing the new bulb my old lamp was back to life. They are both still working. and I am delighted with this purchase."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
2,"It's a stick vacuum. folks. So it won't do much more on carpet than collect surface debris (like any stick vac. it's not designed to. though it does have a &#34;carpet&#34; setting) or solve big cleaning problems. But it will. from solid floors. remove crumbs. most dust bunnies smaller than bowling balls. dog and cat hair. and -- for those like us who have canaries or other pet birds -- all 2.000 feathers that each one of those little darlings drops during their annual molt.What I like best is that this model comes with TWO batteries. so I can keep one in the stick vac and one in the charger so the help I need is always at hand. For the price. I like this machine."
2,"I've used a Premium grade. Innova 8 Qt. for years. It is way too big for every day. single person use. The Presto works decently. but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop. catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid. the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height. the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top. but not the sides."
10,"I purchased this saw because I was building a 600 sq ft deck and really needed something that would work well. What a great investment this was. I can't begin to tell you how many pieces of wood we had to cut and the saw did it with ease. I am extremely happy with the results and very happy that I followed the reviews of others before I purchased the saw. Even after completing the deck. I still don't even have to change the blade. I also purchased the reciprocating saw from DeWalt which also worked great. You get what you pay for and it's worth every penny. especially when you don't have tax or delivery."
3,"I liked the premise behind the plot. mental attachment between wolf and man. as I like this type of interaction. Unfortunately. for me. the original promise of the plot never quite materialized and in fact ended up being chaotic for me with an unexpected side-step into shape shifting halfway through the book.For me. the book almost works well but doesn't quite make it. The plot premise didn't deliver quite what I anticipated. the characterization was a little predictable with secondary characters not well developed as individuals.I did finish the book but admit to skimming quite a lot of the last half. It wasn't a bad book. just not  my kind of read. Bland would probably be the best way to describe the book for me."
9,"If you Want a decent scope that can stand the pounding it takes from a .308. then this is your scope. I previously bought a Barska scope that  shook to pieces after 12 shots.  After 3 hours of shooting. and more than 60 rounds. I shot my best pattern of the day at 100 yards. and I am not that great a shot ! The adjustments are not as smooth as a $4.000 scope. bit it is not a 4k scope. and bottom line is. it worked fine for me. Two thumbs up For Bushnell."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
9,"Just so nobody gets confused here. this is a very small pocket knife. To be worn on a key chain. Nothing remotely what is considered EDC (every day carry). But here is why I got it: You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc. Scissors. a nail file and what I like the best....tweezers and a toothpick. None of the high priced Leatherman etc. multitools have tweezers. and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be."
4,"If you want to view an interpretation of Christ that reduces him to little more than a helpless idiot. watch this movie.  If you actually respect him. avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing. then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here. he is portrayed as a victim. dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there. just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message. love. pacificm. or teachings. it's a sensationalist view of his suffering. which doesn't fit well with the Christ story."
4,"Kudos to RareFlixNClassic for reliable and expedeiant service. ordered (03 March 2010) same time as other products. I recieved this one 9 March 2010 and as of 10 March 2010 Amazon still has not shipped the other iteams oreder with this one. All with the super saver shipping including this one. Quick shipping. Recieved product as advetised in new condition. The movie it self is a classic anti culture movie ot its time. I like the movie for what it is and you get to see Nickolsen from his earlyer years in the buissness."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
12,"Probably one of the best games for RPG players.  However. too expensive currently (as of August 2006).  I bought the PC version and the Playstation version years back and still have them.  The PC version does look better especially during fight scenes.  Unfortunately. for use on Windows XP you have to get a software patch for later in the game (chocobo race).  Great great game.  I would say 'shame on you' to the sellers that are charging so much for the games but I understand their reasons.Find it cheap. buy it. play it. enjoy it!"
4,"The informational content is superb but it is presented in a combination of psudeo talk show and lecture format. In addition. Mr. Barton speaks very fast and dispenses a large volume of information in a short amount of time. The result is that the episodes tend to be dry and boring. Adding to these difficulties is the fact the DVDs include the promotions for the series from when it aired on TV. As a result the episodes are interupted approximately every 8 minutes with what amounts to a commercial for the series. This gets exceptionally tiring after a short period of time. While I would wish that every high school student in the nation along and every adult citizen study this series. I think that anyone who is not seriously interested in the subject matter will find watching it to be a tedious affair."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
9,"This pedometer has a clock which resets the count every day and keeps a seven day history.  I just leave it on my belt and don't have to worry about resetting it or checking it right after a walk.  My wife has a pedometer with manual reset and she never remembers to use it.The sensitivity adjustment helps avoid false readings from car vibrations. and the aerobic steps feature is useful to determine how much exercise I'm actually getting.It is very durable.  I've worn it every day for over a year with no problems.  It also has a small enough size that I hardly notice when I'm wearing it.In summary. the combination of durability. features. size. and price makes the Omron HJ-105 an excellent choice."
2,"I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules. you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally. it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA. otherwise. highly recommend."
4,"Woody Allen's directorial debut. and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know. he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered. this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure. it has some korean styled packaging. but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie. not a commercial movie.  Beware. this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap."
6,"I recently went through my filing cabinet and purged all of the old crap that was cluttering the drawers.  The problem is that I now had a stack of very usable folders that were 'tattooed' by the old labels.  You can't tear the old labels off without damaging the tab and if you put new labels over them the writing on the old label shows through.These new Avery File Folder Labels are absolutely perfect for this situation: you can place them over old labels and they completely block out the writing on the old labels.  Problem solved!!Nice and heavy-duty. these are excellent labels.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day. so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say. Hi!') feel free to post it below.Thanks.Claire"
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
9,"I picked this multitool because it has the best combination of features for me: I really like having a saw. phillips head and scissors. All of the tools are well designed. The saw cuts aggressively in both directions and all of the blades came paper slicing sharp and are easy to restore. It is also surprisingly lightweight for its size; unlike Leathermans which are also great but for different reasons. If I had any complaints it would be that some of the tools are slightly difficult to access (particularly the hook - which I don't use anyways) and I think that there is space for one more tool on the bottom."
3,"I thought this would be a great book after reading the description.  But. the author has put way too much filler in and that just turned me off. There are also lots of misinformation as to how things work out. For example:  He ambled!  Her senses hummed.  Women don't growl in dismay. they likely would sign or moan. Men don't glide. cattle bawl. they don't bray.  Mules and donkey bray!  And on and on.  I think the author had a good idea for a story. but she just had a first novel or juvenile attempt at this one. I got it free and I am happy at that.  Cannot recommend it.  Explicit sex is also a turn off."
10,"This drill is an absolute work horse.  Besides doing lots of hole drilling in different materials. I've used this drill to mix thinset mortar. grout. and joint compound....it just churns away and barely gets warm.  After burning up two Dewalt drills. I decided to go with Milwaukee.  The keyed chuck is the best on the market and you never need to worry about it slipping once you've secured it properly.  The drill has a lot of torque. so use the additional handle and hold on tight!  Great drill....great price!"
5,"In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality. I've never broken or worn out the capo. I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars. The spring tension remains strong after several years. which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing. The only problem I have with them. they seem to disappear when I'm not looking. I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use. Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty. it cleans easily."
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
4,"Love seeing these cartoons in PERFECT re-mastered condition and bright colors.  Over the years. they have aired on channels including CARTOON NETWORK in washed out 16mm prints.  I would have preferred that the original titles remain. BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode.  All in all...a GREAT DVD set!  For this box set. CLASSIC MEDIA also re-did the covers for VOLUME 1 &amp; 2 and they are much IMPROVED!  Rick Goldschmidt  RANKIN/BASS Historian"
5,"Well built.  The adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about 8 or 9 degree increments.  (10 possible positions between upright and horizontal)  Best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck. I'm using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the  stand to give  me a bit more room.  But there is no counter-weight here so its best used at shallow angles.  If I was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar. or if on-stage energy has you moving a lot more. I would opt for a boom stand instead."
9,"These are hands down the best kids goggles out there as they stay put on little faces.  The large coverage area also seems to give kids more security in the water and also leaves less chances of them falling off.  The material is tacky without being sticky. which is great for holding on to little kids in motion.  The many colors are also nice so that each kid can have their own color.  They aren't indestructible and the lens can scratch so a bit of care is a good idea. but as far as kids goggles go. this is a good investment to make."
2,"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup. 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen."
9,"As a shampoo it's great. although my hair feels rubbery during the first lather after the second and a towel dry it feels really soft. If you have to shampoo regularly. every other day should be fine with this stuff.As a body wash it's great. the tingle is really noticeable...especially if you leave the lather in between your legs for too long it can get uncomfortably tingly so unless that's your thing. beware.It lasts a LOOOONG time. It's called magic because of how easily the oil lathers up. half a palm full should be enough to wash your hair and body easily.The smell is pretty strong compared to the others but I'm pretty sure it depends on the batch. the bottle I'm using now isn't overpowering but a lot of people have gotten bottles with too much peppermint"
2,"No assembly and ready to go out of box.  2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.  Unit does not have to be disassembled to empty. a convenient drain spout.After first use. waste water came out black. and an immediate elimination of pet odor in the stairway.Small size and light weight make it idea for immediate spill clean ups.Unit is built top heavy with a large handle. this balances the weight when solution is in the unit.Cord could be longer and retractable."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
9,"This ball provides grip and feel for ball handlers and shooters with a composite cover material.  I have 2 boys that lllooovvvvee basketball and this ball is their favorite.  This ball emulates the feel of leather. that also offers the durability need for mixed surface use. It seems like they had ball handlers and shooters in mind when making this ball.  The ball has a wide channel design. suitable for indoors or outdoors use. the ball meets official NBA size and weight requirements.  Can really speak on the durablilty but for the most part. we are really impressed with this ball.  Buy it. you'll love it!"
2,"A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells.  It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact.  It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine.  The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end.  I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it."
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
9,"I bought this only for the odometer function. I just wanted to know how far I was riding each day . I usually ride only two different routes that cannot be verified by driving my car over the same route. ( dedicated bike trails ). It is really not a bad unit for the price. I don't need something that will last for years. Once I know the distance of the routes I could just un-install it if I wanted to.. Ordered on a Wedesday A.M. and it arrived on Thurdsay P.M..It took about 10 minutes to install and off I went. Tested on a route @ Lake Perris Ca. and I was riding 12 miles( assumed it was 10 ) . So if you are looking to buy one. just do it. It is very inexpensive and will probably last a long time if you are careful with it .."
6,"This Swingline Lite Classic Cut is a standard size cutter but is light weight so you can move it around if needed. It's nice to cut coupons or whatever else you may be doing like craft projects. It is easy to move around and store if you have the room. Because it was called &#8220;lite&#8221;. I thought it would be a smaller size but it's just lighter in weight than others that I've used. It still takes up quite a bit of room.It has measurement markings and a grid on the the cutting board to help with measuring and lining up your cutting projects.There is a locking mechanism for the arm which is nice. I have another one that you can not lock the arm in place and I worry about the safety of that one.I noticed that is states it is for the occasional 10-sheet cutting project so I think this would be suited to homework. coupons. etc but may not stand up to daily use in an office or classroom."
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
6,"I remember learning. back in 1st or 2nd grade. how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop. That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis. Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk. hand a couple of light pictures. and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light. inexpensive. durable and is handy to have around."
6,"I ship a lot of books and packages in re-used envelopes and packaging. In the past. I've always had to use an additional piece of paper. or a dark marker. to cover up the old address. That's not the case with Avery's shipping labels with TrueBlock technology.These amazing labels effectively cover up any existing label or writing. making it impossible to see the previous address. It might sound like a small feature. but for this shipper it's a time-saver.And. since they're the dependable Avery brand. I can simply enter the package number into my printing program and know that it will print the labels without fail. You can't go wrong."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
4,"This movie sets a new standard for subsequent Jesus films. I must confess that I was disposed to 'like' the film no matter what. but having seen it. I find it truly remarkable. It was not entertaining... It is a film for reflection. Gibson captures perfectly the sentiment that the 'Christ should suffer and die' (the Gospel according to Luke). And for who? All of us. One cannot expect to appreciate this movie if all one wants is a good flick. This film challenges Christians and non-Christians alike to reflect on the sufferings of Christ.As an aside. I would not take small children to this film (in fact. the crucifixion scenes in most films are too much for small children). And I would recommend that viewers read one of the gospels. if not all of the gospels. before viewing it. As it covers the last 12 hours of Christ's life. much can be gained from a close reading of the biblical texts."
8,"We have a standard poodle with a ball fetish. She loves (and this is not a strong enough word) tennis balls or anything that can be thrown and returned. We have a large backyard but when I throw the tennis ball (without the Chuckit). she just looks at me with an exasperated. 'Really?' The Chuckit allows me to throw the ball clear across our (did I mention large?) yard. I can throw it for a long time without ever getting a sore shoulder or arm and the BEST PART is that I never have to touch a slobbery. muddy ball. Picking the ball up with the Chuckit is very easy. as long as the dog isn't attacking the ball while I'm trying to get it off the ground.This is a highly recommended product. We've had three (ours stay outside and get chewed on and bent by the kids at some point). And I will continue to buy them as others wear out."
12,"This Game is Awsome...purely...AWSOME!!!! I has an OK 1 player made but... the multiplayer is just outstanding!! This is a great party game... You just can't stop playing. Personally. DK. Fox. Kirby are my Favorites...btw...if you set the damage in multiplayer to 200%. then hit players 1-3 times using DK's ^+B spcieal move. your opponent will FLY!!! AND I MEAN FLY!!! ;) My Friends hate this move!!! :) Also Fox's \/+B Special move. you can reflect all moves and attacks!!! and Kirby can suck players abilities and fall on them with his \/+B special move like a brick!!! You have to buy this game!! It is the best ever!!"
12,"Right off the bat. before it came out. you'd probably wonder how would you ever imagine Mario in 3D. Well. here's your answer: Mario 64.There's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each (Counting 100 coin stars). with stars for rewards. Those stars help you unlock more levels.At the time. no one ever saw anything like this before. Although the graphics look fairly primitive now. they were still eye candy for most Mario fans. especially back then.Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like: With a free camera. flawless control. and extremely playable environments.Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge. (SPOILER ALERT) If you do manage to get them all. you get to visit Yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you 100 lives along with an improved triple jump move.Overall. you know what I want you to do. so do it. Buy the game"
10,"I've had this Plate Joiner for about 5 years. When I first got it. I thought it was great. It made slots that I could put biscuits in and join stuff. However. the first time I used it to make a critical joint. the major shortcoming showed up. The slots are not parallel to the base. They are a little more parallel when using the fence. but I prefer using the base indexing method.Also. as many other reviewers have noted. the chip ejection chute gets clogged very easily. making it difficult to work cleanly."
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
9,"This is a great hockey net for the kids to use on the street or driveway. It's very sturdy and still light enough for my 8 year old to carry it around easily. The netting. the posts. and the sticks are all great quality for this price. This has a lot of bang for the buck. I liked it so much. I thought I was ordering two more (to keep at the in-laws) but instead I accidentally ordered  Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White which has these flimsy little posts and I know it'll end up broken in no time. At least I have one solid net to rely on and two crappy ones as spares. I HIGHLY recommend getting this one over the Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White!!"
6,"This product works as advertised. Avery has been in the label business a long time. and knows how to specialize. They make affordable labels. The most difficult part for me in using labels made for a printer is setting up the program that has the addresses on them. Word makes this a little easier. Once this is accomplished. the labels can be put in the printer. printer settings changed to accept them. and you have printed address labels. Much quicker than doing this by hand. and they look so much better!"
5,"Many reviews cover the pro's of this item. so I'll be short only to add that they are very sturdy (when install properly...suggestion:  find a wall stud and use 3' screws for heavier instruments).Used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strat's.  Haven't had an issue with any in the 4-5 months we've had them up.  On the electrics. we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable.The hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping.Wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
10,"This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm surprised Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws.  I was able to install it by myself. and I'm an old guy.  I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw. disconnected the bolt. and lowered it to the floor.  After that. the installation goes very easy and straightforward.  Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off. but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good.  Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw.  I recommend this accessory."
8,"Not the &#34;Ohhhhhh noooooooo!&#34; again! This toy gets to be very annoying because that's all it says but it's fun to see the look on the dog's face when Mr. Bill says it. This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog doesn't use the soft mouth. The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone. It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to. you just sew it back up. It's a fun toy but easy to break. This was the 3rd toy I've bought for the dog. She likes the &#34;Ohhhh noooo!!!&#34;"
3,"Deidre Nelson is back in Ventura Texas watching over her parent's bedand breakfast while they are away. Jonas Mendez is the town's sheriff.The last time Deidre and Jonas saw each other was to say goodbyebefore Deidre left for New York ten years ago.Ten years is a long time. but the attraction that simmered betweenDeidre and Jonas is as strong as ever and the anticipation of whatmight become of it is even stronger!Anticipation is the perfect title for Jonas and Deidre's story.  Ilove how they got back what they once had. Of course this time. it'sbetter than before!  There is a lot of heat and heart in Anticipation;it's a sexy and very romantic story.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
9,"Out of the box you will be impressed with this great multitool! Beautifully polished. individual locking tools that don't clump when you open them. That pliers are not needle nose but I like the compromise. The stout but slightly rounded nose is precise enough for most precision jobs but because the metal is of softer material I can understand why they don't included it. The craftsmanship on this tool is top notch and better than any other multitool I ever had. What more can I say. it's a victorinox!"
5,"I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them."
9,"This is the only soap I use (with occasional excursions into pine tar soap. for specific uses... See my reviews on pine tar soap)I love the peppermint especially for the tingle and zing you get from using it!I use it as bodywash. shampoo. and to do dishes with.I've never experienced the drying effects when others complain of when using it on my hair either.Don't know if it's due to others not using it right or freak body chemistry on my part. Either way. I am a proud Dr. Bronners user!"
12,"In my opinion. this is the greatest Playstation game ever released. The storyline is intense. and profusely in-depth and really grasps you into the storyline. which revolves around many characters instead of one. The music is beautiful and many times envokes emotions during parts of the game. this game . in my opinion. has the greatest musical score. I have noticed people complain about this games graphics. well if you have a problem with graphics in an RPG...then I have to say. your intellectual level is very low. First of all. this game's graphics are fine.even compared to the graphics of more recent video game titles...and the game does Not revolve around its graphics.There are many other factors that seperate this game from other RPGs. This game also has the best story in a video game title to date. and there are situations that occur during the game that add to the story perfectly. If you want a solid. and deep RPG. this is for you."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
8,"This product isn't quite as high quality as it looks in the picture above. and I'd highly recommend you take a close look at its dimensions before purchasing it (if this is a 'medium.' I can't imagine how tiny the 'small' must be).  I'd also only recommend this item for supervised play (not. as I'd hoped. as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy's crate overnight).  The body of the toy is only the length of my index finger. and I'm concerned that any larger breed puppy will rip this thing to shreds in minutes if you let him.  Oh well."
5,"These little patch cables work nicely. there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches. right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches. right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches. whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude. would I recommend these? Yes. if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable. go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else."
8,"My cats loved this. They had energy. their coats looked shiny and had less dander. Compared to Blue Buffalo. this is better and less expensive. But it is still quite pricey so I switched to Purina Friskies which is garbage. because I had to save some money this month. I did some research and the Purina One formula looks pretty good. I would say it is between the Friskies and the Beyond. The first ingredient is real meat. I looked up what 'corn gluten meal' is in the regular Purina One (not Beyond) it is a decent/inexpensive source of protein. It isn't actual gluten at all. it is the second ingredient on the list. I am going to try the Purina One next. And if there are coupons for this one I will get this one. It is really good. I would recommend. especially over Blue Buffalo and Wellness. in my humble opinion."
6,"Avery is a brand that has been doing laser labels for as long as I can remember and they put out a very nice product.  This particular size. the 5260 is the perfect size for address labels for envelopes.  Three columns. ten long means you get 30 labels to a sheet.Easy peel off. easy printing with no jams.  The perfect label.The nice thing about Avery is that it works seamlessly with Microsoft Office.  In word they have templates for all the Avery laser labels and you just have to select which one you are using and the blank template just pops up.  Sometimes with generic brands. this is not the case and you have to manually set your parameters which while doable for a regular MS Word user could prove to be quite an obstacle for the casual user.I highly recommend these labels to anyone.  They will not give you trouble."
3,"What I Loved: Scott was such a delicious guy to read!  He was just the right amount of alpha vs vulnerable.  He was also YUMMY!  The fact that he was blind kind of made him that much more lovable.  Tara and Scott had a great chemistry that was fun to read.Complaint: The ending was way to abrupt!  It felt like a whole chapter was left out of the bookWhat makes this good Holiday read:  If you are looking for a short but naughty holiday read this may work for you.  It was about getting out of a bad situation into a good situation.  Just keep in mind the rather abrupt ending."
3,"I enjoyed the book and the characters I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because I too feel that the author could have backed off a little with all the erotica. The story line is a good one but needs to be developed more. Some reviews were complaining about the link between rider. dragon and sex. If anyone who has read the' Dragonriders of Pern' series would know this has already been established in Dragon fantasy lore. However where as the Pern series down plays the sexual side of the relationships Maiden Flight is in your face erotica. I do agree there needs to be a warning that this is an ADULT dragon fantasy novel  and not for young adults.  The series has great promise and I'm hoping that the next book goes more into the story line with a little sex thrown it ;)"
4,"The late Robert Ginty. R.I.P.. lays down some rough road in this one. though the guy on the cover aint him! This is a NY picture. like Street Trash. Ms. .45. The Wanderers. The Warriors. The Lords Of Flatbush. The taking Of Pelham 1.2.3. (the original 70s version with Walter Matthau. Robert Shaw. and Simon Oakland. not the unneccessary '00s remake!). et al. And like all good made-in-New York movies. you know eventually somebody's gonna be handed their ass!! This is no exception. Be prepared to suffer. You have been warned! The sickness with the quickness!!"
10,"1/8/10 Have been using this drill and am very pleased.  It has tons of torque and the handle comes in handy.  Just great to have a corded drill with this type of power for when the cordless 18V wont do the job or if you have a lot of screws to driveHavent used this drill yet but am looking forward to putting it to work.  I bought it because I only had cordless drills. aside from a great. rugged Milwaukee Hammer drill. was also confident because of great reviews from others. It is very solid and I like the quick change cord.  I expect to have this drill for years"
3,"This is the first book I've read by Ally Blue and it won't be the last. I enjoyed this story immensely even if it was on the light side. There was little to no background or buildup. but somehow it worked as a short story about two very sweet people. I like the heroes this author created. they were good and kind people. even though there were some fights and arguments. they worked things out. I was not a fan of the whole developer and corrupt city officials part of the story but luckily for me. that was only a brief part of the whole story. I enjoyed this very much and would recommend it to others as a hot. romantic MM read."
9,"I bought the blue/heavy resistance band to use in two of my tube workouts. The band I had no longer provided enough resistance and it was time to upgrade.Two things to point out. The handles are not padded. Not a big deal.Secondly. this tube is about 6 inches shorter than what I was previously using. The measurements are in the description. I thought the bands were a standard length so I didn't pay attention to the length. In order to use this band in my workouts. I need to reposition my body/grip/whatever during some of the exercises due to the shorter length.The band is still a nice upgrade from what previously used. Just look at measurements if the band is going to be used as a replacement band."
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
10,"The main flaw with this light would have been trivial in the recent past. Compared to other ways of providing light. even DeWalt ways. this is not an effective solution.I bought this to have a working light that also used the 18v power packs from my various DeWalt 18v tools. So far so good. But it really burns some power. it gets quite warm and the light doesn't last as long and isn't as bright as you would hope.I also have the DeWalt DC527 fluorescent light. it provides a much better working light. lasts longer and is easier to use to get light on your work. By comparison to the DC527 this is an uneven and yellowish light.This is more compact than the DC527 though. and it provides better range. fluorescent provides more white light. but only at limited range."
5,"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard. which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound. drums. congas. tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech. the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best."
10,"Almost bought the variable speed but less powerful cousin.  Glad I didn't.  This unit works great.  It's heavy so you won't want to do much vertical or overhead work.  One reviewr commented that it wears out his workers and I can see why.  An hour is the must I can go without a break. But you can get a lot of sanding done in an hr with this tool.Much quieter than my old Sears unit.  Dust collector works surprisingly well (but I wish they offered a vac attachment becasue at the rate this unit removes material you will have to empty bag every 10 min or sooner.Probably 3 times faster than my 3' Sears and more stable with 4' footprint.My past tools have been Bosch. Milwaukee. and Dewalt.  But I bought Makita's top of line 18V saw and drill and was very impressed.  Bought this based on that experience and great reviews.  Very satisfied."
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
10,"I bought this saw at a woodworking show a couple years ago and have been thrilled with its performance ever since.  I previously owned an inexpensive Black and Decker which had poor balance. a top handle. and tended to vibrate terribly.  I have also used DeWalt and Milwaukee jigsaws. and I still maintain that Bosch is the best.  I happen to prefer the barrel grip.  With this saw I can make super smooth. nearly tear-out free cuts in almost any material as long as I use the proper blade and blade speed.  The sheer lack of vibration alone makes this saw worth its weight in gold when you are trying to make an intricate cut in thin material!!!  I highly recommend this product."
6,"The 3m Copy Holder is useful in a variety of ways. It's good for the student who needs to type up his or her notes from classes. Or the office worker who needs a place to hold papers. The copy holder is 18' wide and is sturdy enough to hold up to 300 sheets of thick paper. catalogs. books. and more. The copy hold fits perfectly on most desks or tables and is designed to be positioned directly between your computer monitor and keyboard. however it will easily fit anywhere. It also has an elastic cord that stretches across to hold your documents in place.  Overall this a very handy office tool and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs it."
2,"Purchased the 3670G via Amazon. Just arrived and immediately plugged it into my Kill-A-Watt. The device shows amperage draw on anything plugged into it and it shows the Mite is only drawing 10amps.Either I received the 10amp model that other reviewers have posted about (old reviews though... two year old reviews) or the mfg is lying about it's capabilities.Having said all that. it's a nice. simple. lightweight machine that really sucks (in a good way). but I can't help but wonder how much better it would perform if it was truly the 12amp model.If any other reviewers have any advice. please post a comment."
9,"The Seal Pup is a great knife to have alongside your pistol. This rode next to my M9 on a Blackhawk Serpa and Omega holster. Held its edge. the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy. The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap. Chunks got torn out of it. The blade finish also wears off. I ended up engraving mine a bit so it didn't look like everyone else's knife. Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally. I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one. Great buy and if you don't have a need for an M9 bayonet. this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments."
12,"I believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because. the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games. Seek out enemy. kill and move to the next level. and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles. so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters. locations. car. weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however. the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning. If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one. I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all. And this one I really do like very much."
3,"I do agree that I would like to have spent more time with these characters. I was very bummed when it just ended. and i do agree it could have used more depth. But I really loved these characters. For what they were. in the length given. they popped. Book reads very much like a brilliant fantasy. Like all her stories so far. the story has a sweet quality to it. but very hot. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was and look forward to more from this author."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
3,"The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling."
4,"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character. although well known by most. is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale."
9,"I was bored and trolling Amazon and saw this...it looked like fun so I ordered it. I read the assembly directions. which said you need 3 people. but a woman said in her review that she assembled her trampoline alone...props to her cause I tried and nothing...absolutely no movement whatsoever. I took it to work and 3 guys assembled it very easily. but used their combined strength to make the pieces go together and open. The smell is obnoxious. which I hope will dissipate over time. All in all a fun purchase."
4,"This film was a bad film based soley on entertainment value.  I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved.  If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality.  this film may have more substance.  Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve.  I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value.  Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining.  Nor does this film have ANY artistic value.  The dialect isn't presented well here either.  The Aramaic voice isn't given justice here.  given the horridly poor interpretation and it's presentation.  This film is trash.  Simply.  God bless."
12,"What can I possibly say about this game that hasn't been said a million times.Perfection.Groundbreaking.Beautiful.Just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Zelda 64.Zelda was my introduction to RPG's and what an introduction it was.The good.Everything.Graphics. story. pacing. etc...Insanely difficult in parts. I still can't beat the water temple without the walk through.And Ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time.The bad?Nothing.One of the games that not only defined the N64 but a game that set the standard for excellence in RPG's.One of the best...ever.Highest recommendations."
7,"It is nicely constructed. It is made of metal. so it will hold up. The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food. You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area. You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds. It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food. If you twist the Weathervane. it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling. It also comes with an attachment (including fasteners) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand. easy to place and remove from stand. Over all this is a nice feeder."
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
2,"OXO Soft-Handled Can Opener. Item # 28081. This is a hard-to-clean kitchen tool. Not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles. Also. the soft handles are not sealed onto the body of the can opener. so dishwater accumulates in them. and therefore so do rotting food particles. mold... you get the point. It is possible to pull off the handles and wash all the surfaces. but what a pain! And then. the handles wear and loosen so they start to slide when opening cans. After three months. I replaced the Oxo Good Grips Can Opener with aZyliss Lock-n-Lift Can Openerwhich. after six months. still works very well."
4,"I loved it-I had seen this movie many years ago and loved it then&#62; I love Richard Burton-He's so deep in this movie-very young and very deep. What a brillant actor he is and became.I gave it five stars because the quality of him overall deserved it.Olvia De Havilland-wow what a brillant star she is. Between the two of them-wow! how different they are-but this movie brought a side we never saw before.Thank you -for the opportunity to share my views."
7,"There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around.  I set them up to water out in the fields around us.  They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose.  As I am driving around my area; I see that I am not the only one who uses them.  They are sturdy. don't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality.  Unlike some other tripods. the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed.  They will fall over if you have a decent windy day.  So. you should check on them occasionally."
5,"I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar. so after some research online and talking to friends. I bought this capo.It goes on easily.comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside. seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!"
3,"Overall. I was absorbed in this story and the semi-abrupt ending has really left me for wanting more.  Don't get me wrong on the ending though.  It was abrupt only in the fact that I wanted to know more and there wasn't any.  I've already checked out Kaye's site and the only other novel listed is Angelic Avenger. which I don't believe is in this series.  I'm 99.9% sure of that one.  So. I'm going to be hoping there's more to this story in the future because I really want to know.  Definitely a great read for anyone looking for something new.For my full review. check out Literary Escapism."
8,"We've been giving our dog this medicine for years and its always done a good job of keeping the ticks and other things off of him.  We have found a few dead ticks in his fur. but never a live one and certainly not one head deep into his blood supply.  Applying it isn't so difficult but since our dog is white. it does leave a discoloration in his fur until his next bath.  This is what our vet recommended so we're going with it and it works fine."
12,"I always hated the WCW. I was playing Warzone. Attitude and WWF titles for a long time. Then I somehow ended up owning this game and I inteneded to dissmiss it. but I found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it. I was happy to hear THQ got the rights to WWF and went from this to Wrestlmania and then the best game on the 64 NO MERCY. However. this is the foundation of where it started and I respect it for that. It brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights. I recomend No Mercy over this. but this original version deserves your respect."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
2,"I just received this yesterday. and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.  I was a little apprehensive. since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet. operated smoothly. and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine. but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also. due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker. we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
4,"I found the first half of the film to be very interesting and well done. Fine acting and production values.  Then it turned into an S&M porno movie.  The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene.  It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
9,"I put this on my Ruger Mark III Target and I am very happy. The multiple reticles would be more fun with larger targets. but at 50 yards. you only need the 3 MOA dot. Easy zeroing and not as heavy as expected. but then again. a Mark III Target is a beast of a .22 pistol. Don't buy the cheesy $20 red dot. Save your dough and buy this quality product. Aimpoints are GREAT. but over rated. If you don't mind the added weight. then this is a better buy."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
2,"I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.  In truth. I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end. it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan. so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall. so while the handle on top makes it portable. and it's built to stand on the floor. it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
7,"I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix. watered. then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall (or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers).Echinacea. red lettuce. romaine lettuce. snap peas. orange sunflower. red sunflower. chives. 4 different heirloom tomatoes. and dill - all of them are growing like weeds.  As soon as they're big enough for transplanting. I'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago. since you can keep the dome mostly shut (or open it up if that's too wet).My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge.  But. that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed doesn't fix.  For the price. I really couldn't be happier!"
8,"This quality spray did exactly as advertised. I have a cat. who likes to go outside his litter box. and an active toddler who loves to drop food and color on our light-colored carpet.  I used this Bissell Pet Stain and Odor spray as directed. generously spraying a stained area. blotting and covering with a wet rag. and leaving it alone for several hours.  I am pleased to say that even some long-time stains that I grown to live with are starting to fade considerably or disappear entirely.As another reviewer pointed out. this product does not work on ink. My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen. and this spray was not very effective on that area. However. as promised. it did eliminate virtually all of my cat stains throughout the house. I have no complaints and would easily recommend this to others."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
7,"I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota. where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover. but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me. this is a minor drawback. but others might find it more objectionable."
2,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant. so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed. but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades. two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit."
10,"talk about getting down to business.  this saw chews up wood.nails.pipe. whatever gets in the way.  it definately outcuts the milwaukee.  i like the weight of this tool. it makes those overhead cuts alot easier. just rest the saw on top and let it chew its way through.i deducted a star for two reasons: 1: there is more vibration than the milwaukee(what else do you compare a saws all to).2: the quick change chuck is a little difficult at times.  it likes to bind up and you will need a plier to twist it free.  not a real tight bind. just too much for fingers.overall. if mine was lost. stolen. or broken. i would not hesitate to purchase the P-C again"
7,"It's a classic all right. but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well. you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag. far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing. however. is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut."
4,"I would have liked to seen more to this movie other than just the beating. I also hate subtitles. I don't care if they were trying to make it accurate to the dialect. I don't like to go to a movie to pay to read. to me it defeats the purpose: i could read a book. Had lots of gore. for that I gave it an extra star. For the repetitive scenes over and over again. I subtracted several stars. You know what kills me. Conservatives and religious people bash violence in movies and video games. but it seems as if it is ok to put this stuff in as long as your talking about Christ. Hypocrisy = religion do as I say not as I do. right? and stay away from those alter boys!"
4,"I really didn't like the way Jesus is portrayed in this film because it shows Him more as being a human being who plays practical jokes on His Apostles and goofing off during His sermons than being the Son of God who came on earth to save us. Call me old fashioned. but I like the traditional way of portraying the life of Jesus in film. which shows Him as being compassionate. loving. and bold in doing His mission. and yes with a sense of humor. but at the same time taking serious things seriously. I have to say that I liked the Jesus of Nazareth film and 'The Passion' by Mel Gibson. much better."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
10,"PC 97366 has so much vibrations that I had to give it gift to my enemy..  Horrible...  then within a week . I got a Xmas Gift of Home Depot Card and I used it to buy Rigit Sander from Home Depot for $139...  ( I SAID . I CAN RETURN IT IF I DON'T LIKE IT )WHAT A SURPIRISE THEN...  THE RIGID IS SUPREME SANDER WITH ZERO PAIN IN HAND AND AWESOME GERMAN BUILT ...  GREAT BUILD QUALITY AND 3 YEAR WARRANTY...  YOU CAN'T MISS THAT...I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD RIGID SANDERS ARE...  BYE PORTER CABLE..."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
8,"Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer.  She sniffed it and walked away.  I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else.  I don't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old. also a big chewer. hasn't touched it either.  I'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me."
8,"We have two lab mixes. The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew. but he was going through too many rawhides. I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section. The first plain bone went over well. So I ordered more on Amazon. I'm so glad I did! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have! Thank goodness for nylabones!"
5,"I've been a gigging musician for almost 20 years. and this is the most well made. most comfortable guitar/bass strap I've ever used.Pros:- Substantial padding where you need it- Perfect stitching- Heavy. stiff leather ends- Soft. fine-woven material - not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps- Underside is lined with an even softer material - makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on- Did I mention it's super comfortable?Cons:- None to speak of.  Seriously.  It's that phenomenal.Perfect whether you're rocking a featherweight Strat or a 16-pound 6-string bass.I use it with a 13-pound 5-string Warwick bass. and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me.  I hardly notice I'm actually wearing it.Combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks. and it could easily last you 10 years.You will not be sorry with this purchase."
12,"I won't lie this game was really cool back in the day and i play it with utter pleasure.(at that time) it was only my second 64 game i ever borrowed. sure the graphics was stink and at times the game play frustrating the heck out of me. however this isn't one i'll call a classic it's no Zelda. Perfect Dark . Donkey Kong 64 and i can go on and on. if you don't believe me try to play this game now!!!! you will find yourself saying yuk! yuk! yuk! 'n' i am being nice. it's worth a try but most likely true gamers will find it bogus. it has not true replay value and all in all it had it's time and that's all it will ever have. in my opinion. for those who loved it i am no psychologist so i can't say whats your problem is but!!! maybe you need to play real good game laterzzzzz folks / gamers."
12,"In its tenure. the N64 had its share of bad games. With exceptions like Super Mario 64. the THQ wrestling games and a few others. it seemed like the bad outweighed the good. But with 'Ocarina of Time'. the balance took a drastic shift as n64 was given its best overall game.'Ocarina of TIme' has many strong points for itself. For one. the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake. The game plays across a vast world with different subsections. each with their own particular themes. The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game. Graphics and sounds are done extremely well. considering the cartridge space allowed.There is not much to complain about. as this game really showed players what the N64 was capable of. It's unfortunate that other game publishers didn't work this hard. But then again. &quot;Ocarina&quot; is a tough act to follow."
4,"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph. the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.Joseph is the favored son of his father. a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery. he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor. and Joseph's steadfastness. he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him. seeking help. they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first. it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well."
5,"The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price. It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young (smaller) player or a.nice travel instrument."
2,"My son works at a ice cream shop. and when I recieved this ice cream scoop. he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work. Until he actually used it. It looks metal. but feels like it's plastic. When I used it for the first time. I was scooping out very hard ice cream. and it felt like it was going to break. I had to turn it in circles to get anything. I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one. At least I know it won't break in my hand."
5,"this is my first petal of  any kind.  I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that.  glad I did.  this Wah petal is so much fun.  you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow.  It is hours and hours of fun.  the sounds are great.  I have had no problem with performance.  it works as it should.  I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well."
8,"I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years.  NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid.  This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years. but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off.  The cord finally snapped on Monday.  Not only the short lifespan considering the price. but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan.  No matter what litter brand I tried. it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan. would stick to the rake. and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws. which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea. very poor longterm performance."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
5,"Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too. but it is very flammable. I would call it average."
2,"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up. my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine. but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal. and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item."
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
7,"This is a nice. versatile pot holder for any sort of railing.  We live in a townhouse. and each unit has a fenced-in. concrete patio.  There's really no place to plant flowers. so a container garden is an only option.  I didn't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio. so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed.  It's 10 inches at the top. and will accommodate a range of flower pots.  The fastener is adjustable. to make them useful in a wide variety of locations.  I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly.  It's sturdy and well-made. and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
9,"Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However. on my two lever-action rifles. it's not very effective -- probably no surprise. given the design. On an older Winchester 94. I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together. with some effort. On a Winchester 9422. it attaches itself to the trigger guard. and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded. cocked. and fired with the lock still in place."
12,"Sephiroth. the main villian of the game. is probably the best-dressed villian in a FF game.  Also. he has the most sinister theme of any villian in any game.  Everything about Sephiroth is sinister.You play Cloud. a man from the small city of Nibelheim (sounds like a city in Germany). Cloud works for AVALANCHE. a terrorist group that's fighting against the evil Shirna. Inc.  As the game unfolds. you learn that Shirna. Inc does far more evil than AVALANCHE does.  Shirna. Inc knows no end to its evil.One of the best games for the ps1!"
10,"I bought this unit some time ago and finally got to use it remodeling our basement. I have a 12inch compound sliding miter saw in my garage but the thought of lugging that thing down stairs to cut base moulding didnt float my boat. Then. I remembered my Bosch 1640SVK. Yes. it has limitations but none that was a deal breaker. I placed a 3/4 sheet of 24x96 plywood on a couple of saw horses and I was trimming and nailing like a Pro. No clouds of saw dust. no dust vacuum running although SVK does have a 2.25 port. I can sight exactly where I want the narrow kerf and it does the job.I will have this fine tool outside when I re-do the screens on our three season porch.Thanks Again Bosch!!!"
7,"I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons. but with the help of another person and two long poles. we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away. it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled. before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing. what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit. but I don't want to kill songbirds. certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away. not kill them."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
12,"the one that started it all i have it and you should to i will in detail say the pros and cons of the game.the pros are great story. great puzzles. the suspense is great as well as the monsters that are in it over all it draws you in the world of the resident evil.the cons to much back and forth in the game. bazooka wont blow open doors. the other issue is if played on the ps2 you have to get used to the original controls again im used to ps2 games now guess im spoiled lol where you use the analog sticks to move and look around.over all great game turn out the lights put it in and put yourself in the game and have fun."
4,"Holy cow!!!  I was completely drenched with sweat at the end of this workout.  I have a few of Kathy's videos and have always been pleased with her technique.  She doesn't disappoint here.  I have all of Billy Blanks  Tae-bo tapes and this so much better.  A very thourough warm-up leads into  a tremendous workout that keeps your pulse elevated and ends with a great  toning section for the legs utilizing the kicks you've just learned.  A  bonus ab work rounds out a perfect tape.  Also feautured is trainer Kelli  Roberts. from Cher's first video and the star of her own two excellent step  video.  Hope someone signs Kelli up for her own kickboxing tape!"
5,"This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank. which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals. decent quality. and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!"
12,"This is the best shoot em up on the N64. I was very impressed with the game play. the graphics. the action. the multi player fun. everything.... the only downfall about the game is I wanted more. more. more. The cheats are great when you unlock them and the best thing is you dont need a memory card. everything saves on the cartridge. RARE actualy managed to compress a game that was too big for the N64 into this game somehow. and it suprises me that it does not even use the N64 Expansion pack to do that!!! This game is not just hoursand hours of fun. but days. weeks. years . i still play this cool game even today!"
7,"It is flexible. can hold 50+ pounds (lbs). and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt. as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force. which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts. one of which can easily handle.  However. the overall look is less than inspiring."
5,"I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on. so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose. and notably. I chose it for the color. just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far. it's given me no problems. and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain. too. since it's certainly not an expensive accessory."
4,"Besides the religious backdrop. the main crux of this movie is to depict as much realism and authenticity as possible about the corporeal punishment during the Roman times. From the religious view point. the movie wants you to feel visually what your Lord has gone through.If you think that the 39 lashes were just mere whips. you are quite misinformed. Read Josh McDowell's book on Crucifixion and  you will get the written version about the instruments used during Jesus' time. Again. the crucifixion itself was shown under full light with no turning away of the camera.In my opinion. the movie has achieved. in stellar proportions. what it had set out to do. The additional depiction of Mary's love for her Son was well constructed. although not documented the way the movie has shown. All in all. the theatrical effects are moving and they are a good reminders for believers.Good work. Mel!"
5,"Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings.  I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way.However. I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine.  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate.  Therefore. strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds.  I also love the d'Addario make.  Which I purchase through Amazon...always."
10,"I purchased this attachment a couple months ago. and it has proven to be a real surprise.  Since it is an inexpensive tool. with the more inexpensive chisels and bits included. I didn't expect it to be a precision tool. but  it really does well.  I have now used it to make mortises in red oak. white  pine. and southern yellow pine. and am glad that I didn't spend more money  than I did.  The other reviewers are absolutely correct that set-up is time  consuming. but for a hobbyist woodworker like me. it does the job  efficiently. cheaply. and well.  I would definitely purchase this item  again."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
5,"Got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me. my guitar. and my sound.I'm a 62 YO newby to guitar!! This proves that easy helps. I have a big baby Taylor and when i needed new strings I went to the wrong place. got Martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me.  Sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. My friend said that he uses D'Addario and that they make ALL the difference in the world!! Tried them and he was right.  I changed my own (on the big Baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the E and B string like the dealer did!) MY Taylor recommends Elixr. but the D'Addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!!"
12,"This game I grew up with and enjoy very much. I have been playing this game since I was 6 or 7 years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new. What I have is a like new version but unforutantely I lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe I will find it one day while I shop around the internet. I love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the like."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
5,"Price:Very reasonable price for what they do.Comfort:These stay on your head very well and are comfortable. I have not noticed ear irritation yet.Noise reduction:These are absolutely stellar at noise reduction. These block so much sound. you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums. They also don't distort out side sound. Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly.Sound quality:Crisp mid and high range. When it comes to the low end. these are lacking. And if you blast your music the low end distorts. But they block sound so well you don't have to blast them.Why not just buy in ear head phones. and over ear muffs?I have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones. It is very annoying. doesn't work very well. and looks pretty dumb too. These head phones are a much better solution."
10,"I must own about 20 DeWALT tools and this is a frustrating tool.  For the most part I really like DeWALT tools but this one needs to be redesigned.  The blade will not track straight.  The problem seems to be in the blade mounting system.  I have never had a problem with the blade coming loose. however as you screw the cap to tighten the blade you can see the plunger start to turn as you crank down on this thing.  Since you tighten to the right. the blade will end up pointed to the right.  Now I have found that if you back off slightly you can line it up. but that's not the way a jig saw should work.  I think that in this case you would be better served with a Bosch."
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
8,"I am really liking this product after all.  I was not sure it would stay warm for long. but it really does.  I have not determined how long yet. but hours more than anything I have ever used.  I put it outside under a blanket in a small house to keep a cat warm. and I think tonight was the first she was on it!  Even if the cat does not like it in the end (I had an electric warmer before and she was afraid and would not go in the house) I am keeping it to warm my bed before I get under the covers!"
5,"Holy guacamole. you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase. then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too."
9,"This is a compact. handy. well made tool.  I debated giving it 4 stars because the handle material seems thin and perhaps a bit fragile. but. so far it holds up great and takes up very little space. all things considered. I also have a few Smith's diamond sharpeners and the DMT beats them all.  The folding design protects the surface when closed and provides a handle when open.  Tip: when using this as a typical bench whetstone. lean the far end of the sharpener on the table top.  Only add water or use it dry - anything else will gum it up.  Although this angles the stone. it steadies it. making for solid grining angle and surface.  I've sharpened a collection of knives and even got a really good edge on some scissors I was debating tossing - fist time sharpening scissors.  Look out edged tools!This is one of those tools I'd buy again to have a back-up.  MADE IN USA."
3,"I have read a few of Karen Erickson's books previously and overall she's a pretty good writer. I enjoyed this book. but it wasn't something I was thinking about much after finishing it. Not a huge amount of depth to the heroine. I had some trouble relating to her with her need for useless spending. but she did have great chemistry with the hero and I liked that there wasn't a huge 'end of the relationship' moment like many romances. rather the characters progressed in their relationship without tons of drama. Overall a good read and I would read this author again. the rest of the series would be worth checking out also."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
8,"Our lab carries around sticks. rocks. you name it wherever she goes. This particular style of Nylabone is exceptional because of the design.  There are two ridges that fit their incisors perfectly so they can carry it around without worrying it will slip out and break my foot if she drops it!~ Also. even though not flavored. she likes to work on it slowly. which means for the money it will last a long time.  We've spent a lot on the other types of designs and she liked them but they were either to destructible or too heavy for her to walk around with for any amount of time.  For whatever reason. it seems to calm her to carry a bone around and this is the best designed. tough and perfect size for a large dog. She says THANK YOU:)"
10,"I earn an income visiting construction sites.  More rough carpenters use this circular saw then any other (including the Skil HD77M).In March of this year. I bought the HD77 used ...to replace a low-end Black & Decker which was purchased new for $50 in 1981.For DIY projects around the house. the heavy-duty. smooth operating HD77 has yet to disappoint.  Initially. I had to get used to the weight and the ergonomics.  The cuts were smooth with no irritating startup kickback.  Plywood and sonotubes; no problem.With the increasingly harsh Toronto area winters. the oil in the HD77 requires to be room temperature warm prior to using the saw in the great outdoors of ours.With proper maintenance and care. this saw will be a vital and permanent tool for rough carpentry."
4,"Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen. Pretty much that is what this movie is. 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured. Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line. this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here. nope just two hours of beatings and torture."
10,"Ordered the 120 to check it out first. since I have never used Mirka before. I'm also confused on so many positive reviews. I found the discs cut really well and smooth out of the gate. but do not last long at all. Freud lasts longer for me. just hate the universal hole pattern they have. I'm pretty much using one disc per rail and stile of a cabinet door. That's not much life. Maybe it holds up better with a heavier grit prior to 120? My planer leaves wood fairly smooth. I'm used to going 120 from the planer. on up in grits. Oh well. On the search again."
2,"They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep. that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less. takes up less room in my cupboard. and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!"
3,"I love romances that are 'real' and this one is so very real. The characters are not larger than life. they have pasts. things they regret and dreams they have forgotten. They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other. their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book. it was beautiful. sweet. sad in places and oh ever touching. watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life."
3,"Rating 4 1/2 starsI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated in any way.Brett Andrews has an apartment above his club.  And Lisa is waiting for him.  This is a great way to start off this story.  Leo is an old friend of Lisa&#8217;s that&#8217;s come to the club.  The ending will leave you wanting to read more about this trio and having more of the club experience.Kallysten feeds on her reader&#8217;s need for a sexy vampire &#8211; especially for those of us that are female.  She paints a great picture of what happens when new meets old.  There&#8217;s nothing dark or sinister about what this group has.  If you&#8217;ve never read this author before. why not try this series.  If you love sexy. erotic. vampire short stories you can&#8217;t go wrong by reading Kallysten.  She&#8217;s a great author that knows how to pack a lot in just a few pages.  She never disappoints her readers."
8,"I've tried some of the major competing brands in an effort to save a few bucks. but Frontline continues to provide the best results for fighting fleas (on my three beagles and two cats).Last year. Frontline helped eliminate a flea infestation on my cats. when used in conjunction with other flea control solutions throughout my house. This year. we adopted three beagle puppies that were covered with fleas when we got them. Used Frontline again. at the recommendation of our vet. and the fleas were wiped out before they had a chance to re-infest our home.Continuing to use Frontline now to maintain our &#34;flealessness&#34;. I don't think Frontline Plus is perfect (It's expensive and doesn't seem to always last a full month). but for my pets. it's the best available and none of them display any adverse reactions to it."
4,"A tape or DVD of this show should be owned by every family in America. The level of care and loving craftsmanship seen here is something we are likely never to see again in the production of a film or show for children.This is demonstrated most of all. of course. in the music.'Silver and Gold'. 'Holly Jolly Christmas'. 'We Are Santa's Elves'.'There's Always Tomorrow'. 'The Most Wonderful Day of the Year'(whose eyes can stay dry through that one?) - all original compositions with full orchestral and choral accompaniment for a single TV show!For generations now. 'it isn't Christmastime until 'Rudolph' comes on'. Even if the networks give up airing it. I know my family will be cueing up this video every year the calendar's page is turned to December - I hope your family will be too."
12,"Lunar silver star story complete is the best remake ever! Blows away the original in every possible aspect. from graphics to story.+ one of the best 2d graphics ever. everything is crisp and detailed with great anime sequence+ new soundtrack is great. the only song boat blow me away+one of the best cast of characters ever+ a great story reworked. a great improvment over the original+ no random battle+ the battle are pretty difficult ( specially the boss battle)+ voice acting is good+ new extras+ great package- the gamplay is on the simple side- again a little sidequestsnow. my classification of the first lunar versions.lunar silver star story complete (ps) 10/10 masterpiece !lunar silver star harmony (psp) 8/10 downgraded version of the playstation masterpiecelunar the silver star (sega cd) 7/10 good.. but very obsolete. overshadowed by silver star storylunar legend (gba) 0/10 pure garbage"
4,"I am not a 'religious' person. however. I felt it was important to see this movie.  If nothing else. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.After sitting through a very quiet showing. my wife and I got up and walked out without saying a word.  It took a while for the movie to sink in.  Nobody was talking as they left the theatre.It was a moving experience.  Graphic and disturbing.  Something I am glad that I sat through. but can't see adding this to my movie collection.More interesting than the movie itself. is the reaction of those who liked or disliked it.  Reading the reviews of this movie is a great way to see the cultural divide in our country."
12,"This pretty good. it has a good story. great in-game movies and adequate gameplay. However most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to Red Alert. This is simply not true. The two games have  almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game. In saying this  I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay  from Red Alert. Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring  helicopters and cheap &quot;hover units&quot;.However this game is  not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics.  featuring performances by several Hollywood stars (well maybe not stars but  close enough). The graphics are pretty good but other games have done  better.Sure it's a classic and if you really like the series go  ahead and buy it. But if you want the true best strategy game of 1999. go  and check out Homeworld it's a far better game."
9,"It is an OK lantern that provides light at night. I did not try it out using unleaded gasoline. so I am going to assume it works OK using it (We used Coleman Fuel for it.) It is not too heavy to carry around. although it is way too heavy to hang on their very own Coleman Packaway Deluxe Camp Kitchen as the pole sways way too much. It was easy to setup and the included mantles worked great.The big issue on the one I received was that the adjustment knob was too sensitive to adjust the intensity to anything other than Off. Low. or High. There was no way to adjust it anywhere in between."
8,"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However. since Purina developed the smart-blend. she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes. change isn't better."
8,"These are a great price. and my dogs can't get enough of them!  I give them as gifts occasionally to friends with dogs. and they find their dogs love them as well.  I highly recommend.  I have two German Shepherd mixes (one with jaws of steel I think) and they stand up to the test.  Eventually they are worn down to nothing. but that usually takes 2 or 3 months. even with my more active chewer.Warning though. you don't want to step on these in the middle of the night!"
4,"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona. but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued. not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved. and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies."
7,"This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
4,"This is not a DVD. this is a world-wide experience. Everytime I watch this DVD. I realize exactly what Jesus did to save me and.as painful and hard as it is to watch. I love HIM even more. It's not for the faint of heart. it's not the traditional family movie. It is however a very essential DVD to receive as your own personal copy because it teaches you things through words and actions no other movie can teach you. I hope all who gets it appreciated all the effort taken to keeping it authentic in language. events and the message being told. Contrary to what happened to the director. this is his finest work. A masterpiece and a classic."
2,"Heavy. smooth action. sharp.  My husband makes an ultra-deep-dish 'priazzo' about 2 inches deep. and this cuts right through - extra pepperoni. extra veggies. extra cheese. extra thick crust. it can handle it all!  Plus. it feels good in your hand.  Nice piece of equipment.Update 7/3/12: I suddenly realized a couple of weeks ago that this wheel wasn't working as well as it used to. so I decided to sharpen it for the first time. It was a little tricky to run through my Chef's Mate. but it's working a little better now. I'm thinking I'll need to replace it in a year or so. Still. it was used about once a week for about 4.5 years; if I get another year out of it. that's not too shabby!"
10,"I just used this kit for the first time. I was gluing some melamine sheets with Roo Glue (specially made for melamine) The set up time was 15 minutes. so I had a lot of surface area to cover in short order. This glue kit. using the glue roller did a nice job. It enabled me to cover a lot of surface area quickly. The amount of glue that is released is based on how much you squeeze the container. You can easily see the flow. so guesstimating is pretty easy.My only dilemma is when doing biscuits and glue edge joinery; it is necessary to switch heads. When you are dealing with glue that is sure to get messy. So my quest is to find a dedicated biscuit joining glue bottle. That way I can use both at the same time without making head changes.I think this kit is a great idea. It might be all plastic. but is ideally suited for the purpose. Highly recommended."
8,"We use Frontline Plus for flea control because it works. We started with Advantage when our Golden was younger. and that worked well. too... but our dog likes to swim and Frontline is waterproof so we switched. She is 8 yrs old now and has never had a flea - which is amazing since we live in S.CA. near the beach where fleas abound and visit parks all the time. You are supposed to put on monthly... I end up putting on every other month and in winter every 2-3 months... seems to work fine with those intervals. Frontline isn't cheap - but Amazon has best price... Our Costco started carrying it for the same price. but no tax and free shipping gave Amazon the edge."
8,"This product is a great buy for the money.  I shopped around a lot and couldn't find anything to compare.  This is the second one I bought.  I've had the first one almost a year and it's still working.  It is pretty quiet and the timer works well.  My cats don't try to break into it like others seem to do.  It won't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep (since it's just water in plastic) but works well for a weekend away.  It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too!"
9,"The 6 piece set was more than I actuallly needed. but I didn't know where I was going to mount the speed bag and so I got the whole kit.  The speed bag is really good quality and the swivel is better than I thought it was going to be.  It is nice to have both the wrap and the gloves if you are a beginner because you may find that one suits you better than the other.  I did not end up using the platform but the frame leads me to believe that it is very sturdy.  The jump rope. ah. the jump rope is a nice touch and it is nice to have. but i's nothing special.If you are looking for a fun and challenging arm workout the speed bag is a lot of fun to learn. It is not about punching something as hard as you can it is about controlling your punch.  I like it. it's fun and it's a really good outlet on very bad days."
9,"Awesome Sharp knife. Had the old version for about 10 years and never needed to sharpen. It was not the skeleton like this but they do not make the non-skeleton version anymore of this. My old Gerber disappeared one day and I was sick about it. had a lot of memories tied to that knife. LOL...So decided to get this updated version of the model called the e-z out skeleton that they are selling now. SHARP. HOLDS an Edge and just kicks bottom. Took about a week to get use to flipping the blade out with one hand and thumb but now have that mastered.Love this knife so much keep it beside the bed at night and it is the first thing I look for when getting dressed in the morning."
2,"I've always loved cake decorating. ever since I took my first Wilton class.  Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but. I admit. a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps. my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book. as all Wilton Lesson Plans. it's great."
4,"I've had this tape for a little over a year. and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently. this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!"
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
3,"I have always had dogs and read dog books.  Recently got a kitten - turned big-boy cat and thought I might enjoy this book.  It was extremely difficult to read.  Almost caused me to have a panic attack.  If these things really go on out there - I guess I have been living under a rock.  A colleague was going to get it for his 9 year old daughter and I said NO  Not a book for kids to read.  I am hugging my big boy cat as I write this.  I will be on the lookout for any other Sisypuss vagabond cats out there from now on.AS BOB BARKER WOULD SAY:  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PET (and anyone else's you can afford to)."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
12,"Doom for PS1 is a great game. Almost every level from Ultimate Doom & Doom II is here. plus some new levels never before seen on the PC. This game is dark. scary as hell. and can really get in your head. The soundtrack is totally different from the PC. and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do. The controls are easy to learn. that's a good thing. However. the only reason why I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the graphics. Yes. as you may have already read. the graphics are a bit sluggish. especially when compared to the PC version. In my opinion. the best version of Doom is the PC version. period. Doom. Doom 2. and Final Doom are the best video games ever. in MY opinion."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"This has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the Nintendo 64. This kind of game is great for all ages. I'm 18 years old and my friends and I still. to this day. continue to play Mario kart. It is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours. You can play it by yourself. but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others. There is really no story line to the game. just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with. If you get bored of racing over and over again. there are several mini games. known as battle games. to choose from. Honestly. I like playing the battle games more than I like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family! So. overall I would definitely say get this game if you don't have it! It is a must buy for avid Nintendo 64 users!"
12,"Yes I said ONE of the best games ever made ...but not THE best. This game falls right behind... XENOGEARS. You probably havent played it since its very hard to get. But it's definently. in my opinnion the best game ever ...and if u have the chance then get it!!Anyways. FF7 has great graphics but the character models are totally ugly. The backrounds are very nice though. and so are the FMV'sThe gameplay is fun and addicting except ...THE BATTLE SYSTEM. Why is it that every Final Fantasy game has had a completely boring battle system. Why can't they make them like Xenogears??? Xenogears had a very very great and fun battle system. With battles like this in FF7. you'll always be wishing not to run into a enemy.The sound is perfectThe controls are easyThis game is great. period. And if you havent bought it yet then you are insane.Besides Xenogears. no game comes close to this"
9,"4 month update!well after about 4 month it has completely lost it's sharpening ability. minding that i do a lot of cutting. and I used this on every knife around the house. However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer. all an all i'm going to switch to sharpening stones.My Initial review:Sharpens the knives like never before! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it). rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade. works very well on a variety of steel grades."
3,"This is a greatest-hits grab bag of 25 stories from the Grimm's Fairy Tales collection. unillustrated. and apparently taken from the 1884 Margaret Hunt translation.

8,"It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not. My friend's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them. He has this one still after several months. The head is gone. but the rest is intact. My boyfriend's dog. however. only picks it up when she knows I'm waiting for her to play with it. My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around. if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp."
9,"I have a quite a few knives in my collection. ranging from spyderco's. benchmade. cold steel. ka bar to name a few. and this sharpener puts an extremely sharp and fine edge on all of them. It even makes cheap Chinese made knives hair shaving sharp. The DMT is by far the best and most simple to use sharpening stone I have ever come by. basically no skill is required to sharpen a knife with it. And hey it's made in the USA right in Massachusetts so u get good American quality. Don't think about it. just buy it!!"
12,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 - Circa 1999GOOD:- Good Balanced 2D fighter. considered a classic to many hardcore 2D fighting fans- Lots of modes to unlock and lots of fighters to choose fromBAD:- Loading times. very short but still there- Graphics might be dated for some peopleWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- Not over the top like Guilty Gear X/X2. Marvel Vs Capcom. or Capcom Vs SNK- Old School type game play and not combo heavyGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- King of fighters 2000 and up- Fatal Fury: Mark of WolvesADDITIONAL NOTES:- Last game in the Street Fighter 'Alpha' franchise (as of 1999)- Has all fighters from Street Fighters Alpha 1 and 2 as well as a few from the old time Street Fighter's like Street Fighter II: The world Tour- Street Fighter Alpha is called Street Fighter Zero in Japan- Practicality same game on Sega Dreamcast"
5,"A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there. but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal."
8,"First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty. but I still loved them. The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone. Now it is shaped a little weird. but I like it none the less. Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone. It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food... I just close my eyes and pretend.Conclusion: Great chew bone! Lasts a very long time. Not sure what could be improved."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
9,"I had one for my XD and now have a few more items I wish to keep SAFE from others using.  Not only a great price they are awesome to use and easy to change the codes for locking/unlocking.  I had lost the directions form my years ago one and nor have the easy instructions to change the codes.  Insert a pin into the opening and change the codes. how easier can it be. I could of had a V8 moment when I saw this....Silly me for forgetting..."
2,"I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.  This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First. I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next. I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial. yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last. this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one. but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again."
9,"After becoming pregnant. I've tried to carry water with my everywhere and not in a plastic container (due to chemicals. BPA. etc.) This sig coated aluminum works great - it doesn't have a taste and it cleans very easily with a bottle brush. and the lid with the hole is very very handy for toting around on my finger or carrying with one hand.I've actually dropped it several times so it has a few dents now. but I am glad I went with these instead of a glass bottle. which is also supposed to be very good to drink out of. but that would definitely have shattered by now. The little dents don't bother me and the outside color/finish is still fine. I prefer this size to the larger SIG sizes as it is not too heavy to carry around in my purse. and this has never once leaked on me. It keeps water nice and cold for a short time too."
7,"I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better."
8,"When frontline first came out it was strong enough that 1 dose would last on one of my dogs for over two months. it's not that strong anymore it seems.  It does however. work really well.  I want to use it specifically because it kills fleas as eggs and adults.  It will help with ticks but they are very hard to get rid of.  I get this size pkg and divide it up between my 8 dogs who range in size from 22lbs to 90 lbs. My vet gave me a syringe to get the liquid out of each of the vials and advised me on the correct dose for each dog.  It really saves money!"
12,"Super Mario 64(1997) When I first got Nintendo 64.it came with Super Mario 64.When the system was hooked up.I put in the game.and was amazed on how the graphics were!It was excellent.The graphics were great.the music was cool.and Mario never looked better!This game is for everyone.I thought Banjo-Kazooie was a great game.but move over Banjo.Mario is back!The best game ever.Features new worlds.characters.setting.and don't worry some of the old villians from the early Mario games are here.and can't forget Bowser and Princess Toadstool(Peach).Better than any 64 game ever made!"
12,"Ocarina Of Time is definitely the best game on the Nintendo 64.Super Mario 64.Perfect Dark and F Zero X are awesome but Ocarina Of Time is the best out of any other game on the system.What else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at Role Playing games forever?The graphics are awesome(some Game Cube games dont look this good) the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellent.Whereas the difficulty in Super Mario 64 stayed pretty much the same throughout the game Ocarina Of Time gets harder when you get to be a better player.Also you get an extra heart after beating bosses because youll need it.Its very challenging I still havent beaten it and am not sure if I ever will.Easy games can be a lot of fun but they just arent as substantial as a game like this.The challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls. Its just a great game and is a must for any Zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging games."
4,"The cast of Stomp is a great addition to this DVD.  My daughter fell in love with it the first time we watched it and asks for it repeatedly.  More importantly. it is not overly annoying to adults.How I rated this DVD:* Educational value.  Since buying this DVD my daughter has become very interested in making her own music.  I have found her stomping. making drums from rubbermade containers. and trying to blow in bottles.  She is only 20 months old and I think this is very impressive since we have only had the tape a few weeks.* Entertaining to child.  Keeps her entertained through the whole video.* Entertaining to adults.  I can even watch the tape with her and not become mindlessly numb.* The DVD starts right at the menu.  No annoying commercials to sit through.* Cost.  The video did not break the budget.  It was reasonably priced."
10,"If you are using this saw without clamps to hold what you are cutting. STOP RIGHT NOW if you value your fingers.Get one of two of these clamps! They are simple. well made and make your saw much safer. They can be mounted to the saw in a second. and can quickly and securely hold what you are working on. They have a quick release button and a micrometer type fine adjustment for tension. They swing out of the way easily when you don't need them. The rubber foot to hold the work piece is nice and big.Expensive? You Bet!  Overpriced? Absolutely! But then again. you have to ask yourself how much your fingers are worth to you!"
2,"Get the Presto. They're all the same. It's a simple design. a pot and lid. I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy. but when it comes to pressure cookers. it's not like other cookware where you 'get what you pay for.'  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers. Get the Presto."
9,"This knife is perfect for on your keychain carry. I went to a bbq this weekend and it was used multiple times for three different things. I had to pull it off my keychain because everyone needed a bottle opener for there beer. The scissors were used to open a capri sun that the straw was lost for a kid. And the knife was used to open a present. And when I told people it also has a pen they were shocked! awsome little knife just get it and put it on your keychain."
4,"I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out. with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs. with its jabs. too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love. I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!What's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen. that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!"
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of 'A Christmas Carol.'Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade. a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.His visit by the spirits. the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him. leads to a very sentimental ending.It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
12,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE GAMES. I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO PLAY !!IT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE . NOT TO MENTION LOADS OF FUN TOO !! THERE ARE ONLY A FEW HARD BOSSES . BUT WORTH THE PLAYING TIME . ONE TIP . ALWAYS STOCK UP ON AMMO . AND USE THE FOUNTAIN OF REJUVINATION ALWAYS .THROW YOUR DRUMSTICKS AT ENEMIES FOR HEALTH PICKUPS; BUT YOU GET THEM LATER IN THE GAME.  USE YOUR CROSSBOWS FOR BOSSES -AND PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BOOKS SCATTERED THRU THE LEVELS .THEY GIVE YOU CLUES.ALL IN ALL IF YOU YOU WANT TONS OF FUN . THEN GET THIS GAME! YOU 'LL CERTAINLY PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN !!"
5,"This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range. although it only does one effect at a time. so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock. which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds. excluding the heavier metal sounds. this pedal will definitely get you there."
7,"I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this . but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!"
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
4,"That is right. God bless Mel for making one of the most loved and profound depiction of Jesus' crucifixion.Let's face it. there were people in this country who've had it in for Mel sice production on this film began years back. When the worst they predicted failed to materialize they looked like the alarmist fools they are. Mel's tirades just gave them any excuse they needed to attack him all over again.Where is the condemnation for Gary Busey and Billy Zane for starring in an outright antisemitic movie depicting Jewish doctors as ghouls lusting for the body organs of Arabs?Where was the outrage for Marlon Brando when he called Jews 'kikes' right on the Larry King Show?Or what about Russell Crowe who not only once referred to the Maoris of New Zealand as 'niggers' but hit somebody with a telephone?Mel did a really stupid. horrible thing with what he said.But you know what? Suck it up. Accept the asology and let the man get on with his life and the great flicks he makes."
9,"The DMT family of knife sharpening products are top shelf kit.  I use them in the kitchen and in the garage. from sharpening a shovel (yes. it really works better when the edge is sharp) to sharpening steak knives.  These were purchased to add to my truck tool box. small. easy to stow away.  They work very well. just remember to let the sharpening edge do the work for you. do NOT press down hard. you will just remove the diamond media and ruin the surface."
5,"Even though the title says 'Acoustic Guitar Case'. it's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins. I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo. and the reviews were good. Sure enough. the lining is soft and well-padded. The hardware works as it should. and the build quality is almost perfect. However. when closing the case. a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place. then everything is as it should be. The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly. and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. It serves its purpose well. at a reasonable price."
12,"This is a more than ok game.Not the best.but good.If you like the &quot;Spyro&quot; series.you'll like this for sure.The gameplay. control.sound.etc. are all like the first 2.The only problem is it's EASY.Really.really easy.The levels are about 5 minutes long each.and the total gameplay span is about 7 hours.But still. thats better than it being hard.It's still pretty fun and stays true to the first 2.And Crash's little sister premires in it. Here's the review:Graphics:4/5Sound:5/5Music:3/5Fun:4/5Control:D-pad:3/5Analog:5/5Overall:4/5hould you buy it?:Yep"
2,"These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall. and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust. the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows. because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted. because they have a 'lip' at the bottom. that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window. to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place. so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene. for instance!)  Even so. the fan is easily removed. once the screws are in place."
2,"I've long been a fan of OXO utensils but I didn't think there was a good are bad when it came to peelers. I was wrong. I cook quite a bit and had used a peeler recently at my brother's house. When I got this one and used it. it was like night and day. It is surprisingly effective in peeling as if it were super sharp. but I've run it into my hand on accident a couple times and never been cut. There's something about the design of the blade that makes it pretty safe to use and still really quick at peeling. It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer. Nice little feature."
7,"When I originally set this up on our front porch railing. I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it. that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone. it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item. but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me."
3,"My Thoughts - 5 out of 5 unicorns - I loved it!!!**Gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewOkay first things. this is a very adult erotic short story.  It is only about 25 pages. and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some M/M/F.The cover is okay and shows the characters. but it doesn&#8217;t grab my attention.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to judge this book by its cover.Okay I loved this story. but if you aren&#8217;t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don&#8217;t read this story.  It is a quick read. but it totally had my attention.  You get glimpses into the lives of the 3 characters in this book and some background.  I&#8217;m not usually one for short stories. but Kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.I totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves Kally&#8217;s work.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more of this series in the future."
3,"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan. there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that. her best writing. in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total. the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series. you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.  Enjoy!"

And some are better than others!When your making some of the finest cabinets and doors in the world for some of the most demanding customers you can't second guess your self! Or worrie about your saw blades integrity!These blades will amaze your customers with fine bevels and hair line tight cross cut joints at any angel with any type of wood!!

3,"There is a love potion floating around the Ton and the males are droping out of their celibate states in record numbers. much to the dismay of the remaining few.Not quite believing the tale but secretly worried. Lord Vailmont sets out to discover the truth.The potion maker. Sylvia. has secrets to protect and a stepdaughter's season to finance. She has no time for Vailmont and everything to loose if he comes too close. Unfortunately. he is very attractive. Could her family spell book help her find a way to control her feelings ?This a a book about relunctant lovers. She does not want to love and he. definitively does not want to marry. The potion that even its maker think a fake. might have some magic in it after all. They are caught in their own games and secrets and love finds it way.This is light. funny. frothy reading."
7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
5,"Always buy D'Addario strings for my 7 guitars.  Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types.  They have a great rating from other musicians. ....and the price is very affordable.  Highly recommended by this writer.  It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food. musicians. movies....etc.  We all have our likes and dislikes.....For my taste D'Addario EJ16-3D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings.  I like their full sound and their lasting tones."
2,"I searched for an exhaust fan for our new. hot garage.  I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you!  This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months!  Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal; you don't have to touch it except to turn it off and on.  It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.  Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.  With all my searching. Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.  What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?"
8,"On June 15 I adopted a 2yr old jack-a-poo which was rescue from a puppy mill. Every time he ate he would make strange sounds. He would also throw up a lot. The foster mom had him eating wellness brand. I had him for 2 months and really had no idea what to do.I switch him over to Purina Pro Plan Sensitive skin and Stomach just to see if that would help. I am surprise at  the result. It is like having a new dog. He no long makes sounds or throw up. If he drinks water to fast he coughs but. other then that this food has fixed his issues.I highly recommend this if your dog has issues eating they may just need a different diet."
4,"The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray]This film (and particularly the extra disk) is very useful for those particular individuals of the Christian faith who were not given the opportunity to learn about the finer aspects of Christ's Passion. specifically the Stations of the Cross.  Having grown up in the Baptist Church. I was not taught about the Stations. but strict emphasis was given to why Christ gave himself for us.  Additionally. the second disk amplifies the finer aspects of crucifixion. shows where the Stations of the Cross supposedly were in Jerusalem. and Christ's suffering as depicted in the Arts.  It is for these reasons that I recommend this disk set.  Whether or not one accepts Mel Gibson's interpretation of the Passion of Christ is up to the individual and how/what he/she believes."
9,"Dr. Bronner's products are very very good.  I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower.  A little goes a long way.  The main thing is that it really does work!  It will really clear up what ails ya!  I use it as a shampoo too!  My scalp has never felt better.  Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount.  If a soap product such as this suds up heavily... then it probably isn't good for you at all...  This one will suds up a little... and it cleans very very well.  If you have dry skin. ring worm or fungus type skin issues. this will really help it.  Meanwhile. using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay."
8,"I have a miniature dachshund that is addicted to table food. Normaly I leave dry food available at all times and 1 bowl of wet food a day. He has always been a picky eater. basically just wanted human food. Recently he would take a bite or 2 of his dry food and barely touch his wet. So we decided to switch dog food. and ended up choosing this. He LOVES this stuff. I can't leave dry down anymore because he gobbles it up before it hits bowl! Also we buy the containers on Beneful wet food. he loves that as well!Another thing that I love about this food is it makes his coat shiny and soft. Not sure how but ever since he started eating this he has had softer and shinier coat."
2,"when given the choice. i always buy oxo. it's the most comfortable for my hands. this pizza wheel is great. sharp. and cuts clean. and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $3.99!!!!!! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price? uh. no. even if i didn't find it at $3.99. i would have bought it at bed. bath. and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons. amazon. if you want to stay competitive. price your items lower!"
10,"Bosch is the standard by which all other jig saw makers judge themselves. This in itself pretty much says it all. Once you use this tool. you will understand what that means.I prefer the barrel grip b/c it is easier for me to control. However. the handle model has all the same features. just a different grip configuration. so the choice is purely a personal one.This saw cuts through almost anything like butter. There is very little vibration. These features pair up to make your control over the tool excellent. and that is what you get a jig saw for!Changing blades is quick and easy. Changing the base angle is a snap.If you are looking for a jig saw you are going to have for a long time. then this is the tool to get."
8,"Purchased this Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow a couple of weeks ago. It makes a soft running water noise. pleasant to hear. My cat immediately started drinking from it. as she loves running water. Keeps water fresh and clean for her. easy to reload - just unhook the cord from the plug and take to sink. Makes a loud noise when there is debris in it (bugs. food. whatever) to let you know it must be cleaned out! so much easier than refilling the water dish all the time..."
10,"After about ten years of use I have nothing but praise for the 505. Certainly does what it's designed for and continues without fail. Honestly a tool that's a pleasure for me to use in that it has a good feel and balance to itRecently replaced the cord and found the Delta/Porter Cable (SeviceNet)online parts system easy to navigate and with very reasonable prices for parts and shipping. I suppose the lack of dust collection can be a minus but for me personally I don't use dust collection except for table saw. although I do wear a mask when sanding. Excellent tool with exceptional durability."
9,"Love this product. it always works as advertised. I bought a 32oz bottle on October 31st. it is now December 31st and I have used maybe half an inch of this soap. The upfront cost is expensive. but this stuff is very cost effective since a 32oz bottle will probably last me 1.5-2 years. I bought a 4oz one for travel (they didn't have the smaller one in stock) and I imagine it will work for many years to come. One problem is that I dropped my 32oz bottle while in the shower and it broke the top part of the cap off."
10,"After reading the reviews here on Amazon and with the great pricing on the DW788. I took the plunge and ordered both the saw and the stand.I've used several scroll saws over the past 40 years. I can say this is by far the best I've ever used!There is no vibration to this saw and the cuts are easy and flowing. and did I mention how quiet it is?If you're looking for a solid scroll saw. pay a little extra and get a solid machine. you won't be disappointed in the DW788.  Better get a dolly when it arrives. very heavy. solid product  A++"
3,"I have become a big fan of this e-magazine. along with the Hitchcock. Asimov and Analog mags. You can't ask for better escapism on your Kindle. My long que of books to read are gathering dust due to my new fondness for short fiction stories. Can't go wrong for the price if you enjoy reading. My only gripe is not being able to view the cover in color on my Kindle. Guess I'll need to buy the new Kindle Fire for that. If you like mysteries. detective stories. etc.. you'll enjoy EQMM. If nothing else. try the 14 day free trial and find out for yourself."
8,"My cats love this food...and the price is right.( usually a bit cheaper than any store) If you'll read the ingredients. the FIRST ingredient is not chicken meal or some by product. it's real chicken!! The cats love it. and it's very nutritious. We took this bag to our Veterinarian and showed him what our cats were eating...he was pleased and said go ahead and feed them this..and he had tons of food in his office he could've tried to sell us for our one cat's sensitive tummy.  He said this food is great!!  We won't feed them anything else!"
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
4,"Olivia de Havilland is at her best in My Cousin Rachel. I happened to catch this movie on TV and had never heard of it. I searched for it and found it and just had to ad it to my collection. Rachel is Manipulative. Deceptive and Conniving or isn't she? A black widow Spider. she mates and she kills or does she? This movie had me pulled into the story because you love Rachel and yet you hate Rachel. Olivia was a powerhouse and all the reason to see this movie. If you are a fan of Olivias then take a chance. this one will become a favorite for you as it did for me."
7,"This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!"
2,"Excellent durability.  Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now. you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall. very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split. so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes. the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still. it's a decent box that continues to function okay."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
8,"Our Apollo can't live without his Teddy! I've never had a dog so attached to his toy. He mangles it.runs with it and sleeps with it. Absolutely in love with it. It has held up better than any of his other toys...I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy. I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails. This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb. black Lab punishment...now that is a true test!!"
2,"I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products.  The meat tenderizer is another good product.  It is very ergonomic. and it's heavy/solid so that you don't have to pound as hard as you would with more lightweight tenderizers.I don't like the fact that you can't put it in the dishwasher. but really. scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you're all set.  After shopping at several home product stores in search of a tenderizer. I came back to the OXO Good Grips because I found it the best. in spite of not being able to put it in the dishwasher."
5,"These D'Addario  strings are great!  I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using. these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life.  Intonation is good and I've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat. even more so than my Sheraton.  Being from the 'old school' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper. but what can ya do? Besides that. I am totally stoked and happy with these.  I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good."
5,"...but for a small woman with small hands. it's difficult to operate.  It also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings. which can't be good for them.  I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock. a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both. if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.  When playing at home I'll use the more gentle Schubb."
8,"Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I've found. They are much sturdier (you won't stick your hand through) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up. These are pretty good sized. so it's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds.The packaging is well designed too. The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel. Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them. A++ product. If you have dogs. you really should try these baggies!"
9,"This must be more ideal for a handgun.  The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15. Remington 12 gauge. nor my Reuger .22.  The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger. however. when I tried that. I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun.  The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved.  I should have returned it. but I was lazy."
12,"Such a necessity that once I received it for Christmas I got rid of the Jumper Pak for good.The Expansion pak holds MUCH more memory.If you have games that need it ask mom and dad night and day to buy you an Expansion Pak.You really have no need for the Jumper Pak.The Jumper Pak is really hard to get out anyway.I had to use a knife to get the Jumper Pak out which cant be too good for the system but what the hey now the Expansion Pak is in and I dont need to worry anymore."
7,"Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1."
7,"I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof. EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging. no squirrels. great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price. I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
2,"Searched high and low for the perfect tongs for non-stick surfaces that didn't cost a fortune and of course found the OXO brand to perfectly fit the bill (as usual).  These are not too long. perfect for kitchen use.  Their tips are not the annoying soft silicone type like so many out there but instead a harder tip that is angled and pointed so you can use then for a number of surfaces or into pots of boiling things.  I really love the feel of these in my smallish hands and that they lock is an added bonus so they don't take up tons of room in your drawer.  Perfect!"
8,"I erroneously assumed that I'd get what was shown in all the photos - a T-Rex.  The listing title says &#34;dinosaur varies&#34; and the listing points include &#8226;Available in Brontosaurus. Stegosaurus and T-Rex.  There wasn't an option for me to choose. and I wish it had been clearer to me that the packers would chose what toy I was sent; I would have purchased this from a different shop.Instead of a T-Rex. I got a brontosaurus with a long thin neck that looks like it would be easy to chew off.  My dog doesn't care what dino he got. But the Rex shape looks a lot more durable."
7,"I love Perky-Pet feeders. but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything. especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil. and 1 part white sugar. let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this. you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes. and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar. and small insects."
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
12,"This game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo. They have other games. they rent other games. but they keep coming back to this one.They like the two player option. They like the challenge  (they're not teens yet). They like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games. They like being able to set their and the opponent's  skill levels. They just love this game!I personally wish it were a  little less violent. but compared to other games out there. this is a  teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of. buy this  game."
7,"This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill. so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it. I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead. I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer. but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building). and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box. you probably have a defective battery."
12,"I loved the game the first time i played it through. but as with MOST (not all) games. it got boring the second time around...:(...It strays far from the movie. It has the basic characters. but is not like the movie. You will recognize a few items and place from the movie...like the palace. of the last part of the game. where you defeat Darth Maul. but it was just kind of a game to sell and make money...It's fun. but doesn't lastJason Anderson"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
7,"I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet. but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further. but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly. and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now. i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
4,"We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now!HOWEVER. I do have just one small complaint.  The 'chapters' are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me..."
7,"The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor. and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds."
10,"I won't bore you with repeating the specs or features of the biscuit joiner as the other reviews cover them quite well. I've had this tool for about 6 months now and am delighted with it. I had the porter cable model which is quite a bit more expensive. I found it to be bulkier to use than the DeWalt and a lot more likely to slip away from your alignment marks than the DeWalt. This cutter has pins on both sides of the blade that go a long way to help keeping the cutter in line with the wood.. The only drawback is that the dust chute will clog with the dust bag installed when cutting into long grained softwoods.Having owned both the porter cable and the Dewalt I must give a big nod to the DeWALT. Smaller and easier to use and a few $$ less."
3,"I've been reading USA Today for over 5 years. I love the content. the features. the pictures. It's my favorite newspaper.Trying out the Kindle version. you get the articles but sometimes they're not formatted correctly. I did notice some black and white photos. Even if they had the photos that accompany the article in black and white that would be good.I tried it for a week while on vacation. I was able to keep up to date with the news but after that week. I decided to cancel it. I can't see myself canceling my print edition to read it on  Kindle.Hopefully. they'll improve it in the future. But now. just try it out for free to see for yourself."
12,"This. for me. was truly a wonderful experience. I've played this game countless times. yet over and over I find myself wondering why. When I first played this game. I had no idea I was immersing myself into the abstract but gorgeous world of Final Fantasy VII. You are the hero. of course. and you're out to save the world. one step at a time. And really. that's exactly what you do in FFVII. In classic Final Fantasy style. the seventh game in the series brings Cloud. a mercenary now working for a terrorist group. into your head. As you play. you can really understand where the characters come from and what their real selves are like. It might sound weird. but this is truly an incredible game. A wonderful experience for anyone who likes this series. or anyone looking for an absolutely outstanding story."
2,"This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other's reviews.but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture.like soft serve as other's have said.so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me.sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact.Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty.also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red."
12,"Words really can describe how wonderful this game is. The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics (note: a 3D card is not required!.) Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions (who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions.) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics. it makes this a very absorbing adventure. This is one of the few games that I can't say anything negative about. This is a must have!"
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
5,"Hey jerks. do you play guitar?  Well. if you do. you need strings.  Well. you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar.  If so. you can stop reading.  If you use strings. you should buy them your damn self.  While you're at it. buy ten sets.  Seriously. are you a child?  Always have extra strings.  D'Addarios last a long time for me. and they sound good.  Also. they're on the bottom end of the price range.  Buy some strings. douchnozzle."
9,"I ordered this 29.5' basketball with the only intention of playing with my young son. Having said that. I was not too worried about getting a more professional ball.For starters I could not play with it out of the package as it did not have enough air in it. so we had to wait until I could have it inflated (unfortunately I do not have the needed tools at home) The ball looks really cool. it is light and has a nice grip.We have had it for a little over a week and we like it so far. again. I am not playing professionally or anything like that. it is a basket ball I am using to teach my young son how to play so. works great for me!"
2,"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However. the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for 'cake decorating ideas' when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly. if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it."
2,"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the 'preservatives' in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half. it was amazing!As for the noise it makes. I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room. closing the door and setting a time. lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year."
4,"I have a lot of fun with this video. I will admit. like a lot of other workouts. it takes some getting used to. I had to do this three times before I learned all the routines. There are very few workouts that I can pick up on the first try.Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke take you through every move and I don't think they are too fast to keep up with.  They stress to go at your own pace. anyway.  (Taebo is just too fast for me)The first time I used this video. my back muscles were a little sore. I also lift light weights (Kathy Smith's weight training of course). so I am used to using my back and arm muscles.I like this video much more than her 'Aerobox Workout'."
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
7,"Bought this in the summer (much cheaper then) and put it out about 2 months ago.  We have our own 'homemade' fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid. combined with the moving water from the fountain.  Night time temps have averaging about 15 F.  The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very. very short. about a foot long.  That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord. It is sturdy and does not get too warm.  You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill."
4,"Of all the movies i've seen about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ. this movie has the most accurate portrayal as I've seen so far even though in the bible Jesus had suffered a far more gruesome beatings than what was shown in film but it's as close as it gets. The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion. However I suggest that people watch this film with caution. it shows alot of graphic stuff including blood and it's definately not for younger children.  It's a great film overall."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
4,"I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!"
7,"These are perfect kabob skewers.  Very sturdy. sharp point to get through food. wide flat edge so the food doesn't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers.  More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these. they should last forever.  Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long.  I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe.  If you have a small grill these may not work.  Otherwise. they are perfect."
2,"I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate. even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds. and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
2,"This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time. When the bag gets full. pop out that one and replace it with a new one. My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug. No. it's not great on the rug. But the floors with dog and cat hair. dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time. Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture. dog pillows. and even the cob webs that appear now and again. This was a marginally careful purchase. My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years. the previous one for eight. Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me."
2,"I absolutely love this corer! It's incredibly easy to use. and the best part is that it doesn't seem to have any sharp edges I can cut myself on. Clutz-approved! Despite lacking sharp edges. it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force. OXO handles are great. as I have quite a few of their other products in my kitchen. and this has lived up to it's non-slip standard. If you miss getting all the seeds out the first time. no worries! It comes out as easily as it goes in and and you can try again. Just try not to get too crazy with it. or you'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left!"
5,"Not much to say. these are your basic hex core. nickel plated round wound strings.  They are the equivalent ofErnie Ball Slinkys (Yellow)They play nice. and feel pretty much the same in my humble (non-touring musician's) opinion.Also. it's nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer.  As a note these come packed together in a single bag. with color coded washers. (as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeve.)In summary. if you're searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren't reading this review. you're out experimenting.  For others. the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more."
9,"I thought I could get away with my standard seat on the new bicycle I got.  It seemed pretty comfortable on my quick ride around the neighborhood.  But after I installed this. I rode 4x around the neighborhood without feeling a thing.  It doesn't seem like it would do much when you put it on. but I have to say it has made my ride feel like air.  It feels like I am just riding on my peddles and frame.  I can't recommend the gel seat enough.  This one fit my bike very well and for a great price.  Highly recommend it!"
4,"I have never had so much fun with an exercise video until I did the 'Latin Workout'. I was very impressed with Kathy and her assistants. The music was marvelous and very authentic. I love Afro-Cuban music. I really worked up a sweat. You can get a lot out of this video when you put more effort into the moves. This video is so enjoyable the time just flies by. I really had to get used to moving my hips. It felt so dirty but in a nice and sexy sort of way. I can exercise to this video everyday. So if anyone is considering starting an exercise program with a lot of fun. start off with this video."
12,"Street fighter alpha 3 might be the best street fighter out there to date. It has awesome game modes cool levels and best of all its the never ending fun of a 2d fighter. The graphics are what you would expect froma 3d fighter a little choppy and an occasional glitch or two or maybe an occasional mergence of fighters but all in all its one of my favorite game out there. Ihave been an avis street fighter fan all the way back to the SNES version of street fighter 2 turbo! i would encourage anybody to get street fighter alpha 3 because its fun and hey its down to 20 bucks now!"
7,"We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews. we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon. the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck. if you're old enough to remember!!"
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
9,"This is a wonderful ball.  I know because we bought the first one over a year ago for my son's birthday.  We bought one similar maybe the exact one before but he didn't write his name on it and it never came back home after a practice.  It has a nice 'sticky' grip. feels secure when grasp. and for preparing to shoot. It holds air well and doesn't need to be re-inflated except maybe check it at the start of the season.  Has a nice vibrant feel to the bounce and is all that you'd expect in a quality ball.  I highly recommend it to all. It even arrives inflated for immediate play."
10,"This is a dead-on accurate piece of art right out of the box. I use it in shop for many fine furniture cuts that need to be tuxedo accurate instead of using my radial arm saw. In the rough construction field. it works all day long on a small honda (2000) generator with no complaints. If you knock it out of alignment from roughing it up too much in the field (all saws will suffer from this fate.) just take the time to square it up. and you're good to go again! I have found absolutely no issues with this product"
3,"I wish I could give half stars. If so. I would give this 3 1/2 stars. but I can't so I will be nice and give it 4. It's not a bad book for the price (I got mine for $0.99). I will say that the editing was simply atrocious. but if you can get around that. it is a quick read. The characters are likeable and the story moves along pretty quickly. However. there were a few parts that I felt were too contrived and not overly believable to actually happen in real life. BUT. the love scenes were HOT and steamy. very well done. I finished this in a day. so go ahead and read this if you are a fan of the author (which I am) and are interested in escaping reality for a few hours."
9,"First. let me tell you that I have not yet ordered the larger size bottle from Amazon. but sure will! I wanted to try it first by getting the smallest bottle from Kroger to see how I liked it.I started by filling up my hand soap dispensers and then showering with it and I really like it! My skin feels so light and clean and not dry at all.I have not shampooed with it (a little scared to although I don't know why?); nor have I cleaned with it yet. For cleaning. I only use a vinegar/water spray and I'm happy with that.The peppermint is invigorating and fun but a friend of mine tells me I might like some of the other fragrances better. I would love to try them all!Once I have tried other things. I might update my review to 5 stars but didn't think it was quite honest or fair to do so yet.You'll be glad you made the switch!"
8,"This cat food contains a lower level of magnesium than the 'supermarket' cat foods. Low magnesium levels help to prevent urethra problems. especially in male cats due to their more narrow urethra. I would rather pay the higher price for this brand of cat food than bring my cats to an emergency vet in the middle of the night because their urinary tract gets blocked. not to mention the aggravation caused to the cat. Other brands of low magnesium cat food include Iam's and Nutro-Max. Hill's Science Diet food is round-shaped. rather than 'hooked'. which makes it easier for one of my older tooth-challenged cats to swallow."
9,"[update 10/24/2008]  My daughter is now four - we still use the trailer for long rides and she still loves it.  The construction of the unit is decent and has held up well.----The trailer is really easy to set up - five minutes if you have a quick release for the back wheel of the host bike.  The ride is pleasant (meaning very smooth) for both the parent and child.  Like others have mentioned. the toddler loves their personal space.  Plenty of 'whees' when we coast down hills.I envision after my toddler out grows the trailer that I can use it for running errands.This is a non-brainer purchase."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
5,"Simple. compact. well constructed. easy to use. and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo. designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make. each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar. Heritage Cherry Sunburst). aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar. Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge. andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar. Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck. it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock. Not a huge deal. but a consideration."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
7,"I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents. none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%. not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon. my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys. you should too."
7,"This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant!  (If you can bear to think of it that way!)  It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches.  I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner--and I don't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that's too thick for it.  Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes. too.  The length comes in real handy when I'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods. we'll be pruning our roses in mid-February.  So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores."
2,"This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.  Its black. rubberized grip has a section of 'gills' that molds to your grip for better control.  When you're done. just pop it in the dishwasher.  The only drawback is that with long term use. the 'gills' sometimes break off.  It took years for that to happen to mine (only one section).This is hardly an elegant device. but it works well and is perfect for everyday and outdoor use.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
3,"The book. originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic. reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published. especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic. it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However. I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created.  The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted. but it DOES have photographs. The decision. therefore. is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos. while not spectacular. greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition."
10,"I bought one of these for light duty planing tasks - relieving corners. cutting dowels flush and etc.  You do have to hone the pre-ground edge  before you use it the first time.  It is ground to 25 degrees and  recommended final angle is 30 after honing.  I used a Veritas honing guide  and a Japanese water stone to do the job.  It only took about 5 minutes  with the right tools!The mouth is easily adjustable with the front knob  to regulate the size of your curls.  The blade is easy to adjust with the  brass knob at the back.  It is easy to grip and use.  I look forward to  getting may years of use out of this well made tool!"
7,"We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile. I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden."
5,"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name. but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product. but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret. my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me. my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too..."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
2,"Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.  Bought one two days ago and bought a load of milk and supplies cause figured it would take 5 or 6 times to get it right.  have made 4 ice creams already.  So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.  used mostly the recipes that came with the machine except that being lactose intolerant. i used lactaid milk and also used baking splenda instead of sugar.  It worked out fine. But. i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.  and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.  We are real happy with this for sure."
8,"I have 3 spoiled dogs.  Puperoni was the only pricey soft treat they'd eat.  Then I tried beef Zukes as something cheaper and different.  They smell awful to me. but the dogs all grabbed these little squares and gobbled them up....to my surprise.  I then bought the Chicken Zuke's. which they rejected.  So It's back to the beef recipe.  Since all my dogs are older. I figured that the extra benifit of 'hip action' would be a good thing"
3,"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder. a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls. vampires. and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book. The Mister Trophy. hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them. I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third. longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank. what are you and Samhain waiting for?"
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
9,"I like to have this small one in my pocket for daily use.  It's small enough so it is less bulky than my car key and alarm bob.  It has the basic knife. combination screwdriver and nail file. and a small scissor; everything I've needed in a pinch when at work or out-and-about.  There's a pull out tweezer and toothpick. but I rarely use those.  Unfortunately. I had to give my last one to TSA at the airport.  I've gotten so used to slipping it into my pocket. it's hard to purposely not take it along."
8,"I have 2 cats and one is getting chubby. plus I'm tired of always feeding them regularly.  I needed this for when I was out of town anyway. This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them. I don't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site. Besides. it's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom---a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that."
3,"I wasn't sure to expect when I ordered this book. I've heard great reviews. but sometimes when I get around to reading the book. it just doesn't live up to the hype. Not so in this case.I sincerely enjoyed this tale of the young. innocent Oliver Twist and his story of misfortune. While the novel was darker and more violent than I'd at first anticipated. the language flows like poetry. I loved the roller coaster ride Dickens takes us on as Oliver searches to escape the evils forced upon him. only to be pulled back in. The build to the climax of the story was expertly formulated and executed.Oliver Twist is a classic in the true sense of the word. If you've not had the pleasure of reading this novel. don't delay. Order it today."
9,"Lets face it. its not worth putting an expensive scope on a .22 rifle.  I put this on my Remington 597 plinker rifle and it works great.  I shot a few hundred rounds this last weekend at 50 yards and had no problems with the scope.  For [...] bucks. its a steal!  The scope is built well and comes with a wrench for the scope rings.  The scope is easy to sight in as well.  You can't really use your fingers. but you can use a spent casing or coin to turn it."
5,"I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff.I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so.It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as 'black' as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings.They also seem to have more 'string squeak' when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that 'vintage tone' but they do sound decent.However. for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings (.009-.042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings. Super Light. 9-42.EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me. but I am a Da-Dairy-O man. for now."
3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"Aerobie rings are awesome as for distance. though you have to have good control.  Otherwise. you may find it leaves your neighborhood.It's good for kids when learning. because it will still fly if they flub the toss.They don't hold up to UV and weather really well.  A year in the backyard and the plastic is faded and brittle.  YMMV. but it should last a long time if you bring it in when you're done with it.Be advised that while the image shows a three-pack. you get only one.  They're a little pricey. but not too bad if you're expecting it."
9,"I cannot recommend this grill/griddle enough. since it is so versatile and easy to use and clean.  It makes a whole breakfast from bacon and eggs and pancakes. Flip it over and it is an excellent grill for meats and fish.  And it works well on gas and charcoal cook surfaces as well as electric.  I has a gas stove and am always in awe whenever I use it since it makes cooking so much fun.  And the price is excellent.  I have scads of cast iron from this grill/griddle. to fry pans of all sizes. and cornbread pans and other items.  Stuff never wears out and gets handed down generation to generation."
2,"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating. & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter. too.  Tonight. I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
8,"I recently got a puppy who is chewing on everything. except most of the puppy toys.  This is one of the exceptions.  He loves it.  His two favorite things are his Mr. Bill doll and his bully stick.  Both of them are holding up well.  If I activate the &#34;Oh. noooooo&#34; sound. he pounces on it and jumps around.  If he activates it in his mouth. he does a demonstration of the shaken baby syndrome and runs around the house.  I am amazed at the abuse this toy has taken.  If he ever destroys it. I will be getting him another.  As to the reviewer who bought it for his brother. not realizing it was a dog toy. I am sure any fan of Mr. Bill (and maybe even those who have never heard of Mr. Bill) would love to have this doll."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
5,"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well. I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also. you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little 'comb' that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me. and the Vox is very good. I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
8,"This is in no way a Giant cat litter pan. lol. I ordered it based on the description that it was larger than large-that it was giant. I have a cat on the larger side and thought this would be bigger than the large pans found in pet stores.It's not.I ordered a large cat litter pan from amazon for $5.99 that is larger than this one.The pan is of nice quality though. I think it would be perfect for a medium sized kitty.I'll be returning this. False advertising is a pet peeve."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
5,"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it. a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable. there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft"
8,"At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so. it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better. but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use. the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it. but it just won't go in reverse. Overall. this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY."
9,"I wish they had the attachment to use different socket tips. FIrst day I took it up into the Alpine regieon of the Rocky MOuntains. BAMB! I cut my thumb on the blade!  Old EMT trainng came into effect ... hehe.  I will comment later when I use it more. I bought this to see how will the saw blades will work for carving/sawing wooden triggers for snares and dead falls. Not sure this device will be up to it.It's slick and easy to keep clean.  The pouch is nice and I wear it when I go out of the house I do have confidence it will come in handy for several years.UPDATE:After 3 months I bought another as my son wanted a version of a Leatherman ... so I bought him this one. Be careful ... I cut myself again!"
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
2,"I suddenly had a need for more paring knives so I decided to buy four various models on Amazon to try them out.  This is by far my favorite.  They are extremely sharp and the rubberized grip is very comfortable.  When I reach into my drawer I tend to want to grab this knife over the others but have to tell myself to rotate through all of them.  I've had it for over three months now with use almost every three days and so far no sign of any type of oxidation or staining.  I wash it in a dishwasher all the time as well."
2,"I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto. missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks."
12,"Made in 98. but still better quality. play. and design than most games on the market in '05.  Good storyline. great AI and graphics. not-overly aggressive system requirments. tons of add-ons available.  Incredible single player mode. good weapon selection. and arguably one of the best FPS online games of all time.  If you like HALO. you will like Halflife.  Very similar. but no limit on how many weapons you can carry. and the levels aren't as repetative.  (My biggest complaint about Halo. though it's obvious why. many of the levels and hallways are exact copies of one you've seen dozens of times already...gives a feeling of being lost. and even fed up at times.) Halo does have the edge as far as cars and what not though. I also recommend Halflife 2. the sequel to what I'm talkin about here...  INSANE graphics and gameplay."
10,"Great instructions allow this stand to be put together with few tools and frustration in a short time.  The ability to assemble the stand with a built in tilt is great for clearing chips from the saw by gravity as it is in operation.  They even supply a few extra pieces of the assembly nuts and bolts in case you loose one of the small easy to loose parts.  Far better than having one or two short and not being able to finish the assembly with out a trip to the local hardware store.  The tripod design insures all feet will remain flat on the floor at all times.  Not too wide so it takes up little floor space in a smaller shop.  Light weight and strong. it serves well."
8,"We have been using this for less then a week and our 14 year old Pit Bull X is running around like a 9 year old!!! She had been starting to make ALLOT of cracking noises while stretching. especially in her neck and we noticed her slowing down.  Within 2 days the cracking sound is gone and she is able to go for family walks again and keep up with her 4 year old Catahoula brother.  Added bonus is that she LOVES the taste of the gravy that you get when you add water to the powder... I can't recommend this product enough and will be ordering the 20 lb once the 5 lb container is finished."
2,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6&quot; utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy. it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
9,"I have owned a Stanley thermos for years and they were built like a tank and made in the USA. I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is. While it may look like the old American made Stanley. it is just a veneer of it's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk. I would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation. Don't waste your money as the companies soul died some time ago."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
9,"We have three of these. one for each kid. They have been well used by all three children and have held up well to the use. They fold down to a very slim size that fits well under our seats or in our trunk. We have had them for some time and the children are able to fold them up and open them up without extra help from mom and dad (always a plus).The one negative that I have found is that if you get the lever that is used to lock the scooter open (or closed) at all dirty it will jam and not open or shut very easily. A quick clean will fix this. but it is something to watch for.A small adult can easily use this with no difficulties. If you are a heavier adult or tall. you might want to look for a sturdier scooter meant to hold adults.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
10,"I bought this for a one person shop.  My original intent was to have one hose and pull it to the tool I was using.1st. If you plan to use cheaper hose in a one tool per time system. the fact that the in-feed is on top of the unit. the weight of the hose will crimp thinner hoses.2nd. this sucker does not roll for beans. it has 4 wheels two are fixed and to rotate. if you happen to be pulling in the direction that the rear wheels are pointing (Rarely are you pulling to where you already are) you're good. if not your in trouble.I ran a more permanent system and with blast gates it has plenty of power to run jointers. planers router tables.  Just myobservations."
12,"Played it for the first time. after it has been out for over ten years.  Great game.  The puzzles are hard. but not impossible to solve.  If you truly love Myst. then you will certainly love this game.  (Do not use walkthroughs. it ruins the game!)  Also. keep in mind that the 5-CD Riven set is for outdated computers.  It will most likely not run on Vista or XP. at least not without some major glitches.  Wish I had played this sooner."
12,"All in all. this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time. Of course. it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female. evil castle. jump on enemies. etc. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that. occasionally. it works really well. Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection. Although we question Nintendo's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president. they did so for a good cause. and a damn good game."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Bought the pink one for dd so she could have a scooter like her brothers.She gets around on that thing too fast i think lol.What can i say it is a Razor they are the best. We have a few other brands and they are not as easy to close up and store as the Razors are.Great scooter and super way for them to get good exercise and just enjoy being a kid! Too bad i never had one growing up oh wait that is ok because honestly i use theirs sometimes lol!"
10,"If you get this on sale its not a bad kit.  I have used the bisket tip and found that helpfull and I like the roller a lot.  You only have so much working time and the faster you can get the glue where you want it the better.  Also you want full coverage but as little squeeze out as possible.  Any glue smeared on the wood and your stains wont take.  This kit would be better with about three bottles because you usually need more than one tip at a time (or tips and the roller).  Most of the tips are for wooden dowels. I could have used a few less of those."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
4,"It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles.  I also did not experience in the fervent passion and zeal that the movie was supposedly causing.I think the hype is a bit much for the product.I'd advise you not to have 'treats' or a meal as you watch this movie.  We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time.  This movie is pure ancient Roman gore.  This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie.  It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out.  It's unnerving to think of how many 'Boots' sat out in those movie theaters. and how many are now sitting in the livingroom with  'mummsy and dahdah.' I mean we're talking graphic angles of torture devices on the skin as never before seen etc."
8,"I have a 2 year old male tabby and a 6 year old female tuxedo cat. Both of them are slightly overweight so I started feeding them this dry cat food a year ago. 4 month ago my male cat developed urinary track blockage (crystal) so we have to keep him on canned food diet. We couldn't be sure the exact cause of the blockage (food. stress. genetic...) My female cat would not eat canned food so we let her keep eating Pro Plan's Weight Management dry food.Now my female cat got urinary track  blockage as well!  I am kicking myself have been keeping her on this dry food.Do not feed your cat this food. Urinary track blockage is very costly to treat. Once they get it. it could be a life long battle. Be carful!"
10,"I purchased this as a first plate jointer to get some experience with how they can be used in my projects.  I haven't experienced the issues with noise that several reviewers have noticed.  Considering many of these jointers can go for double the money. and that my projects are relatively basic. this seemed to be a good match.  I think this is a great unit for beginners or as a backup unit.UPDATE FEBRUARY 2009 - When I bought this unit. I figured it'd be good for maybe a year or two.  Four years out. it continues strong.  It has an annoying tendency for the chip chute to clog up from time to time. which takes a bit of effort to unclog.  But it does great work. and with a little bit of care ensuring your alignment is clean. it works well.  Wish all of my tools were as bulletproof."
10,"It seems that every class of tool has one brand or model that really works just right. Others try to upstage it with different gimmicks. but the obvious best choice keeps coming through. You see it on jobsite after jobsite. P/C routers. Skil wormdrives. Senco finish nailers. Bosch jigsaws...In the 3x21 sander category there is no better tool. Simple. balanced. sturdy  and inexpensive for the long-haul.Square shape and small body mean that one-handed operation (large hand) is practical. allowing for use in ways to which other models don't adapt well.This is my second one in (I don't remember. 15?) years. but a long time anyway. Someone decided they needed my first one more than I did and helped themselves; it'll probably last them forever if they were smart enough to keep it. So I got the latest iteration which is just still the best. I think I paid about the same the first time too."
7,"As a Christmas gift to a friend. I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds. not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice. gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!"
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
8,"I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle.  I thought no way does she tear through this &#34;indestructible&#34; teddy bear.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off... What a joke.  KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage.  I read the reviews and thought &#34;well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog&#34;... NOPE. my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes.  Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys."
2,"There was a review titled &#34;Didn't Fit&#34; which stated:&#34;Be warned! If you are looking for the &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; bag for a Hoover Wind Tunnel vac. don't assume a &#34;Type Z&#34; bag will fit....it won't!&#34;I don't doubt the reviewer got a product which doesn't fit.  Maybe hoover does weird things.  I double checked. and the previous bags I used were &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; - the last one is still in the vacuum.  I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine.  So. I'm not sure what happened with the poor fellow which got ones which didn't fit. but worked just fine for me.It's the genuine hoover product. not the knockoffs sold on here as well.  I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever. when these bags last months.  Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly."
4,"This movie was great. my wife and I decided to go see it last Saturday night. Jesus was played by the young and attractive heart throb. James Caviezel. Jesus was taunted ruthlessly. Jesus was beaten mercilessly. Jesus was whipped until every inch of his body bled. Jesus was kicked. spit on. and humiliated. Finally he was crucified.Needless to say my wife and went home and I had the best sex of our life after later that night after the flick.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it wasn't Monica Bellucci who did the whipping."
4,"this is the type of movie I would definitly recommend it for first time viewer but on personal note I would also say I will never watch this again. the thing is despite its christ we are talking about. it is still very hard for me to looking at a man being tortured like a hanging lamb in the kitchen while is considering myself is being entained in a movie.. IT IS TOO GROSS! the fact is it goes beyond the line there are anything horible things you ve seen in movie theater. that's what credit this movie as one unforgettable one in history. By comparing this to Hannibal. Hann is barely just a little kid's nitemare. Every minute of this movie chanllenge your sense to tolerante the scale of brutality upon someone to a new level. I would say if your a believer it could work better since the man you looking at aint normal human to you after all. so its more relief since its a 'super being' is tortured but not human like you and me..."
12,"When I had this game. I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game. It's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you. It has a four player mode. which is not bad. but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although. that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games. too. I wouldn't mind playing this. Oh. I have the one on Gameboy Advance. which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64. Now. that confused me."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
2,"My last masher (from a respected and pricey brand name) couldn't take the pressure-literally!  One day I'm just mashing up a batch of potatoes and *snap&#34; it's time for the trash bin.  That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid. heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.  I'm not sure I could break it if I tried!  Works great at mashing (just as good as one with square or circle holes). and the large grip makes it easy to hold even if you get a little butter on your hands (trust me. I have done it)."
11,"If I'm being honest. I must mention that although this game specifies 'thirteen and older' as its primary audience. the reality is that twelve and under kids are most likely going to enjoy this game. It's a party game that families can play. but accomplishing the tasks on the cards is more like kid-oriented fun. Gathering beads in order to win is the object. but unlike the real Mardi Gras there is no 'adults only' behavior involved. I rated the durability high. but again this is a game that should appeal to younger kids - who are prone to losing things like the strings of beads or the cards. The game comes in kind of a cool clear. soft vinyl case. I liked the 'mind control' category the best. which entails a little more subtle strategy that getting someone to refuse to pick your trash or finding someone who likes vampires more than werewolves. This is a game I can't imagine bringing out very often and its kind of expensive for what it is."
5,"I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means. but for what they're worth. I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price. ability to collapse. and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
2,"I got the 35-gallon size to store some items in the basement that I wanted to be able to get to conveniently but also be able to lock up and keep out of the kids' hands. This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course. I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that. but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is. I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it. I recommend you get the 'cable' style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible. but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable."
9,"UPDATE:  Initially gave this 5 stars because of good function.  But after only 9 months. the rubber that seals the goggles against the eyes is cracking and brittle.  I din't expect them to last forever but less than a year is still disappointing.  They have been used fairly heavily I would say.  END OF UPDATE.  Sometimes I hesitate to buy something because it seems too cheap.  These aren't going to last forever but what they do well is keep water out of your eyes and they have flat lenses so your view isn't distorted like with some goggles.  We'll see how long they last."
4,"The overall impression of this movie is of a very nice movie for children; almost everything about this movie is suitably designed for young children. I have not read the books and watched this one on a hunch. The movie was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching all the way to the end but I would expect many members of the younger audience. pre-teen for example. to enjoy the movie much more.Of the actors only one was familiar and that was Dean Jones and he was also one of the few that didn't specifically look like they were acting.The scenery was beautiful and had some very lovely settings in the woods of North Carolina. The overall ambience of the movie was appropriate for a young audience as well. This is a good solid move for children and I recommend it as such."
11,"I got this for a six hour car drive to entertain a 4 year old boy.  It kept him busy for quite a while. I don't let my son play with car toys except when we are on long trips (they stay novel then and he is kept busy for longer requiring less frequent stops and we can keep driving) so I can't speak about durability or if the wax sticks will keep up their sticking power.  It took my son a while to realize he didn't have to follow the books directions and could make his own designs but I think that is a function of age rather than product design.  Over all I think this is a worth while purchase for travel."
3,"Kasey Johnson is a professional basketball player.  His twin brother Garrett is a famous actor. They're both gay but Kasey isn't out.  Ingram Fletcher is the owner of Liverpool. a night club that Kasey and Garrett frequent. Gram has been secretly attracted to Kasey for a long time. Kasey likes Gram as well. but he can't come out to the public. Can one night of passion ever be anything more?Out of Bounds is a sweet romance with a lot of hot sex. Kasey is charming and Gram is sexy. They face prejudice and have to hide their relationship but they're stronger for it.  Out of Bounds is a good story.Nannettereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
3,"Just finished the second book &#8220;View To Kill&#8221; in this very sensational storyline. what can you say about characters that are so well written that they grab you from the beginning and not let go even after the story is finished.  This story maybe short but it is a joy to read. to devour and not want the story to end. the character of Sachin was terrific. he saved her. watched her as she matured into a fantastic women. and how he loves her. he definitely has a wonderful match in Paige. a perfect pair."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
2,"We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001.  I installed a bag and thought it worked OK.  (I did not throw the former bags. not Hoover bags. out.)  The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously.  My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference.  After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use.  I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured.  While not very scientific. it convinced us.  I have thrown the other bags away.Additional Comment:Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag. I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag.  This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house."
2,"This is a great. old-fashioned style of potato masher. which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood. What it has. though. that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design. with a comfortable handle. It also contains a hole at the top of the handle for hanging on a rack.This is excellent not only for potatoes. but for apples. carrots. various kinds of squash. turnips and other soft-cooked fruits and vegetables.The masher is made of durable stainless steel that helps you avoid rust."
4,"I hated it from the beginning to the end.  The plot was too predictable with very little surprises.  The lines were weak and uninspiring.  You come to a point where you literally want to see Jesus die so that the suffering would end for the viewer. Talk about flogging a theme. this one wins. palms down!Again I got caught up with the hype and controversy. regarding this film.  I made a promise to myself that this would be the last film that I shall purchase. before I see it first. so help me God!"
9,"I've been using Fireline in my beading projects for about eight years. and it works great for when you're using Swarovski crystals or beads that have sharp edges.The 6-pound count is nice for beads that are heavier and projects that have more weight to them.You just need to be really careful not to knot your projects; quite a few beading instructors have been warning that knots will break with this. and I've seen it happen when they demonstrate it.The smoke color will leave a grey residue on your fingers. but I rub it through a piece of Kleenex to take it off before I wax my thread. and have no problems.I was so happy to find this on Amazon since it's much cheaper to buy it here than from a beading store or beading website!"
3,"I got one book. for free from my libary (# 3) so at that time I did not even realize these were a series.  But I really enjoyed that one so I went back to start at the beginning with this book.  I don't think you have to read them in order. there is enough information that I did not feel lost reading them out of order.  I really liked the story of this first book. the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
7,"So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find yourself strung out.Black & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn Mower"
2,"I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot. I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet. I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
2,"This product is getting great reviews for good reason. Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First. freeze the bowl overnight. Second. chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla. not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things. I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream. which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things. I've found that I create milkshakes. and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly. the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly. and I'll experiment with those recipes."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
11,"I love popup books and interactive children's books. and have to admit: this is one of my favorites. It's not complex/intricate. but it has a very cute storyline which combines colors. animals. and an interactive ribbon. If kids could make their own books. I think this is the kind they would make. Brilliantly done! I love how each page reveals a new color being added to the rainbow. and that when you turn the last page it 'reloads' the book so it's ready to read again."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
3,"This book didn't really go the way I thought it would.  For one. I expected more action overall with the fact that Griffin is being hunted and I also didn't expect him to find out about Jarrah so quickly.  The dystopian society was a nice touch but I would have liked some more detail about it to make the backbone of the story a little stronger.  Overall I liked the story but. honestly. I think it would've been better if there had been more conflict; really the entire thing was just too EASY and that's a shame because I could see the potential for a more in depth story."
8,"After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy. Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing. Shouldn't this information be on the box if it's so important? I called the manufacturer and was 'serviced' by very argumentative representative. I don't think the product is worth the money at all. A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog. You are better off buying from Hartz. At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb."
5,"This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last. The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series. which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1.2.or 3. I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele. The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun. (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder)."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
11,"This game is laid out simply enough. all you need to do is collect the cards at the four corners and avoid turning into a zombie in the process. It takes some strategy though. 'Do I want this bonus or this one?' 'Do I go forward or double back?' The other cool thing is that your role in the game switches when you lose a battle to a zombie (roll a die and get a number less than the number on their card). Upon becoming Zombified. your new goal becomes making your teammates meet the same fate. Fantastic game. even cooler that it's based off the show."
3,"OK. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this 'free' book written in the 1800s.  I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics.  I had just received my Kindle and figured. what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down.  It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess.  This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future."
2,"I'll be honest; I don't get much exposure to a great variety of vegetable peelers. but I would hazard a guess that this is one of the best.I bought this based on the other good Amazon reviews and have not regretted it. Its sharp and very efficiently does its job.My sister came over for Christmas and after using it on a few dozen vegetables was so impressed that she went out the next day to find one of her own. I have a reputation in my family for buying the best of the best. no matter the cost. so she was very surprised to find this peeler was so cheap.Buy it. it just works."
2,"OXO designs great products and this is no exception.  It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.  I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much. I bought one for my aunt.Before this. I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher."
5,"I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar. and will soon replace them.  On quality control. the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it. two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected. but it looks bad.  On sound. these seemed okay at first. but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week. especially the high B and E steel strings. which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck. more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."
4,"This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever."
9,"got this for my savage fvsr .22lr .first yess the poi changes with the zoom . but you can figure that out and hold over ...on mills to compensate for poi moving...example-if u got zeroed at 9x and take it down to 6x same shott would be low.vise versa if you zeroed  on 6x ...so with the scope holding off on mils  still able to get decent 1.5 in groups at 150yrds with 22.lr and 3$ammo !! go to rimfirecentral.com to see many of the targets .yes the 9x is lil low on shooting  100yrd+ on paper but doable ...if they had a 500mm with 16x woulda been sweet"
3,"So. this book is long. and packed with lots of sex. The story is ok...but it seems to really just be background for sex scene after sex scene. To me. some of the descriptions of the sex went to the cheesey side of sex...rather than the erotic...but it was hot. And the description of his 'cannon' and use of it as a name...really?I guess I only gave it 3 stars because there really could have been more story here. I would have liked for it to have gone on in the end a little as to how it actually ended. To me. it just sorta stopped.So. If you are into hot and heavy steamy sex this is the book for you. If you want story with a side of steamy sex. this may be a bit much."
3,"Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com."
2,"I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.  I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM. 0.8 Sones. Energy Star Fan).  The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least). which I do.  They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.  And they shut-off the fans consistently.  No complaints.  I would purchase one of these again. if it ever failed."
8,"My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat (so take that Ogden Nash!).  She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys. especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty. you might try these."
5,"I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. I've never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic. it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If you're wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings. definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not. but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board."
2,"I love OXO utensils and have many of them.  But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher.  Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water. right?  The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum.  Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel.  It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils."
12,"This is my favorite Duke Nukem game. It's got a ton of levels to explore and the variety in the levels keeps things interesting. I played it when it first came out for the N64 and after beating it traded it. I got nostalgic for it so bought it again last year to play. What a great trip down memory lane. I was taken back to the first time I played it and it was just as fun. The graphics look even better on my 46' lcd than they ever did on my old tube tv. A great game for those who like older shooters with some humor."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."
5,"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example. I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em. use them daily. and rely on them !!!"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
5,"I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs. but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string. but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic. for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat. very pleased there as well."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"This product seemed to work for a couple of weeks at controlling fleas on our indoor dog who only goes out for exercise and to potty.  However one morning while combing her I noticed something stuck to her skin and much to my surprise it was a tick!  I thought it was very strange that the tick would be on her and still be alive considering that Frontline specifically states that it is for controlling both fleas and ticks.  Moving forward another month and it happened again - another tick.  This time I decided that this product just does not stand up to it's guarantee. nor does it work as advertised.  I will not buy again.Have since switched products. and have not experienced the same issue again."
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
2,"This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker. and it's never let me down.  Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home. when the ice cream is done. it will . . . still be soft. but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.'  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy. but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
3,"What do you get when you mix sci-fi and romance? Well if you're Cathryn Cade you get a compelling mix of the best of both genre's.In Tyger. Tyger Burning Bright we are introduced to the crew of the The Orion. the space ship version of a cruise ship. We meet some of the crew but this novel centers around the ships navigation officer Tyron Jag who goes through the mating shift while trying to navigate the new ship through an area of space that needs his expertise. We also meet Calla Fellura a novice crew member and the ships interpreter.The heat between Ty and Calla is intense. this is a total panty wringer. it is also amazingly well written with characters that are funny as well as sexy and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages and reaching for the next book. The world that has been created and the species that are developed are both fun and imaginative.While each novel is self contained it is best read in order so the sub plots in the novels are more understood."
9,"I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough. but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately. so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long. long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
9,"This Coleman stove has two 10.000 BTU burners that have independently adjustable flames that let you simultaneously boil water (on HIGH) or simmer (on LOW) whatever it is you desire. You can hook in a single propane cylinder tank that gives you 45 to 60 minutes on HIGH depending on your atmospheric conditions. This is a Coleman PerfectFlow stove that allows regulation of the propane pressure so some use and experimentation will get you desired results. It is a small unit. but it is very versatile and well-crafted. This Coleman stove has adjustable sides that allow for larger cookware and/or use to control temperature. Matches or such are needed to ignite the propane fueled flame. The bottom line on this unit is that it can really throw out heat and it is easily regulated."
3,"Can a woman from an abusive background find love and a lasting relationship. Apparently so. Can she find the love she needs in a menage a trois? Apparently so. Chris is able to overcome the trauma of being raised by an alcoholic abusive father and a mother who was completely submissive to him. Throw in a brother who has grown up to be just like the father and this poor girl has a lot to overcome. She did with the help of her lovers Jon and TJ. This is a short read can be done in one evening. While not out standing was entertaining. Chris is to be given a lot of credit for her strength in overcoming her horrible background."
7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"this game lacked the ability to live up to name 'Tomb Raider' its more of a 'City Raider' half the levels deal with city-time scenery. and 80% of the enemies are humans. more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities (Venice) so i cant complain too much - just wasnt feelin the whole China scene. I liked to level skip those. and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week. just run around and jump for the most part."
2,"I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.  I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.  This little 'mighty mite' packs a big punch.  Superb suction. compact and light weight. but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful. and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum."
12,"Okay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings. Some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get. And it has the exact same plot as every other Mario game. OMFG Bowser stole Peach whatever shall we do?! Get an ugly princess or something! And where the hell are the king and queen anyways?! The hats were also poorly implemented. The Flying cap is hard to use. the metal cap is rare. at best. and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap. They should have stuck to the 2D side scroller. And also where is Yoshi?! The fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustrating."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
4,"This movie does have entertainment value. and it is affordable enough to entertain some friends at home on a rainy day.  The video is grainy. almost 16mm like in appearance.  The music and sound effects during the fights scenes reminds me of the 60's campy hooded crimefighter shows. ZAP!  BOOM!  POW!  Holy Low budget Cinema! is what Jack Nicholsons trusty sidekick would say if he had one.  There is a story and it is ok.  Buy it for your collection. otherwise pass."
5,"Its OK. the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank. i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can't complain about it not being worth what i paid for it. i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive. more adjustable and just more versatile. would i buy this. yes if i didn't try anything else first. nuff said."
12,"I'm not a great fun of Microsoft but I have to admit that they did a great job with this joystick. just for once. I bought the Saitek Cyborg 3D. Same price. It was horrible. Unstable. It was cool looking but what's the use a  cool joystick when you can't land your plane with it because it sends  random signals to your pc? Sidewinder is precise and reliable.  Also it's  multipurpose. I use it for Falcon 4 and Need for Speed and it's great with  both."
2,"I'm a long time fan of Oxo products. but this isn't one of my favorites. Based on an earlier review. I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream. The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out (doesn'5t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I've tried it both ways). Furthermore. after about 6 months of use. the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop. and feels &quot;wobbly&quot;. It's also not all that easy to get clean. The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher doesn't do the job. It's going to be replaced - just don't know if it'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand.  I"
5,"One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings.  In my opinion they're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever.  I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less-expensive alternative.I certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars.  I've heard no other string that has the crisp. clean. rich sound of this brand of strings.  I've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand... but always come back to this one.Different diameter strings will sound significantly different. depending on the guitar you use.  I prefer this mid-range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone.  Any lighter and the guitar sounds 'tinny'. any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck.  These are 'just right'."
7,"Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed. I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old. thick branches.)"
12,"it was nice to see some of the greatest Nintendo characters come togeather in one game but all else form that this game is just to make your eyes sore!!! again i say these kinda games are for kids plain and simple.The game repetitive . annoying . trivial and of course my favorite definition meaningless to me. i felt that alot more could have been done to make this game a great classic. but only the characters can stand out!!!! nothing else. not even the game play. my little bro loves this game so i guess it's worth a play if you have an infantile intellects laterzzzz folks / gamers"
4,"Usually the first movie is the best one. and here it is true.  Ghidorah was always my favorie film in the Godzilla series.  We have some great monster battles. well detailed sets for destroying. and get to see Ghidorah with the meanness he's meant to have. only otherwise seen in Destroy all Monsters.  Both versions are very clean both visually and in audio.  The dubbed version is probably the one we all grew up seeing... with a lot of the added in music which. I feel. adds greatly to the film.  This is the copy all Godzilla fans ought to pick up."
8,"I've wanted to buy one of these fountains for my kitties for years.Last week it was one of the Deals on Amazon. so I splurged and bought a $25 gift for my kitties!They love it. I like having it there. it makes barely any noise. just a light trickle. The kitties love it. drink from it and play with the water stream.It's got a nice long cord. though I need an extension to put it where I want it. I like the on/off switch on the cord. and the water filter. It came with extra filters. at least a year's supply. Great value."
4,"I think it's great that the popularity of a recent film (Julie & Julia) has once again brought Julia Child into the spotlight.  When this series first aired in the mid 80's. I remember watching it to learn the essentials of food preparation and short cuts.  The very day I found out it was available. I immediately preordered.This two DVD set comes with an instructional booklet.  On the first. you will find Poultry. Meats and Vegetables.  On the second. Soups. Salads and Bread. Fish and Eggs. and First Courses and Desserts.  Both DVDs are well chaptered. so if you just want to watch one particular sub-chapter. you don't have to sift through an entire topic in order to do so.  As always. Julia is instructive. professional and completely enthusiastic.  Buy this now (together with the companion bookThe Way to Cook) and. if you haven't already. also get the newly releasedBaking With Julia"
4,"Robson Green and Michael Kitchen as two-thirds of a love triangle! I so enjoyed this production for so manyreasons. It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy. Well written. well acted. well designed. I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men. I bet if anyone asked her.she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career. I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent.Great fun."
7,"Since we live in the country. we have a lot of wildlife in our yard.  While they are cute to look at. they can do a lot of damage. and some of them don't smell very good(SKUNKS)!  We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer 'trimmed' all our shrubs. even the ones right next to the house. Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year. we didn't have that problem this past winter; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway. I love watching all the wildlife. and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden."
11,"I ordered this game because my two children. aged 7 and 12. love games and they also love Rudolph.The game is basically a combination board game/ dvd game.  The DVD shows some clips from the movie and the game action is in the form of moving your pieces on the board.The kids were excited to try it.  It was simple for them to understand and they seemed to enjoy playing.  However. they only played with it one time.  It's been a few weeks since they got it and they haven't gotten it out again.  This isn't typical of them since they enjoy playing games.  So. I assume that they didn't find it all that enjoyable.If you or your loved one is an avid fan of Rudolph. it might be worth purchasing.  If you are only a passing fan. then you may not get much pleasure from this game."
7,"I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake. but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps. but again. the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star. but I can't find a reason to even go for two."
11,"This book has always been a favorite in our household with our two daughters (now ages 3 and 6). They both grew up with this book and it made for a great introduction to numbers and counting. The book consists of little plastic monkey faces showing through holes in each page. As you turn each page. one face stays back on the previous page so that the count of monkeys goes down. The story flows with the decrease in monkey faces as they monkeys do something silly that they aren't supposed to do and fall off the bed... until there are none left. My 3 year old still chooses this book pretty regularly for her bedtime story even though she already knows her counting. She thinks it's a funny story and we regularly tell them to 'stop messing around on the beds so they don't fall off and bump their heads.' It is a great introduction to counting for your little ones. Highly Recommended!"
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
9,"I mounted this on my Henry lever action .22.  It fits the Henry. which is pre-grooved for rings. very nicely.  I didn't have to get new rings nor take off the iron sights. which was a big plus for me.I am not an expert on glasses so I won't (and can't) get too technical.  Lens very clear at all magnifications.  I was a little surprised nothing was included for 'clicking' the elevation/windage. but my pocket knife did the trick quite nicely anyway.  My local indoor range only goes to 50 yards and it took me about maybe 15 minutes to get it sighted in pretty close to what I wanted.  I was shooting dime sized 5-shot patterns in no time (from a sitting position. haven't done prone or off-hand yet).All in all. I doubt you can find a better bargain on Amazon than this guy if you need a cheap yet efficient rimfire scope.  100% recommended."
12,"I have always been a FF fan ever since 2 was out. I've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this. Let me tell you about the game:As you have probably found out from other reviews. it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc.. who is polluting the Earth. One of these members is a man named Cloud. a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier. which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles. they proved to be a challenge. Cloud. Sid. and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time. Espeically the 11 minute ending. Man that was good. ENJOY!"
11,"I bought this game for my 4 year old for his birthday.  We played it shortly after his birthday and he needed a little help when it was his turn.  He got a little frustrated the first time we played because he wanted to do it all by himself.  After playing this game a handful of times he needs very little help now.The game is fun for the adults in the house too.  It reminds me a little of dominos because you have to match future pieces with pieces previously played.  I think it is a little easier to play than dominos because there is a little less strategy involved.  However. it is still a super fun game.  I would recommend this game for a bright 4 year old. but be prepared to provide a little assistance.  A typical 5 or 6 year old should be able to play this game with little to no help.  This is a fun family game that everyone can play and enjoy!"
4,"Yes. it is I. the Edit Avenger!!Here to protect freedom and original art from plunderous corporations and soulless individuals!!!!If you are considering purchasing a 2004 or later release of 'Rudolph'. think twice. It is edited.I just ordered the original 2002 UNEDITED/no Destiny's Child 'Rudolph' DVD from eBay express. I got it sealed for $6.99 + $3 shipping.Do NOT buy edited DVDs when you can avoid it. Let's send the message. If you don't think that you make a difference remember this:Consumer complaints about the edits in 'Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge Collection Vol 1' were 100% of the reason that volumes 2 and 3 were released with absolutely NO edits whatsoever to the material.Good for us!Edits are for losers!I have spoken."
3,"Although this isn't the usual kind of read I expect when I think of Kallysten it's definitely got her touch.  I'm used to more erotic vs. sensual romance although this story lacks in the erotic it doesn't lack for emotion or conflict.Kate is an extremely strong female. Marc is a Vampire and Blake is his Childe.  The three make for amazing chemistry and witty banter.  From first meeting there is a spark and although Kate is put off by Blake's cocky attitude she's extremely intrigued by Marc and his relationship with Blake.  Kate has lived as a soldier for quite some time. she's bonded as a warrior with her fellow teammates. Marc and Blake bring the woman back out in her.  They all give one another a different perspective on why their fighting and exactly what their fighting for.I enjoyed this book and will definitely be finishing the trilogy. I can't wait to find out more about these characters."
9,"Dr. Bronner's Rose Castile Soap is really great stuff - while we haven't used it on our laundry for house cleaning purposes. we have used it for all sorts of personal care cleaning purposes. including to use to wash our hair. faces. and bodies.  I'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo. as it's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it's rosy scent. however. it's really nice to use as a face and body wash.  As a shampoo. it tends to dry out my hair a little too much. also.  As a face and body wash. I haven't noticed any effects of drying out my skin. and the scent is not strong enough to overpower. but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented.  The scent is not chemically or super girly smelling - my husband even likes using this soap!  Highly recommended."
11,"This is a very subjective review.The game system is pretty much the same as all the other Munchkin games.  Get to level 10. get the treasure. stab your buddy etc...The only reason for the lower than usual review is I'm not enamored with the genre. sort of like Munchkin bites. it's just not my kind of theme.  If outer space antics are your style then you will enjoy this game much more than I did.My son has Every verison of Munchkin (except blender) and this and Munchkin bites are the two I pass up whenever possible.The game likely deserves another star but I just don't enjoy it enough to give it."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
4,"Excellent film has many gripping and brilliantly realized scenes throughout.  I am sure many people are going to be divided about this film although I do not believe that it is anti-semitic in the slightest.  It will be very violent to some.  I thought that Gibson directed the film amazingly.  The acting by Jim Caviezel is astonishing.  Well shot cinematography and musical score.  But I can't say that it is the best religious film I have ever seen.  That title still belongs to 'Ben Hur'."
9,"Got this case for a projector I received that didn't come with its own case.  Pelican products are always very high quality and backed by a full warranty.  I received the case quickly and it was perfect for my needs.  The pluck and pull foam insert is very easy to use to make a custom fit for your equipment.  Took me less than 10 minutes to make separate cutouts for the projector. the cord and the remote.  (Useful tip - purchase a container of desiccant if you are going to store electronics or other sensitive equipment in this to absorb any moisture)"
8,"These are perfect for stuffing toys. like kongs and other types with smaller holes.I put round and square ones into my Aussie's large regularly shaped kong. and the biscuit-looking ones into my rat terrier's stuffable chew toys. She doesn't get the regularly shaped kong. because her jaw is smaller than the kong's opening. so she fishes the cookies out very easily. She gets other toys (from Petsmart) which are very tough as well. but have smaller openings. like KONG Stuff-A-Ball. It takes her over 20 minutes to get them out.  These cookies are much harder than regular biscuits. It takes her 5 minutes to get the regular biscuits and snaps out of any toy.my rat terrier is a very powerful chewer..."
7,"First of all. this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of. I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so. and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models. but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
3,"The events of 'Ylesia' take place during 'Destiny's Way.'  If you've read 'Destiny's Way.' you will see it mentioned in passing.Jaina and Jacen go to Ylesia to fight the Peace Brigade to show them that it's not good to align themselves with the enemy.  From there. it is page after page of battle scenes.  It is endless.  One huge chapter.  It's like the chapter that was cut out for good reason.'Ylesia' doesn't advance 'Destiny's Way' or 'The New Jedi Order' in any way that I could tell.  We don't learn anything new.  There is no insight.  If I had skipped it. I wouldn't have missed anything.If you don't mind reading in PDF. 'Ylesia' is available free from Del Rey.  If you Google. you'll see it linked to the Wayback machine and it's still there."
11,"This is a fun family game for Simpsons fans. It is more fun that other Scene It games I have played and was more enjoyable for the whole family. This is a good value since it's the Deluxe version for the same price as some stores sell the regular version. Some of the trivia questions are hard. but everyone has a chance to do well since many of the questions are based only on observations from the clips that are shown. This would be a great addition to a family game night collection as well as a welcome gift for a fan of The Simpsons."
7,"This product works as advertised. my tomatoes are doing very well.  However. it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered.  You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it.  I was having problems with it drying out quickly (granted. I live in New Mexico. where it is quite dry) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil.  I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top.  I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day.  The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom. dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs.  I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"I got this at a neighbor's recommendation and I am glad I did.  I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight.  This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste.  I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg. which deer and small rodents apparently don't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell. it is not overpowering and it does do the job.  This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a  motorized pupmp that runs on batteries.  It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray.  I would certainly recommend this.  It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
7,"I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook."
9,"This thing GOES.We get our best results from a determined onslaught to bend the ring DOWN on both sides. like a taco.  Hold it in place for a minute. and then the ring gets great lift and is easier to aim.  The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.This is great to keep in the car.  For my littlest son. we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close.  For bigger kids. they have plenty of time to run into position for cathcing the disk -- this thing floats for a long time.Watch out for trees.  And I guarantee you it will sail out of a normal suburban yard. so watch for cars. too."
8,"My family adopted a Golden Retriever who loves to fetch.  Problem is she's a slobbery mess. and I hated touching the balls.  I also can't throw very far when compared to how fast she runs. so games were short. and she wasn't exercising her full potential.Not any more!  I can probably throw the ball 250 feet now. and my dog is huffing and puffing in a few minutes!  I usually play with two balls. one she is fetching. and the other is ready to go when she comes back.  She wasn't very fond of the tennis ball that comes with the launcher. however I ordered some of the orange chuck-it balls and she's doing well with those.  You'll definitely need a large open area to use this though!Definitely worth the money."
2,"This is a great cordless vac. I have two dogs and this picks up all the hair without getting clogged! (works great on floors- medium success with carpet so if you have carpet this may not be your solution). I have an Electrolux that was specifically advertised to be good for people with dogs- what a waste of money- it clogs with the first pass- don't make the same mistake.  The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job.  It's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all."
9,"I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set based on the positive reviews I've read here on the product and the customer service. Fortunately I have not had to use the customer service. But the product is as advertised. I wanted to hold off on writing the review until I got to use the bands for a little while. I have been using it for my P90X workouts along with dumbbells and it has performed flawlessly. The quality of the bands are excellent and when you think about the cost it is a real bargain. Rarely does a product exceed my expectations but this one has. I highly recommend these bands."
7,"Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass. but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block."
5,"Dava picks are one of life's guilty little pleasures. They may seem pricey for picks. but they're still not that expensive. I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all gone.I use these to play slide. I also have Fender and Musician's Friend picks. but those are just the standard flat stamped-out pieces of plastic. The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control. And they just plain feel good to use. The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide. but with Dava you get a great grip."
2,"I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever.  However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough. but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to 'save money' and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings."
5,"This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized; at least you can have one place where you can find a pick. as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case. but a small baggie will work just as well. Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage? Sometimes (depending on the amount and size of the pick) it's hard to get the pick out of the holder. and if you use something other than the standard shape. forget it.  It has an adhesive backing. so I guess you can stick it on your amp/guitar/wall/small animal. but I'd rather not."
7,"I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days.  I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there. with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it. and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter. with a black. rich compost all around.Now mind you. I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot. dry heat this time of year.  I don't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July. By then this compost will be ready.  I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes.  I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly.  The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled.  Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff.  And that is a good sign."
3,"I had never read any of the old Classics so I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews.  It did start a little slow. but at the same time intriguing with the mystery of where the bullet came from.  At times I could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of the characters. and found it very interesting how they created things we take for granted today.  It's hard to remember that people used to have to do everything for themselves. it sure has been a lost art in the western society! I found the writing wonderful and Jules Verne painted wonderful details which made the story itself such a pleasure to read!"
3,"Okay so this book literally goes one paragraph in the present. then a flashback. present for a bit. flashback. It was so annoying. I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE. you are MARRIED. you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him. It was just a pathetic excuse for a book and really. writing in general."
3,"I've always like the Reader's Digest for a good blend of writing from humor to drama. having subscribed to the print version a number of times off and on over the years.  The actual content quality has always remained consistently high for this publication.It does seem the print version has become overloaded with ads. but that was less of a problem than the annoying cardboard insert/tear-out ads that make the thing physically difficult to read.The Kindle version is a very much improved experience over the print version. with the same high quality writing. of course.  A bonus is that the linked navigation makes it really easy to find an article for the mood I'm in at a given moment."
8,"For some odd reason I thought these were chewable. which clearly they're not. I'm not exactly how sure the dental part works in. I haven't noticed better breath or less tarter. It's a hard plastic toy. luckily for me my dog knows better than to eat the pieces she chews off. she just spits them out. If your dog isnt that way I wouldnt recommend as it could do inner damage or atleast monitor your dog. Im giving the product 4 stars because it did arrive earlier than expected. it does keep my dog entertained. shes more interested in chewing this toy than furniture. She seems happy with it so im happy."
8,"I thought this would be a little bigger. but that's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now. and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized. This is a great size for small-medium Dogs. It's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away! Haha. It's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers! As with any hard chew toy. do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they don't hurt a tooth. Ive heard that this can be a problem."
9,"Sorry. I'm just not a fan.  This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes. but I just couldn't get the hang of it with knives.  The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle.  The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you're trying to sharpen. rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks.  I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result."
2,"Needed a small. light duty. vacuum for our store.  After checking various reviews. purchased this item from Amazon.  It is compact. lightweight. has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag. which I prefer.  It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.  We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.  Three minor. non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism.  But. the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.  I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.  All. in all. this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive. convenient vacuum."
7,"This may look like a gimmick to you but it's not.  This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables.  All you need is a sunny place to hang it.  If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space. try this.  They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter.  Last summer I grew tomatoes. bell peppers and cucumbers in them.  I believe it needs to contain more soil (larger) to be an ideal tomato planter.  It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better.  One trick to know (not applicable for tomatoes)- take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy-- one in the top and one in the bottom."
7,"No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower can't reach. I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post. the street lamp post on my property. the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable. the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower can't handle.These shears are lightweight. are easy to use. cut the grass cleanly and. best of all. they let me stand up while using them. They do not require a battery. power cord. string or anything else besides a hand. Very handy. very useful and very good."
2,"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame. but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight."
2,"I bought this to clean up the bits of cat litter my cat tracks onto the bathroom floor  when he jumps out of his litter box.  For this it works stupendously.  I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held. but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power. and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus. tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time."
8,"WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing"
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
9,"This parachute is a lot of fun!  Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it. but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down.  He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction.This one is bigger than I thought it would be. which is a good thing. but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home.  If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around.  But if you have only 3 people to play with. while it still works. it's more fun with more people.  But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be!Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids!"
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
8,"I've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well. In fact. I purchased one for my mother's pets. I'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year. the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick. The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often. I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price. especially if you have to replace them more often. Check out the filters here on Amazon. you'll see I'm not the only one dissatisfied. Because of this. I am switching over to the Drinkwell system. I've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
7,"We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However. my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them. leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard."
7,"As soon as you put this in your hand you will kick yourself for not having bought it sooner.  Like many. I bought $1. $5. $7 nozzles that lasted all of one season.  They are just cheap junk.  We forget about how often we replace them because they are cheap at the time.  This particular model is their heavy duty. which should last though hot summers and cold winters.  It has brass components. a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions.  It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use.  A small depression of the handle gives you a gentle fan while a full depression gives you a powerful stream.  Compare this one with that cheapo you have now and you will clearly see the difference.  It is certainly money well spent."
12,"I would say the gameboy color was the best hand held game system I ever owned or play. Something that you grew up using will stick to you forever. I still play my gameboy evey now and then. playing games that never get old like pokemon. The only thing I ever had bad to say about the gameboy color was that it does not have a back light and I have to use a worm light. If you ever owned a gameboy in your life it's something that you always keep with you or end up buying another one like me."
8,"Frontline Plus is the only product I've used until present when we started using a multi-purpose Heart worm topical that includes some tic and flea protection.  Seems one still needs Frontline type protection anyway..Consider getting a syringe and small container (available on web) and splitting larger does Frontline over two or more applications.  I'd not be comfortable using one so large that it took more than two or three months to use it all - and keep the unused portion in a cool/dark place I have been told."
9,"I discovered Dr. Bronner's soap pin my local food co-op when I was a student- more years ago than I care to admit. I can only echo what others say: It's the perfect all around hand soap. bath soap and dish soap. I buy it in gallon jugs. attach a pump (available at any good hardware store) and transfer it into quart containers for the bath. pint containers for travel. and hand dispensers for the bathroom and kitchen sink. A gallon lasts close to a year in my household- just remember. as the Doctor says: Dilute! Dilute! Dilute! ;-)"
3,"I give it five stars.Unbreakable by Sydney Somers is a fantastic action filled story. in the tradition of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that I found almost impossible to put down. The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future. Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper. If you love stories about demons. heroes. hot sex and a great love that won't be denied then you are sure to love Unbreakable."
7,"I have a non-heavy-duty version of this hose. which has worked well for me for a year or so now. and I wanted another NeverKink. because these hoses seem to be flexible and easy to coil by hand. yet able to keep water flowing.This hose is quite a bit more rigid/inflexible than standard garden hoses and other NeverKink hoses. which makes winding the hose onto a hanger a little more difficult. and handling the hose a little more difficult in general. The hose does seem like it will stand up to a lot of use. though.My only major gripe is that the female end of the hose seems to have developed a leak already. after only a few weeks' use. seemingly at the point where the hose is crimped onto the brass fitting. I'll probably buy a replacement female connection from the home center and put it on."
11,"I got this game and tried it out on my family. They immediately loved it. even the family members who I'm usually hard-pressed to get to play. I bought most of the expansions that go with it that increase it from a max of 6 to 8 players. The game mechanics are very simple to teach. You will never play the same game twice with all the alien races you can be in the game and each of their own skills and abilities really change the strategy and game play of each game you play. I can't say enough good things about this game and I highly recommend it to anyone! This game has been around a long time and its gotten better with age seems like."
12,"DO not get me wrong.  I am one of The BIGGEST Zelda fans in the world. and I bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and  all.But this Just isn't a Zelda game....Its missing the Fancy tunes.  the story just doesn't seem that addictive.WHen you first get the game  its great and it looks to be one of the best games. but then after you beat  it.... its kinda boring...Zelda games should never get boring! Zelda NES  I STILL paly that damn game.' Link Not as good as the first but still I  like playing it. Zelda A Link To the pass on SNES is the BEST Zelda game.I just cannot love this game.. it did horrorble for a Zelda game."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"Ticket to Ride is a game my family and I have been able to play over and over and over again.  It's one of the best new games I've played in years.  I have the game. expansions and even the iPad version.  The classic physical board game is still my favorite with friends. but the digital version allows you to play against an AI pretty easily with no change in gameplay.If you know a computer scientist. math major or engineer. they will find the mathematical puzzle of solving the &#34;Shortest Path&#34; problem fascinating.A great gift for a friend or your family."
3,"This is it. the big kahuna of newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles. no emailing articles to a friend. no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So. if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
12,"My nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii. Once I purchased the game for him. we found out that the Wii controllers won't work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii. After doing a little research. I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card. Once we got both of those. the gamecube game that we bought finally worked! After playing the game for a bit while being &#34;tethered&#34; to the Wii system because of the cable for the controller. we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom. So we got these controller extension cables. He is happy!"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
5,"I've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. I've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to. Would recommend to any level of guitar player!"
8,"I have 2 Dachshunds and a cat and this fountain is perfect. Purchased a different fountain and it stopped working after a few days. This fountain got great reviews. that's the reason why I got it and I'm very pleased with it. My pets have no trouble drinking out of it and they have fresh water all of the time. I do empty the water out and wash the bowl twice a week to get out the junk that the dogs' leave from drinking. which I would do with any bowl. Other than that. I'm sold!"
7,"When I first opened the package. I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece. this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest. so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on. I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again. although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks."
9,"I compared this to a standard whistle (the ones with the &#34;pea&#34; inside).  This is louder. so in an emergency. this can be heard from farther away.  However. it takes a lot more air to blow it.  Therefore. if an emergency includes you being injured or weakened in some way. you might not get much sound out of it.My suggestion is to have one of these. but also have the traditional (easier to blow) whistle in your pack or emergency bag.  If you have the energy to blow this. do so. if you can only blow the other one. even though it isn't as loud. it may still save your life."
7,"I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22. 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
3,"I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself. I find they are an easy read; that is. beautifully written. engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous. not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact. many are free!!"
4,"As someone who has read a few books about the physical suffering Jesus went through. I was amazed at how real the physical events were portrayed in this movie; almost like Mel Gibson took a time machine and filmed the crucifixion as it took place.  Now if we could only build a time machine to send the critics back in time.Even non-JesusFreaks should admit this movie was filmed to perfection.Every actor was great.  Every scene captivating.  Every word. needed.  Not only was this a great movie. it is fact.  The most real FACT there has ever been.  The man (God) on that cross took those nails for all of us...even those that dare reject His sacrifice.  Buy this movie and share it with friends - believers and non-believers.God Bless!(...)"
8,"I found two young female cats wondering around my neighborhood and eventually caught them. their fur was rough and dirty from malnourishment and the harsh weather. After a bath and some good science diet cat food. they're as healthy as can be! Their fur is soft and their teeth are so healthy! I also leave a bowl of science diet cat food for the other two feral cats that don't want to be caught. I will not be taking my two new kitty cats off this food. they love it to much!"
3,"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to 'show' him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much."
8,"Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami. Florida. We have exterminated the yard. his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar.  We also used Rose Geranium oil. all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem.  Adult ticks and baby ticks.  It's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day."
5,"I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it's EQ. Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to &#34;bassy&#34;. and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little. I really didn't expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. If you're looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar. I'd recommend this."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
8,"I bought this product to supplement my Siberian husky&#8217;s home cooked diet that is supplemented with high quality kibble.  We have been adding Nupro to her 3 daily meals for nearly 2 months now and her coat is noticeably smoother & shinier.  Previously she had hotspots around her mouth from licking; Nupro has almost totally alleviated this.  Shockingly. she turned the powder down at first (we have read reviews that said dogs couldn&#8217;t refuse the smell/flavors) but now we mix the powder with water and top it onto her food and she can&#8217;t get enough.  This is a great product for anyone looking for a top quality dog food supplement."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
12,"Tomb Raider 3 is the hardest of the Tomb Raider series (at least in my opinion). It has a very complicated plot. decent graphics. and a moderate amount of action--although I have not completed it myself. It could use more action and less puzzles. however. The biggest problem with it that I've faced is that it has a lot of bugs and errors throughout. Some errors can be fixed without a lot of hassle. others can be fixed but with a lot of hassle. and some can't be fixed at all. Myself. I don't have a lot of patience. I just play the game because I love challenges. So. unless you have a LOT of patience. or enjoy tough challenges like I do. TR3 is not for you."
2,"This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff. and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife. wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives. you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest. least-attractive lemon twists ever. and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK. it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane. or maybe a different zester. but this one is a turd. Finally. the handle is not 'comfortable.' it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy."
11,"This is a fun game for players of all ages.  The board depicts a map of the United States (in this version; other versions exist for other locations) with train routes of appropriate lengths between major cities.  Players have tickets from one major city to another.  In order to get credit for that ticket. the player must build their train between those cities.  Combine routes to get points for more tickets.The game requires logic in that you need to plan your route appropriately; longer legs earn greater point values.A good time is had by all!"
2,"Bought for 3rd time in November 2012.  Due to misadventures in moving we have had to buy this exact product 3 times.  The grip stays in hand with no slipping even if hand gets wet while using.  Peels excellent with little pressure.  My gal friend has rheumatoid arthritis and this is the only style she can use.  Got stupid once and bought the Kitchen Aid red colored one just because of the color and regretted on 1st use - handle was uncomfortable. slippery. and blades would not peel properly.  The OXO is easy to use. easy to clean. very reliable product and company.  Amazon price slightly better than any other store we researched."
9,"I have a philosophy about my new commuting experience that can be summed up as visibility trumps cool.  If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night (I guess folks do that) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light.  Essentially. this will do.  The Bell light makes light and flashes.  I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road.  It is fairly cheap construction. but it shouldn't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work.  The light is inexpensive and it works.  If you are concerned with batteries and the environment. buy a generator light... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one."
8,"I didn't get what picture and ingredients showed.  So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog's treats.  They didn't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change. Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change.  So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed.  I may buy them again. I don't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good. My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them.  review from 2 stars to 5 stars."
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
9,"The knife itself is well made and comes nice and sharp out of the box. My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full-tang knife. and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt. The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it (the nylon model with the integrated multi-tool pouch) isn't really that great in my opinion. It's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi-tool there. but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it. so to each their own.That said. I have no qualms about my purchase and it's a solid. well-built knife that I anticipate will last me quite some time."
8,"I have been very happy with my Snuggle Safe heat pad. The claims of 10-12 hours of heat are true IF you insulate it a bit. OK. it cools off in 4 hours or so if you leave it sitting out. but under a blanket. it stays toasty for a good 10 hours (I don't think I have every checked it after 12 hours. but I expect it would still be a bit warm).Granted. my cats are not much interested (maybe they will be when the weather gets cold again). but I love it. I stick it at the foot of the bed (under the covers. so it stays warm). or even just hold it while I am reading in the evening.  I also got one for my Mom. who has Reynaud's Syndrome. and she says it is great. She just keeps it nearby and warms her hands as needed."
2,"The day I got this peeler. I compared how it peeled side by side with my other swivel potato peeler. just like an infomercial. or something. The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible. It takes no time at all to peel a potato. whereas I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before! I'm surprised that most swivel potato peelers don't have any kind of grip on the handle. because after any length of time. holding it can definitely be hard on your hand. It peels carrots equally well. and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun."
7,"I used this in Vietnam. where the local butcher. Hang Kau Pung. asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it. we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals."
1,"After reading the reviews. and recognizing the quality of OXO. I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease. and with this superb brush. the soap scum is gone. Good grief. what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow. coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush. which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip. wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces. from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14"
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
11,"Our weekly DnD group had a set-back tonight. so we grabbed a copy of this from the local Target store as a stand-in.  All of our guys were quite entertained by this game. and it served as a great temporary stand-in for a sorely missed DnD session.  I would highly rate this for a gaming group looking for an engaging and fun distraction.  The variety in the play of this game is excellent. and while it's easy to grasp. it isn't easy to win...especially with a group of gamer's that will 'stick it to you'. The backstabbing is quite fun. and most gamers would get a kick out of the humor.  Overall. a definite thumbs up for gamers out there!"
1,"I am the dishwasher in my home. and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush. and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one. and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well. is easy to keep from getting clogged. and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all. and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference."
9,"Yes D batteries can be expensive. but my name brand batteries seem to last a long time. Plus the ability to take it anywhere is a BIG plus. My pump works just great on the 4 in 1 Coleman mattress. Inflated both in under 2 minutes. Deflation even faster. Remember. sometimes you get a dud. try again. I got lucky and got a great pump at a great price. I have tried those aero type beds. and not for me. Uncomfortable. heavy. must have a plug near by to inflate. I'm spur of the moment. so this travel pump is just perfect! p.s. it's advertised as a 4D pump. so you know before you buy it takes D batteries. so if you don't want the weight by a bike pump!!"
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
1,"I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG. for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright."
8,"I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also. the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading. which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro. the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
8,"I recieved this fountain in the mail approximately 2 weeks. ago. so I will enter a new review later if my opinion changes...That said. this is a great fountain so far.  Fairly easy to assemble. extremely quiet (almost silent). and very easy to refill...you can leave it running. remove the water container. refill and replace without having to turn the unit off.That said. it is not the petmate 'deluxe' model..no in-line power switch. no flow adjustment valve... so. don't buy this if you are looking for those features.Only time will tell if the pump continues to work as silently and as quietly as it has so far. but as of now. this is a good purchase for the money...given the mistake in labeling it as 'deluxe'.  It is still at least $10.00 cheaper than the same model at my local pet chain store."
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
2,"I had never used a pressure cooker before but have been planning to buy one for a while. and decided to buy this one because it looks well made and has good reviews.I tried cooking several vegetables and some Sirloin tips (separately) and found the Sirloin surprisingly tender. the vegetables retained a lot more flavor.I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver. resulting in great tasting food!"
4,"Shiva Damienson has got it all wrong.  Every other movie about the New Testamont has been inacurate in their dipiction of Christ's crusifixtion.  If you've seen movies like Jesus of Nazereth and others from that era. than your eyes will be opened when you see this film.  If you consider the film to be overly violent than stay away from it. even if you are a Christian like me.  I am a Christian and was disturbed by the violence. but that was because it was commited against my savior: an inoccent man.  The movie is rated R for a reason. so this movie is not appropriate for a younger audience. but for anyone who has the stomach to handle it. than see it."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
12,"I was never a big fan of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre. but after giving Half-Life a try (thanks to all of the glimmering reviews). I am absolutely hooked. From the opening tram sequence. you're mesmerized by  Gordon Freeman's plight and the falling Black Mesa world surrounding him.  It's a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of  sunlight (apologies to my wife!). After dishing out punishment to those  Marines. be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes.  The fun gets even better. and the taste of death is even sweeter when you  blow apart that guy with 196 kills. Half-Life is truly a work of art.  Opposing Forces. here I come."
8,"I've had two of these fountains. and several family members also have them.  Yes. weird things happen. and at least one was returned to company with pump problems.  For whatever reason. they do not include the following information routinely in their packaging.  For a pdf that illustrates routine cleaning. and some FAQ's. go to: [...]  You need to take the pump apart and despite the instructions in pdf. use the pointed type q-tips. a wire cake tester. in-between-teeth cleaner brush(really). you get the idea. to clean it inside and out! My cats love this fountain. but we joke that one of them has a 'drinking problem.' because she likes to belly-up at front of fountain and drink from waterfall. resulting in a drenched bib.  The pdf should address many of the common complaints about this product.  Good luck!"
2,"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However. I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
9,"This is a beautifully constructed. solid tool. Being so it is on the heavy side. The only faults that I find with it are: the phillips head screwdriver blade is hard to remove and there are three slot head screwdriver blades. In this day and age it is rare to find a slot headed screw and rarer still to need three different blades. On the other hand. the one phillips headed screw driver is of an in-between size (size 1?). a larger or smaller one would be more useful. I have found that it works fairly well with larger Phillips head screws.The locking mechanism for the blades is positive and easy to remove.I agree that the snap closure on the holster is inadequate.If the combination that includes three flat screw driver blades works for you then this tool is nearly perfect."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
9,"I've taken this to work. outside. to the beach etc.  I can't get enough of this thing!  When it starts getting boring I put it away for a week or two then shoot the dog with it.  Since he can't see it coming he things something just jumped in front or above him!  I even hit my mother in law several times and she had no idea the &#34;thump&#34; was what was causing her hair to jump!!!!!  This is even fun for my 4 year old. she can pull it back enough to get a nice air slug out even though she can't pull it back all the way and still aim.  Great fun!!!!!!!!!!"
9,"I spent quite some time researching and trying to find a pocket knife that I liked that was made in the USA.  Unfortunately the information about that is very sketchy online.  This one doesn't say it anywhere. so I took a chance and got lucky that it had the Portland. OR stamp on the blade.  I have been using it for several months now and have absolutely no complaints about it.  I love the cut outs on the blade for one handed opening vs. the typical thumb posts.  It fits in my pocket very well and was extremely well sharpened when it arrived."
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
6,"What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain. cylindrical body. a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap. and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests. but they do put ink on paper. and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that. these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat."
3,"This was a fast paced tale.  It started off so innocently in the Holy Land with a pleasant trip with just a hint of something wrong.  Greg's  senses were picking up little nuances. but couldn't quite put a finger on what was bothering him.  Just too many coincidences.  After they got home. the fun started.  With Jill kidnapped he had to pull out all the stops and call in every favor he could.  As this is the beginning of the series. it made you think a little harder.  Loved the relationship and the genuine love between them.  A great read.  Recommend reading all this series."
4,"I started kickboxing with this video. only to find it too challenging.  Though Kathy instructs you on careful and precise movements and good posture. you are really better off going to a class first where someone not  only instructs you but checks that you are doing the moves correctly.  However. after learning how to do the moves correctly. this video is  excellent. though occasionally repetitive.  Kathy and her friend can be a  little bit annoying. but once you break a sweat. they are the last thing  you're thinking about!"
2,"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock. and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all. but I've really been craving sorbet. and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix. but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours. only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."
12,"This game had the potential to be great. but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with. as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game. If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games. or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations. than you just may be good to go. but you can easily take a lot of damage. and you can't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games. or Quake. If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you. then go ahead and play this. but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements. I think you are better off playing Doom 3. Silent Hill. the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3.These are my two cents."
1,"I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way.  I wasn't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed. but it sounded like the newer the scar is. the better it works.  Honestly. I've been using it for a few weeks (I try for once a day. but I occasionally forget) and the results are AMAZING.  It literally looks better every day.  The weird bump &#34;over scarring&#34; areas were gone after TWO days.  Now my scar had JUST healed.  I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone. so I suspect that's why I've had such great luck."
7,"It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring. including wasting three of the 'clean out' cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product."
8,"My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every 'durable' toy there is.  I got her the 'wolf' size Galileo and had to help her start it (it's slippery before they scratch it up) but now she loves it.  If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you!  It doesn't even seem to matter that it's not flavored (at least not to my knowledge).  I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones."
7,"Though I have several string trimmers. there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines. I'll be in big trouble. and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well. and though I only use them a few times a year. they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely."
2,"This coffee maker makes good coffee. but all the little parts. which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months. I couldn't get it out. even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off. when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also 'beeps' at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee. but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement."
4,"Well. the title explains it. The title is extremely pointless. Why? Why? Why? Why did Toho have to make such a stupid film???! There are some changes they should have made. First. aliens. Why aliens? It is waaaay to corny. Second. Ghidrah. Way did Toho make Ghidrah look like he was a drunken elf? Ghidrah didn't have to shake his legs. heads. and wings uncontrolably! And third. MAKE GODZILLA AND THE OTHER MONSTERS GOOD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've given this movie five stars if Godzilla wasn't good! That mistake made the rest of the Showa series dumb. In the later movies. Godzilla acts more like Barney than a giant monster."
1,"While there is nothing wrong with the product. I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages. I am not blaming the retailers. I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be &#34;eliminating&#34; competing generic offerings. especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents. That's $0.88! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid. but there was no better generic offerings. it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless. I don't have a &#34;good reason&#34; to return these (oh. I would. if I could. but it's not the seller's fault. so I don't want to make them take losses on S&H;). but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now."
7,"I sure do love having this set in my shed.  I've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively.  I've never used the hedge trimmer. so I can't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries. which is super handy for heavy work days.  The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time. Bonus.* Lightweight.  I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn.* A wall mount with hooks comes with the set. So. I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed. just like in the photo.* Durable. good B&D; quality.The only bummer I've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly.  So. don't dawdle when using the leaf blower."
3,"This is not my first time reading this collection. I have the paperback copies that I have kept over the years. It is a totally engrossing set of books. Maggie Shayne is one of my favorite paranormal authors. one that I can be sure when I pick up one of her books. I will enjoy it.Wings in the Night. Part 1 contains six wonderful tales about the creatures of the night known as vampires. I read that Maggie's line of vampire stories are the original ones. the ones that came before. You will see they are people just like you and me. You'll fall in love at least once. Maybe more.If you like paranormal romance. get this collection. You won't be disappointed. All I was disappointed in was that I couldn't give it more than five stars. I am looking forward to obtaining more of her books for the Kindle or Nook."
7,"I like the fact that Deer Off is all-natural or I wouldn't have used it.  It comes with a battery-operated sprayer that works fairly well and delivers a good stream.  I walked twice around my garden while spraying a steady stream of Deer off around the perimeter.  The sprayer should be flushed out with clean water after each use.The odor around my garden wasn't unpleasant to me.  An application is supposed to last for 90 days but long before 90 days I saw rabbits in the garden.  On the plus side I haven't seen any signs of deer in the garden. and they potentially eat a lot more than rabbits.So it's effectiveness is inconclusive but at least it doesn't hurt to try."
12,"Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man. are you guys even trying anymore?  I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh. you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics. horrible gameplay. sucky battle system. hard to understand. VERY difficult to get into it. too confusing. dumbxxx characters like cloud. hes the worst.(except sephiroth). sometimes too long of cutscenes. boring cutscenes. you can barely see their eyes &amp; mouth. etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million.I hate this game."
2,"This little Eureka vac works well for me to pick up cat litter. crumbs. and easily tackles quick clean ups on the hard surface floors around my home. It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces; I've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time. On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards. I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go. I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space. The beater brush setting can be on on or off. The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum. Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet."
9,"Speedo makes great goggles with great quality.  I usually buy a pair every year or two to replace older ones that I have scratched up and or stretched out...yes I have a big head.  :-)That said I figure I would try a pair of these.  True to form. they are perfect goggles and very high quality.  Not much else can be said.I rate them 5/5 but with a hint of CAUTION!If you are ok with wearing what seems like a pair of sunglasses under water..then these are for you.  They do in fact block sunlight and make the experience a bit better during the bright mid afternoon but they do darken things up quite a bit  Just a note....in the end its your choice."
7,"This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs. chicken. sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood. but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the 'best ribs in the universe' procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around."
4,"This movie will make you laugh til you cry. it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie. thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout. not breathing any life into the role.Other than that. loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!"
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
6,"Those of us who've used a i950 don't need to be told that they drink ink like... I don't know... like how a thirsty something drinks water. In my case. this has been a good incentive to think twice before I go to print anything. Now. this set is a true price break from what I was used to. I don't really need an 8-pack but I did get one once. by mistake and I had no problem with the i950. I just ended up with 2 extra cartridges.It's low price. free shipping... if this was a grocery item. I'd probably set it up as an Amazon subscription. If anyone is aware of a better deal anywhere - it's got to be genuine Canon ink - please leave a comment to this review and I will be more than grateful."
3,"Novella length urban fantasy along the lines of Butcher's Dresden.I like this authors style. It has such a devil may care attitude to it and that is exactly how he has written his main character. With the debonnaire flair of  an outcast gentleman and the sarcastic wit of a person who doesn't give a flying monkey what anyone says or thinks.A few minor errors. one being the use of the word reign instead of reins.Other than that this is quite an excellent read. just a shame it isn't a full length novel. Saying that though novellas often feel 'interrupted' for wont of a better word and this doesn't. it fits snugly and ends well. Like the first cup of coffee in the morning.It just feels right.AVP-UK"
9,"The AirZooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The AirZooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own. but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!"
11,"Without repeating what has already been said in other reviews. I simply want to add to the advice that this game is for hardcore Simpsons fans.  I thought I was one...until I played this game.  I have watched the Simpsons since the early 90's and have seen most episodes at least 4-5 times.  This game was still very difficult for me. I thought that I would be able to play it with my kids (10 and 5) who watch the Simpsons with me. but it was really to difficult for them. However. I enjoyed watching the clips and it's a great collectible for serious fans.  I also got it for a fantastic price on Amazon. so no regrets!"
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"For players who like a meaty game. Talisman will give you hours of fun time. A typical game can last over two hours and the rules are more complicated than Monopoly but it isn't hard to master. For a modest investment in learning the game. you can have many afternoons and evenings of fun with kids age 10 and up. great for adults getting together for a game night as well. We play with all adults. mixed kids and adults. and all games are fun.The large number of cards and races make for varied reply and the available expansions are well worth addeding for new races. cards and regions. There is a random component to the game but the focus is more on steady advancement of your character which favors good play over luck.For those who play RPGs. this game could be considered 'D&D; lite'. a good way to get a fantasy gaming fix in when you can't get your regular group together.Materials are sturdy and the game holds up to lots of use."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
11,"This ship is probably one of the most important ships for the rebel side in the game. and almost all competitive rebel squadron lists have at least one. in fact the world champion used two X-wings and two B-wings. It does come in the Core Set bu this expansion has some very nice cards that add to the lethality of the X-wing. Mostly the usefulness is the two named pilots Wedge and Garvin. both are good with Wedge being the more useful of the two. The upgrades are decent with the highlights being the Astromechs.Whether it comes from this expansion. the Core Set. or the Rebel Transport the X-wing is a good ship. but all come with the different pilots that make it a great ship and I recommend picking up this expansion especially if you want to fly rebels."
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
1,"I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span. from about 3 months to less than 2 months. not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one. but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great. it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!"
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
6,"The gel rest is comfortable.  However if you look at the picture closely. the pad is actually a bit thinner 4/3rd of the way to the left. I think the designer's ideal is to make the thickest part near the number pad on the right side..But the problem is that number pad is least used part of the keyboard. and when my hand rest on &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; key the right side gets a lot less coverage than the left side. and feel very unbalanced."
6,"I see too many negative comments. It's 5 bucks. How powerful of a book stand do you want for 5 bucks? No it doesn't lock. No it doesn't hold 2000 page dictionaries. However....Yes. it's 5 bucks....Yes. it holds a college books....Yes. it stays still (even without a lock!). Good stuff for 5 bucks. It holds a book.If you're thinking this will hold a large book. it won't. A large hardcover book. like a certification book. would have to be less than 400 pages to fit in here. The only way it would fit a large dictionary. as pictured. would be if you opened it to the middle page and never wanted to read any place else."
2,"I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go. I really like how fast it makes ice cream. I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out. Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl. So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream. The texture is just right when its finished. I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer. So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy"
11,"This is the Non-Deluxe Edition of the awesome game. Munchkin. It has all the same stuff as the Deluxe edition. save for the board. the figures. and the female/male cards. Although you can play without all those things. I would not suggest it as it gets very confusing very fast. The game is a bit difficult to master. but it is well worth your time and effort! The monsters are hilarious and the rules are obscure so indulge in some healthy arguments as you play. It's good practice for your next friendly facebook debate over the superiority of certain ice cream flavors as well as your stance on current gun control legislation.Bottom line: go get this and learn how to play it! It's worth your time. Heads-up. you'll need 3-6 players. so go make two friends before making your purchase. (SIDE NOTE: If you're having any trouble learning how to play. go watch TableTop on youtube.)"
4,"The film has it's own value. but some people underestimate the work by the team that made all of these films. todays CGI animation is great but the quality of such recent CGI hits in theatres wouldn't be there if this team never existed. The blazed the trail the same way Lewis and Clark blazed the trail across the united states and the work in all these films proves it because of how the stand the test of time. Besides. the cast of these films in beyond stellar they are legendary. Not &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF TTHE BOARD&#34; was in one along with other ledgends and if it's good for &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD&#34; it perfect for my household."
8,"My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets. and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer. and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover. paw print cover. and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was. so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on. but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
12,"When you first buy this game. you will need to give it time. Reading the  Manual first just might be alot of help. The game starts out in pause mode.  This gives you time to zone space for roads. residental &amp; commercial or  indutry zones. water pipes and electrical wires. It times take to know the  best way to zone RCIs. It's not easy and money can disappear fast so don't  go crazy zoning everything and destorying things. it will cost you. It sum  this review in one sentence. It takes time to build a perfect city so try  different approaches and eventually your get it right."
9,"It didn't clean my hands. which weren't very dirty in the first place and it ruined my hair.Maybe it's just me. but I tried one *drop* for washing my hair. Even pre-mixed it with warm water. No amount of rinsing could get it out of my hair. It left my hair all greasy/oily. My hair was cleaner before I put this horrid stuff in it!Had to re-wash a FEW times with regular shampoo to get it all out.Now I don't dare use it on anything else. It's awful. Sitting on a shelf collecting dust."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
9,"This SOG 'Flash II' pocket knife is an excellent 'every day' carry knife. While I personally prefer theGerber 22-47162 Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening Stainless Steel Fine Edge Knife. my son did not due to the weight so we found someone that was willing to trade the SOG for the Gerber. Here are my observations:Pros:+ Quality; this is a well made knife that will hold up to daily use quite well+ Speed; opens one-handed quite quickly+ Blade; comes razor sharp and holds an edge quite well+ Pock Clip; very sturdy. no worries at+ Positive Locks; this locks open/closed with a sliding buttonMisc:* Weight; this a very light knife compared to my other pocketknives. I prefer a little more heft but (as noted above) my son doesn't. so this is a matter of personal preferenceAn all around good knife at a reasonable price!Highly Recommended!CFH"
12,"Although the graphics arent as good as one would expect. the characters are very well done.  Espeically Sephiroth. he seems to be the very essence of evil with the tricks he pulls of in the game.  Many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the mini-battle game available in the Golden Saucer. also why didnt they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript?  This was probably to save money so Square wouldnt have to hire voice actors. Although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written story."
4,"I have to admit. I cried in the movie theater. at least twice. The guy next to my boyfriend wept like a repenting sinner. people cleared their noses and throats. They clasped their mouths.The brutal portrayal of Jesus's last 12 hours were gory. unhuman. bloody. tragic. and filled me with sorrow and love for him.It was an amazing movie. and the cast was perfect for it. A must see for anyone appreciating the deep topics.I think in a funny way. this hollywood production made me feel closer to God. it did not make me think any less of Jewish people. and it made me cry deeply when I got home. to let those emotions that I bottled up during the showtime. free.Go see it. I think everyone should."
12,"If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game. All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts. It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere. Even if this game was a buck it's so bad it couldn't even be a novelty. People who know this game might even make fun of you. Anyways I don't think there will ever be a good superman game it's sad."
8,"My kittens love this food and they certainly seem to be growing at healthy rate. My adult male cat doesn't really eat it but he's always preferred dry food so I buy this for the younger ones and their mother.  Mom and the litter were abandoned so I'm not sure what she was fed before but she seems to really like the food and its put some much needed weight on her. They seem to really like this flavor and the beef and chicken. Both are a bit smellier and oiler then the others but that's probably what they like."
7,"I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service; as a result. I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house.  I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it.  With this device. though. I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most.  You have not experienced convenience until you've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord. just a battery powered tool.  It is definitely not for large estates. but for simple short jobs. it is perfect."
8,"My box was definitely genuine because I bought it at Costco. Did NOT get rid of adult fleas and the infestation is as bad or worse as ever. I have to find something that works because my pets are miserable and the house has fleas now too. Too bad these medications are all becoming useless. They used to work so well. Does anyone know which one actually works nowadays. All these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds. I need something that works and is safe for my dog."
4,"We all know the story of Jesus Christ. He lived as a human and committed no sin. He was the perfect man. Because of this he was able to settle the debt we have built with our sins buy acting as a human sacrifice. This movie gives us a look at how his final hours may have transpired. It's very powerful and very upsetting.This is an incredible movie. It is passionate. as the title suggests. and very realistic. The acting is perfect and the message is timeless. Whether you believe that Jesus was the son of God or not. you can appreciate the passion and love he had for his fellow man. It's amazing to think that he endured what he did as a human. when he also possessed the power of God. If you can handle the brutality and emotional toll this film will take on you. I strongly recommend it. Be ye warned! It's extremely graphic and hard not to look away from at times."
12,"My favorite character is Sephiroth.He also makes an appearance in &quot;kingdom Hearts&quot; as the toughest boss in the game.(but i beat him!)Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mind-blowing game.Cloud is the main character of this game.He also makes an appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as 3 or 4 bosses.he's easy.The thing is.I couldn't even get past the mechanical scorpion!The game is just way too hard for me.But I beat it.The Sephiroth's are also Hard.If you're in for some action.buy this.Cloud is just such an amzig character.and so is Sephiroth.sincerly.kenny"
7,"After chasing food around the typical round metal & wood skewers for quite a while I decided to go on the hunt for a better skewer. and I found them! The 'flat vs round' design allows whatever food you have on them to stay in place so that everything cooks evenly. The point. although sharp is not overly so but still sharp enough to easily pierce raw meat and the 18' length gives you plenty of room to 'load em' down with goodies or space the food out whichever suits the food being grilled. The loop handle makes it easier to grasp the skewers with a mit or tongs.A previous reviewer mentioned the 18' length and I'll agree depending upon your grill this length may be a bit long and they may be a tad better 2' shorter [that reviewer just cut his to fit].I gave these skewers 5 stars as I don't anticipate having to find anything better for kabobs!"
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
8,"Current version of littermaid does not work well at all. The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it. The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original. The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version (on Amazon). It worked for six days and then died. It was replaced at no charge. The second one worked for six weeks and then died. I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase. So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product. This system forced me to give this product at least one star. I would give it -5 if I could."
6,"This is not of the same quality as the Kensington foot rest.  I now have both it and this one.It is a smaller version and does not have the same range of motion and comfortable gel foot pads.BUT. it is far cheaper.So in balancing the function versus the price it is a very acceptable solution to leg pain when working for prolonged periods at a computer desk.I was needing another foot rest at my L shaped computer desk but did not want to pay the high price of the Kensington model.When balancing the cost and usability of this foot rest I am pleased with my purchase.  It provides most of the same qualities of the more expensive options.  It is worth the price asked and I find it to be restful."
11,"I love having a stripped down version of the game for the kids or new players that get intimidated with how crazy the original can get with new rules and Creepers.  My kids love it and they don't need to read the cards as much as the pictures are fairly self-explanatory.  This might also make a good large expansion to throw in your original Fluxx game. though it might make some of it too easy and some of the new rules don't won't make sense unless you are playing with your family."
2,"Yes. upfront I'll say it's a little noisy. but that kind of goes with the territory.  Works perfectly. just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream. ice milk. bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients. I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it. but the quality is far superior to store bought. and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream."
1,"I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What's wrong with it?1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer. thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework. especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it's short. flimsy. & bends so easily. it doesn't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker. fluffier & stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself. and as such is totally useless. And. it shreds!I had read the poor reviews. and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
6,"Although I have had the opportunity to use other brands through the Vine program. I am still very pleased with the price and performance of the Avery brand of labels.  I have never had an issue with these labels smudging or jamming in my laser printer.  I use these not only for address labels. but also for frequently used notes on packages (e.g. Fragile) and to label file folder boxes as well.  The templates to use create the data for the labels are included with Microsoft Word and make easy work out of getting them printed properly."
8,"No matter how good the nutritional value is. or how good it smells. it's no good if the dog won't eat it. and mine won't.  I am SO disappointed.  I tried mixing it in warm water to make a gravy.  Smelled great.  He hated it.  I then tried heating the &#34;gravy&#34; to really mix the powder into the HOT water.  I let it cool.  Put it on his food.  Hated it.  Next I tried it dry. just sprinkled on top.  He hated that. too.  The good news is that my brother's Rottweiler loves it.  But he loves anything!  I wanted this supplement because I am concerned about my fussy eater.  Unfortunately. it didn't help ME. at all."
4,"Surprised this didn't make a bigger release and it's only available in limited quantities from Twilight Time. I bought this after hearing this movie was based on a novel by Dauphne Du Maurier who also wrote the classic &#34;Rebecca&#34;. This movie I found is almost just as good as Rebecca and is basically about a man bewitched by a mysterious woman. Performances from Richard Burton and Olivia De Havilland are great and it contains maginificent Oscar Nominated black and white cinematography and a haunting score by Franz Waxman. I recommend this movie to all movie buffs and you better hurry and get it before it goes out of print."
11,"The board consists of a map of the world in old parchment color tones. Once you setup the board with your character standees. other world gates. monsters. and clue tokens. you get a sense of the adventure you're about to embark on. If you can get behind the below. this game is perfect for your gaming group:- Cthulhu / Lovecraft enthusiasts. or Arkham Horror board game enthusiasts- A small amount of setup but thematic rules make it easy to learn how to play- No plastic miniatures and few dice. but a lot of cards which contain the meat of your adventure- Ultimately a storytelling game through card play and strategy discussion amongst the players- Lots of fun and immersive mechanisms in the game such as having your investigators go insane or defeated. fighting monsters. going to other worlds. encountering and dealing with personal conditions/setbacks. improving skills and gaining items and allies.- Long game of about 3 hours with 4 players and even longer with the full 8 player game"
2,"I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many. many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun. freezing winter. pouring rain. and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available. and the new one looks just like the old one. but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!"
2,"This is a great basic vacuum. It is great for my small apartment. I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood. I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off. My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose. That sliding mechanism is great. but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum. So. from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand. That said. i can always slap a piece of tape on that part. because otherwise this vac is so good. Suction is really great. Cant beat it for the price."
9,"I have discovered. through purchasing this pan to replace a different crepe pan. that I am crepe-handicapped. I tried. I really did to make beautiful crepes the likes of which I had in France all to no avail. Nothing to do with the pan and everything to do with me apparently. I do love this pan though. It is wonderful for pancakes and probably anything else you may want to cook. This is the lightest Lodge pan I own and it is so nice to work with. No hot spots. no cool spots just perfectly cooked pancakes that were made after my bitter dissapointment with the crepe batter. If you are not crepe-challenged (as I am) I highly recommend this pan. You cannot go wrong with lodge."
6,"I'm usually dissapointed in card makers but these are the best I have every used.  The paper looks much better right out of the box. works great in the printer. does not smear and most important gives you a photo-like image on the paper.They are a nice big size and come with their own envelopes (which is good since they are so big).  The images are really as good as premium photo paper when compared side by side.  They fold well. envelopes are good quality also.These might cost a little more than generic ones but well worth the price. cannot find one bad thing to say about them."
9,"Originally I had bought the Howard Leight Impact Sports electronic muffs but had to return them due to fit. I bought these to replace them and I really like them. The fit is really nice and they are comfortable. The noise cancellation works well too in outdoor and indoor ranges. I didn't find the battery compartment too difficult to get in to using a flat head screw driver. The negative thing I found was that the on/off button knob fell off when I first turned them on. Perhaps putting some locktite might help there."
11,"The game is great fun and has a different feel than most boardgames or euro-games out there. The first couple reviews were very thorough and they are accurate in their praise. If you like boardgames and you like Cthulhu. you will like this game. If you also like Lovecraft. you will LOVE this game. It is very horror based. and while the investigators can choose combat options. there is a lot going on that is pure horror based that has nothign at all to do with shooting things. Sure. as the keeper. I can summon all sorts of nasties to try to kill the crew. but its so much more gratifying to slowly drive them all insane and have them do the job for me! Very happy with the purchase."
9,"For pancakes. this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly. and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT. repeat. NOT to use any soap of any kind. sponge. steel wool pad. on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it. you can scrub the surface with a hot. clean water. handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning. pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap."
4,"Ben Carson was more then just a gifted surgeon. but a man who had drive and ambition within him that he did not even know he had.  His mother was a great influence in his life and it shows in this movie about Ben Carson's life.  If you really want to know what drives a man then you need to get the movie.  You will learn that what he said at the National Prayers Breakfast was real and that is why the media has since launched a campaign to keep him from advancing his philosophy on life."
9,"The issue I have with the CLUB CHAMP PUTT N' HAZZARD (sic) putting green is that every aspect of it feels cheaply made and likely to fall apart quickly. The back &#34;3D&#34; wrap-around uses Velcro and doesn't fit properly. It leaves gaps between the base and the wrap no matter how much I fiddled with it. The putting surface isn't bad at all. but needs a little ironing to lay flat. The ball return works well enough. The plastic cup. &#34;sand trap&#34; and &#34;water hazard&#34; are made of very thin plastic. Not durable at all. If you use this at your office. it will probably hold up. But if you have little kids like me. they'll destroy this thing pronto.Overall this putting green feels cheaply made. I'd look elsewhere."
2,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback. it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."
12,"I love this game.  I love this game.  I love this game.  I just got Ocarina of Time and it's been a few years since it has come out - it still rocks even in comparison to what's out now.  I've had a Playstation 2 for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there. but after playing Ocarina of Time. I realize that I had forgotten the beauty of Nintendo games.  They just have a special feel to them (and they make me remember the years that I was a little tike playing old Nintendo games).  I just beat the game about 5 minutes ago.  I certainly won't spoil anything. but I will tell you that the ending is over 30 seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see...  A video game hasn't brought me this level of satisfaction in a while.  Bravo Nintendo. bravo."
11,"The Programmer Rover was a huge hit for my boys. one 9 average student and the other 10 who is in  accelerated/challenge classes.The instructions for the rover come in a laminated spiral bound book. very good as it is needed to be referred to often for every programmable action and therefore be built to last. The instruction booklet is well illustrated. the written instructions were clear and my nine year old was able to program the easier beginner tasks without a problem.Our boys and their friends spend hours playing with and programming the rover.  The Smart Lab ReCon Rover has turned out to be both an educational and fun electronic 'toy'. well worth the money. A++"
6,"For me. I prefer the college ruled notebooks and paper because it just plain holds more info and the notebook last longer. This Mead is top notch quality that I use in different colors and write with different pens and pencils. The paper is of excellent quality so that whatever pen or pencil I choose. the page is highly readable with no smears.This notebook is suitable for any age from young students to senior adults. And I have found these notebooks I keep records in and love to use them next to my computer when I take notes from my computer research.This is a must have spiral notebook as in my opinion. Mead is the BEST ONE!"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
1,"It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often. The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them. no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem."
3,"Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover. Announcing it to her husband over breakfast probably wasn't the way to begin this adventure.Victoria Alexander has a way of making me laugh that no one else does! The antics of this husband and wife are truely hilarious. She really doesn't want a lover - just her husband's attention. He really doesn't want her to take a lover - but he offers to help. They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!"
2,"Without a doubt. this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift. but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).  It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.  Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.  Perhaps their freezers need adjusting?  In fact. after making ice cream (about 20 minutes) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking. so don't be afraid to try something innovative.  Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it. then improvise.We are healthy eaters.  It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.  It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!"
6,"I don't know how Avery continues to improve on products that seem to work so well. but they manage to find ways to tweak their labels to make them even easier to use.These labels work as promised - no jamming in my printer. the print is legible and clean. and the labels peel off like magic. I've used Avery products for years and I'm never disappointed. These labels are no exception. They zip out of my printer in a jiffy. and the labels are great to use on all sorts of packaging. I ship a lot of things in the craft bubble mailers. and these labels stick like a charm."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
4,"The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better .but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie. you might think it will be boring. so did I .but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics. then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace. the Power. the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel."
3,"These stories were just not on a par with the original. TWILIGHT PHANTASIES. and I was so disappointed.  Now this is just my take on this.  Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley.  I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me.  Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they don't have as many skills.  Also. they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright.  Just off somehow."
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
3,"I tried this book because I wanted something light and happy for this Christmas season.  I was very surprised to find it concerned an older hotel in San Francisco. one of my most favorite cities.  The heroine was a strong woman and she meets a man who is instantly attracted to her.  She is a little klutzy but all sorts of fun.  Personally. I can relate to that. I read this book I one short evening and think you'd enjoy this romance too.  If nothing else. it is a little different from the usual Contemporary Romance.  Happy Reading!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
3,"The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot. because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE. was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story. was the sex.  it was raw. very imaginative. and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story. in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99. at least this one was free. (ljb)"
2,"Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far. So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem. This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air. It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler. As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate. It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise. But for the price it does a good job. One thing however is that this fan scares my cats. It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review"
12,"Now u can have all of the classic games on ur ps1. It has many things to do on it unstead of just playing the original arcade game. What u can do is walk around the museum and look at all of the game rooms or just explore and see what is there. Each room that u walk in that is a game has a really cool movie clip before u play them. There is this one room that tells u all of the info about games and when they came out and how popular they were. Which is awsome to learn about it. The graphics in the museum r great for the ps1 but when u play the arcade games they got changed from the original by a tiny bit and the music is more clear. It has many of the classics that u can play single or multiplayer on which is fun. When u get this game dont think all there is is the arcade games in it. there is much more than that. It is an awsome game."
6,"These are the standard size/weight address labels. There's really not any way to make these exciting. but then again. do you really want excitement from an address label? These are exactly what you expect. and I have to say I really do prefer the name brand labels to the office store brands. They just seem to feed & stick more reliably.These feed easily in both the drawer and tray of my laser printer. peel cleanly (the non-label backing is already off the waxy paper. so removing them from the backing is super easy.I also really like that the label/template number is printed right on the label so you don't have to hunt down the package to generate the appropriate template. Finally. I like the box. It's sturdy corrugated with a flip-top lid so the lid won't go astray and the labels stay in the box. even if it's sideways on as shelf.Mine came with a sample of note tabs. a nice extra bonus."
4,"I watched The Passion at my church saturday night.  This was the second time.  The first was when it came out and it was a lot to take in.  This time it was different.  It was far more spiritual the second time - a year later.Being done in the language of the day is HUGE.  Both times I saw the movie I got the feeling that I was actually witnessing the day Christ was crucified.  Now when i see movies about Christ that are in English I have trouble connecting with them and somewhat even taking them seriously.I suggest that anyone. who thinks that Christ did not take on the sins of the world. should see this film with an open heart and mind."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
6,"This is an excellent product that makes an ordinarily tedious job much easier.  The trick is the 'Easy Apply label strips.' which allow you to print all five index tab labels at one time using a Word template that Avery makes available online.  Once they're printed. you just peel the group of labels off of the sheet and press the labels onto the folder tabs.  There's also a set of individual labels if you don't need sets of five.  It takes less time to do it than it takes to read this explanation.  The dividers themselves seem very sturdy. and they should survive pretty rough handling in a notebook.A new way of doing divider tab labels isn't going to change the world. but this Avery product makes life just a little easier.  Bottom line:  Well worth the money."
4,"I loved this movie. it would be a GREAT movie to show to a Youth group at church as I believe this movie teaches not only about Hosea. but it has a GREAT message about acceptance and how we all are going through things at one time or another and how we should not judge others because of their seemingly standoffishness.... (if this is a word).... I was shy as a young teen. and was going through things at home.... had no friends and I could relate to this girl..... thank you Beverly Patton"
9,"Meh...I bought these when a &#34;friend&#34; said they were better than the Howard Leights.  They're not.They do the same job. but complicate the issue.  Instead of one battery compartment (like the HL's). there are two. one in each ear.Rather than a single volume control. you now have one for each ear.  Great if you're a geriatric with varied hearing capacities in either ear. but just a nuisance when you want them both on the same volume anyways.Changing the batteries is a PITA!  Just a really disappointing design. to be honest.  I'd recommend the HL's over these 100% of the time.  Same price and better design."
2,"One messy African Grey together with a kibble-strewing canine in a kitchen where bread is baked 3-4 times a week was driving me nuts. I was so tired of schlepping out the Dyson 2-3 times a day to vacuum the above mentioned mess. The Eureka Quick Up Cordless is my new best friend. It was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger. The bonus battery pack ensures there is always plenty of power to get the job done. Because the Eureka Quick Up wasn't designed to suck the chrome off a truck's fender. don't expect it to take the place of a traditional vacuum. For those little messes that make you tired of dragging out and plugging in the big guns. the Eureka Quick Up is friggin' awesome!"
2,"LOVE this ice cream maker.  I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things. like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time. it seemed too easy. but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer. but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
1,"Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood. especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion. so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product. as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs."
3,"I very much enjoyed. It was sensual. and romantic.. Cal and Laurel were wonderfly done. I cheered for her through the entire story. A bit of mystery and a lost sole finding home. I could almost hear the wind in the trees. Miss Wildes painted such vivid pictures with her words.Will add Miss Wildes to my authors to watch.Storyline: outlaw romanceIntimacy: sensual. but not eroticEnjoyment: read with out stopping. did not want to stop for dinner.Book length: 41.000 wordsKindle length: na read in ePub format"
11,"I played this game once and was hooked! The rules are simple. You can modify it for kids. by. for example. not requiring their words to connect with each other. I like the speed. and in my family it's very social. True. during the game itself. you don't talk all that much--only groans of pain when you get a bad letter or get stuck and have to 'Dump' or wait for someone else to 'Peel.' Then there's the aftermath. where we critique each other's boards. make charges of cheating or bogus words. call each other 'Rotten Bananas.' etc.--all in great fun with lots of laughter. Scrabble can be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow--you could take a nap in a four person game while you await your turn. Takes about 10 minutes. max. This version of the game works for up to four people--for more than that I'd go for the double version. I love it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
11,"This unique game requires one player on his turn to come up with a word or phrase which describes a picture in their hand. It could be one word. a phrase or a sentence. The other players pick a card from their hand which they think matches that word or phrase. The pictures are fanastical and engaging. Selected cards are mixed and placed face up on he table. Players then vote on which picture they believe was the one who spoke the word or phrase. Points are awarded accordingly. The player who chose the word wants at least one person to pick their card. but not everyone. I highly recommend this game!"
6,"This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen. If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear. Granted. when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images. If you are not constantly printing. the nozzles will clog. It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer. After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer. I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000. My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable!"
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
1,"I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy. does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!"
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
2,"I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years. It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to.The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent. and it is made to last. High quality construction. great blade. and grate grip. and great price. What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet. they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower. sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find. but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time. your hands and wrist will feel the difference."
6,"These Avery labels are specially designed to coverup anything underneath them.  They call this TrueBlock. and if you want to be extra sure that nothing can be seen through the label you put on something then this is valuable.  If you don't need this then these labels would be an unnecessary expense in comparison to ordinary mailing labels.These labels are designed for laser printers. though you could also use them in an inkjet.  Just make sure you set the proper template in your word processor before printing.  These labels are something that I'll have available whenever I need to re-use a package/shipping envelope that has dark writing on it."
7,"Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
7,"I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house. and I love them.  They are practically indestructable. and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses. bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well. which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place. it can become very difficult to unscrew it."
3,"This is quite a bit different from Volume 1.  The first few stories were written from the perspective of the criminal committing the crime which was somewhat different.  But enter Dr. Thorndyke and justice is served.  The author is somewhat of a loquacios writer in that 10 or 20 words are used when 1 or none would do.  But he really does set the scene.  The authors of mysteries always need to create the  crimes and clues to match the expertise of esoteric knowledge of the protagonist but some of the these stories are over the top. However they are still very interesting and impart facts that I wasn't aware of.  They are extremely fun and interesting reads and I will continue to search for more like them."
12,"Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission. the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench. in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though. After you hit your target it just says 'Mission Complete' They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied."
7,"I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better. richer. darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well. I called the company and after a few passes around the office. I was told. then confirmed by another employee. that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So. they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose. but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer. mom. mage"
8,"My cats got infested with fleas and I had a hard time getting them under control. as a result I had many outbreaks of tapeworm in my three cats.  The vet bills got expensive after awhile. and since I had learned to identify tapeworm infection. with some research. I deemed these safe.  I am an infectious disease researcher myself. so I do have some experience.  These do work. BUT please ALWAYS check with the veterinarian FIRST before you try to self treat your pets.  The wrong treatment for the wrong diagnosis can lead to damaging consequences."
7,"Said to be drinking safe. this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season. OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems."
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
8,"I bought this product to stop the problem we were having with our 6 month old puppy. We have 5 little dogs that are paper trained. The product smells horrible to me. enough to make my stomach turn. I mixed it with canned food and all but one dog really loved it. I forced myself to tolerate the smell and continued to feed it to them for a couple of weeks once a day. It has helped to stop the problem even though one dog wouldn't eat it. I have stopped it for about a week now and it still seems to be working. I have my fingers crossed because I really don't want to smell it as I feed it anymore."
2,"Cutting bread without a bread knife is futile exercise. This bread knife works well and is very inexpensive. The blade is only about 8 inches. so it is not quite long enough to cut bread from a bread machine if the loaf is placed on its side.  I thought I had to get a longer knife. but then I figured I can stand the bread up so that it is much narrower.  That works. the knife is now long enough to cut very thin slices of bread that has about the same thickness as the Wonder sandwich bread that I used to buy in grocery stores."
9,"Kidding.  I've had the Classic SD for about 2 weeks now and am in love with it.  I bought it as a set along with the larger Tinker.  All tools function well.  My favorite is the toothpick.  The fingernale file comes in at a close second.  the little blade is sharp and workes well for its size.  This would be a usefull peice to add to a first aid kit. but this one travels in my pocket as my mini EDC.  Funny how quickly a small multi tool can become indespensible.  I rotate all my other blades. but this one is my constant companion.  Now if only they would add a corkscrew."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.What would the game be without Han & Chewie? The Falcon gives you these two characters as well as Lando and more. some extra abilities and a really nice. to-scale. model that you can also have fun with. 'Pew! Pew!' noises are an optional extra that you will have to supply yourself."
3,"Re-discovering all of Frank L Baum's 'Oz' books has been a hoot.  I read as many as I could get my hands on as a child; and so decided to check this one out on my new Kindel.  It's a lot of fun.  But no illustrations -- which are part of the fun of reading those books -- so that was a bit of a disappointment --  some misspelling and some dropped words from page to new page - but not so much that you cannot figure out what was supposed to be there.  I'd buy it in a hardcopy rather than Kindel edition. just to explore the illustrations (historical and fun in and of themselves)."
3,"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure. few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook. you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series. which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series. which includes Swords of Talera. Wings Over Talera. and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books. and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition."
1,"We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months)."
2,"Just received my Steamvac Jr. today and had pet stains waiting to be cleaned.  After they'd been around for a few weeks this little device didn't hold back the cleaning power.  Suction is awesome and I was so impressed I started to find things I wanted to clean...couch pillows. etc.  I just couldn't stop!  I'd recommend to anyone who's considering a handy. powerful tool of this nature.  (One note of caution...I didn't have the handles locked down all the way...my fault...and when lifting it off the counter after filling it up. it all hit the floor!!  Be aware of TWO locks. not one...)  It does come with a small bottle of cleaning agent which worked just fine but I purchased one separately anyway.  Enjoy!"
1,".Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day.  Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed. it drys my nasal membranes.  So I get frequent nosebleeds.  Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products.  I found that Ayr produces a gel. nose drops. and a mist.  I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful.  When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding.  My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds."
2,"... is home-made ice cream. I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess. quick. easy. home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks. too. including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction. powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve. but it's really true. if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours. it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this. because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice. but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
4,"Most Reliable biblical movie. The Gospel According to Matthew WORD-FOR-WORD is in the form of a movie. If a movie is not word-for-word it is not biblical. It is Hollywood. i.e. the Devil. Hollywood versus the Bible. You choose what you will feed your mind with. This is my favorite movie of all the &#34;biblical&#34; movies I have. Part 2 to Matthew is Acts. also by Visual Bible and also word-for-word. I give them out as gifts. They are less offensive to unbelievers and the religiously lazy who has never even read their Bible."
3,"I am a new Kindle user and downloaded my first issue of Reader's digest and was simply delighted with it!  I read it from cover to cover over a few days time which I have never done in the hard copy of the magazine.  I love that there are no ads and found it easy to navigate between the articles and features.  Thanks Kindle and Reader's digest!Its a few months later and I am updating that I still LOVE this magazine in Kindle format. I have seen a few people complain about not getting their back issues but I have no trouble at all with it. I had been off for a few weeks and when I returned I went to my Manage my Kindle on Amazon and there was a down arrow where I could select which issue I wanted to download so I selected both I had not read and voila! Both are on my Kindle now for me to read.  No problems at all.  Enjoy the magazine!"
3,"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie and since it was short. I read it in between other books in my TBR list. It was just okay on all counts - as erotica. it was passable; the plot wasn't exciting. but I did make it through to the end (although there wasn't really a burning need to); the characterization was okay - if the author had fleshed out her characters more. and improved the dialogue. it would've made a better book. There was some heat to it. and some of it was written pretty well. so that helped move the story along a little more than it would have otherwise. Since I did finish it to the end. and didn't hate it. I rated it as a 2.5. rounded up to 3."
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
4,"If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects. this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player. this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai. as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza. deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson. I have to say. has a very different personality. melodic approach. and technique from Vai and Satriani. but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."
1,"I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended. around twice a year.  I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections (which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday!).  AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex. Since I didn't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS.  It is significantly (25-30%) cheaper than AZO and works better (at least for me). For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs. Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior. The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering. it was wonderful."
1,"Its pretty good. its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals..."
6,"I can always depend on Avery to give me a quality product.  These little labels are what we use the most in our household.  They are handy for everything.  We use them with the free downloadable templates from their website so they are positioned accurately and look crisp and professional.  You can just print one or a whole sheet... and now the directions are right on the back of each sheet. very handy.  If you collect boxtops for education. they are cleary displayed in an area that can easily be cut out without disturbing the contents.No jamming. yet each individual label is easier to pick up without dislodging the outside border.  No problems.Highly recommended quality product."
4,"As I watch this movie for over the 50th time. have to laugh more and more. The movie is fun. yet have to wonder how Santa tolerated the elf and reindeer bullying. Reindeer tease poor Rudolf because of his nose. The elves tease poor Herbie because he doesn't want to make toys. and the head elf makes him work through his ten minute break. a true labor law violation.The Land of Misfit Toys is quite the site. can't help but to blame the elves for such mistakes. And why santa never knew about this place. since he knows everything and everyplace.The Abominable Snowman is more funny than scary. and is very entertaining.Always a classic and the flaws in the plot have holes bigger than the Grand Canyon. but that adds to the fun.A great way to enjoy a night by the fireplace with the family and friends."
11,"I recently wrote a review for the Forbidden Island board game.  In it. I said that I have been playing board games for a very long time and it is getting harder to find games that I can say are actually better than most of the games I have played before.  Forbidden Island was one of them that I would say that about and so is Ticket To Ride.  Like Forbidden Island. Ticket To Ride is very easy to learn and to teach how to play.  It will appeal to players of all ages.  You play as the owner of a railroad line and you are trying to fulfill contracts by placing trains on routes that connect cities all over a map of the United States.  The more contracts you can fulfill. the more victory points you can accumulate.  There are a lot of expansion sets released. with lots of new maps from all over the world and many more ways to play.  Ticket To Ride is a must have for any board game collection."
11,"This is a lovely puzzle. The image is fun and the pieces go together very well. The size is just right for little hands too! The box is great too - I opened the top flap and my daughter had fun putting the pieces away. The rope handle makes it easy for her to lug it around too.However. it's lower quality and more expensive than other brands such as Ravensburger. It's going to get beat up faster - the pieces were easily bent and just in shipping some of the pointier corners were bumped up."
12,"Sim City 3000 is really cool!  You start off by making a Power Plant(I prefer Fusion or Microvave).laying power lines.zoning Residentail.Commercail.and Industrial areas.disposing of garbage.Making Roads and/or a Mass Transit System.Make Water Structures and pipelines.and Take care of Civic needs.  Later in the game you might want to enact some ordinances(rules/laws).Make business deals with neighbors and organizations.set a budget(earlier on the computer does it for you).build rewards which most of them can only be optained thru Business Deals( ones optained without deal:county courthouse.Mayoral Mansion also know as you're house.city hall.performing of arts center.and Monument/statue. ones optained thru deal:Gigamall.Amusement Park.Space Port.Defense Contractor.Country Golf Club.etc.).  Plus you can add Landmarks to you're City.  This is a Great game.but for Sim City 2000 fans that want a totaly different game get the Unlimited Version(also known as Sim City 3000 Unlimited)."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
4,"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs. never the less. it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be. for the most part. some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film. with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram. the movie Joseph coming in a close second. and this movie. Moses. coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others. but the effort is exemplary."
6,"We have been using Scotch brand tape products for decades but not. until now. have we used this product. It is difficult to rate it because of infrequent need but on the one occasion we have used it thus far. it did all that we had hoped it would. If the item remains firmly attached after a month or so. I will add a star to my rating. Meanwhile. perhaps other uses will emerge. Tests and evaluations continue.Meanwhile. again. I say 'Thank You' to the Amazonians for the Vine Program."
3,"I have a version of 'Star by Star' that does not include the novella 'Recovery.' so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  'Recovery' tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in 'Balance Point.'  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship. it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out. like in the DVD's. where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it. but probably not to everyone."
9,"I am buying our third one for our third child.  This is a 'must have' for our kids between 18 months and 2 years.  The one we bought seven years ago is still going. albiet with a limp.  They have been used so much that the tires do wear out but the kids don't care!  The six and seven year olds still love their trikes as much as they do their two wheelers and they don't seem to notice that the wheels aren't round anymore.  Name one other toy you can buy for 25 bucks that lasts a kid from toddlerhood to first grade!"
12,"This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software. Then it did not have any voice sounds. Then it was running on windowed mode only. Now. everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer (BSoD).I give up. Codemasters. next time. dont rush a game out just because you have to. Test the game! If not for yourself for Colin himself. If he was alive he would be embarrassed.And don't buy the game using Steam because if it does not work. Steam will show you the finger :)"
9,"I love cooking with cast iron. This pan is great for making those 3 egg omlets. pancakes. fried eggs. etc. The low lip makes it easy to get the spatula under the eggs and flip them. On the down side if you fry bacon or sausages in it. the grease will spatter the stove. On a campfire that of course won't be a problem.However if you have limited space in your kitchen cabinet get the combo cooker. The lid is nearly as large as this one and you get the fry pan as well.On the plus side. this pan being thin fits right under the stack of cast iron pans I already own. So if you cook for a large family and want to serve everyone faster. this is a good way to go as an additional pan."
8,"I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats. That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house. I like blue. and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model. My cats still drink from this model. but it doesn't fit together as well as the deluxe model and. as a result. it often leaks. leaving puddles around it. If I purchase another. I will only get the Deluxe model."
3,"I'm not fairy tales redux. but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in one sitting. This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot.the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior. but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice. but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So. I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
3,"This book was a little slow in the beginning. but once the killing started. I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems. but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence. this book does not disappoint!"
1,"Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy. but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times). the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare. because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son. as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first. but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me. you want this product!"
1,"Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I've tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle. the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference. resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there. we're sticking with the Mach 3."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
9,"We've had a great time as a family throwing this around the soccer fields.  Luckily we have a large park area with enough space for 4 soccer fields all together cause this thing really flies.  Its soft so that it doesn't hurt if one of the small ones misses their catch.  The hole in the middle provides a good way for someone to get a grip or to catch it ring toss style.  Light and easy to throw for all ages.  Get one of these. and get out for some family disc time.  You will be glad that you did."
3,"...with a twist of goth and one seriously bad serial killer!This book really held my interest all the way through. but then the ending came and went in a flash.  With so much build up. I would have thought the ending would take longer to complete itself - not so.The detail given to describe the setting of each scene was incredible.  Also. you were provided deep insight into the characters. even the lesser ones.  There was nothing vague about this book.Formatting was off. but it wasn't too distracting after a while."
7,"I've put a lot of money and care into my landscaping and have had trouble preventing deer from eating much of it. so I thought I'd give this a try.Since applying this product I've seen deer in the area a few times. but they haven't even come into my yard.  To be fair. it hasn't rained since applying this. so I don't know how effective it would or how good a job I did with applying this to the underside of flowers and leaves.Really liked the electric applicator and the holster on the bottle.  It did take longer to prime than what I expected. but it was a breeze to use once it was primed.  Very easy on the hands.  Did get a little on myself when adjusting the spray and there is no evidence of an offensive order I've noticed when using other products.I will purchase this again in the future."
6,"We have been using this particular DryErase/Flip Chart outside of our store for 2 years now. We do not use it as an 'Easel.' but rather as a hanging board (where it hangs downward) to promote specials and products.After purchasing another product that didn't work. we were especially grateful to purchase this particular one. It is sturdy. and except in high winds. we do not have a problem with it blowing over. Best of all. we can write on both sides - either turning it sideways so it can be seen by cars / Pedestrians coming from either direction. or facing front. with the ability to turn it later in the day to promote a different sale (especially helpful for Thanksgiving day sales).As a small business owner. I appreciate the flexibility of being able to promote items without a lot of hassle. and this particular chart has been especially helpful to us."
2,"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker.  I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet.  I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl.  However. all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it.  The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim. it was a substantial amount.  Sadly. this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used."
1,"After years of having toe nails that grow oddly while at the same time toe nails that would turn almost black . I started using this medication. Even after a just-a few weeks I have noticed a great change and would not be without it. My toes nails re now growing with a distinctive clear color rather than black and they are beginning to take a normal shape instead of the one-fourth inch thick toe nail I used to have. It is still too early to tell if the medication is going to completely clear up the fungi. however it appears it is working quite well."
1,"This is by far the best product...ever...for Urinary Infections.  Better than anything you can have prescribed by a Doctor.  I did a lot of research about Cystex before I even ordered it.This is a very cleaver product...each tablet contains 1/2 of a normal aspirin. which acts against the immediate pain. and another ingredient that creates a chemical reaction in the kidneys and bladder and kills the bacteria and cures the problem.  I am a very allergic person and afraid to take any medication. but this is a dream come true for me.  Don't expect it to work in minutes. but all of a sudden...in a few hours...you will feel pain free.  The bottle says dose is 2 Tablets every eight hours. but I only take one every eight hours for two days and it's just great.  This is a staple for every medicine cabinet."
6,"Scotch continues their tradition of top quality products withScotch Gift Wrap Tape. 3/4 inch. 3 rolls. With its semigloss (or satin as they call it) finish. the tape looks very nice on gifts and it's hardly noticeable. While it might not actually disappear on the paper. I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. However. my one problem is the amount of tape on the dispenser. which is rather measly in comparison to a regular roll of Scotch tape. I'd rather get more tape. even if it means paying more. so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll. and there would be far less waste. Altogether. the tape is nice and the price seems fair."
8,"Please note that though my dogs are capable of ripping this or any fabric toy to shreds. for reasons only known to them. they don't do this. (a Big Retriever Mix & a giant Great Pyrenees mix). This squeaky duck is their favorite for fetch and the toy each consistently chooses to initiate a few rounds of big dog wrestle-rumble. The squeaker holds up to a lot of use and this toy does just fine when run through the washer & dryer. if you find your pup or pups tend to &#34;suck&#34; their stuffed animals and thus render them totally funky."
6,"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great.  I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily.  Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast.  I bought a generic memory card for $8.  The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.  Toner prices. even when you eventually need to replace the drum. are still about the cheapest of any laser."
12,"'Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back' was a large step up from the first part. This game's graphics. music. gameplay. and even story were much better than in the first. But it's kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot doesn't end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister. Coco Bandicoot. Well. at least Coco has the ability to speak. unlike her big brother.The voice acting changed dramatically as well. and for the better(Dr. Neo Cortex's new voice was much cooler and evil-sounding). If you liked the first Crash game. get this one. Although it's more difficult(especially in gathering Crystals and Gems). it's really fun!"
6,"My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall. This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding. Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces. Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks. which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. I note two things that partially excuse this: the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture's placement was near a heat vent. This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product. but that isn't saying much."
4,"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms. the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top. but with little kids. they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.For kids who avoid counting. this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's &quot;good for them&quot;!"
7,"I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year. I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time. finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision. Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me. We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time. we cooked a lot of meat. pepper. corn and etc. it was awesome. We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it. it's gonna get a lot more use this summer."
7,"After testing 4 areas of soil and a couple of control tests. none of these test results could be trusted.1. Tested lemon juice fresh from a lemon: pH read '6'... when it should have been the lowest value on the chart or more (pH of nearly 2 is lemon. so these tests give unreliably 'alkaline' results). The purified water test also came out 'alkaline'.  All of the yard samples also came up as the most alkaline result. 7.5.2. Tested freshly decomposed manure compost exactly to the package directions: none of the K. P. or N tests reacted at all after 10 minutes. 20. 30... or even 24 hours later. Manure compost should at least read 'adequate' for nitrogen! None of the soil samples from the yard reacted either. so the indicating agent in the capsules is useless.So. all in all. it was a tremendous waste of money and time."
2,"This is an awesome little machine for the money. Yea... The plastic is a little cheap and it is a little loud but you cannot beat the price or the power. It is perfect for hard surface floors. No it does not leave marks on wood floors. If you drag the cord under the wheels you'll get a mark from the wax on the cord but most people with a hint of intelligence should know better. No the canister does not easily tip over. I honestly don't know where some of these silly reviews are coming from. This is a great little vacuum for the price. If you want perfect go spend two hundred dollars."
6,"Another effective Avery office product that's relatively easy to use. Works fine with our home(Panasonic) and office(HP) laser printers (I didn't bother trying the labels with our ink-jet printers).  Avery provides FREE templates for Microsoft Word and also their own Design and Print Online.  It was easy to print out address labels for our clients.  Just make sure the printing is aligned properly with the labels.  The Pop-up Edge feature ensures effortles peeling of the labels.  There were no smudging.  Avery has kept it simple and useful."
8,"After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues. I'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew.  I even tried coating it with yummy stuff (peanut butter. etc.) to get my dogs to take interest. but they'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew.  My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd. Rottweiler. Pit Bull. and Border Collie. so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item.  I'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year.  It's going in the trash."
9,"What I like:Aesthetically pleasing to look at. handle and use.  The stainless steel is very appealing. and holds a nice shine.  The tools opening and locking have a very substantial. visceral click.  The curve of the plyer handles are very comfortable.It comes with a very nice. light-weight nylon SNAP pouch (I hate the velcro ones).It's lighter in weight than a Leatherman Surge. which is what I carried for the past ten years.What I dislike:Nothing.  I'm willing to sacrifice one-handed blade deployment for what I consider an aesthetically superior MT."
2,"Awesome product... just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid... leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.  Also. you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.  My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.  Other than that. its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.  If you really like ice cream or have a large family. you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.  The ice cream will go fast!"
7,"I have an old mallow bush that has had a white fly infestation every year beginning in the spring and running into November.  It is the only place in my yard where whiteflies have been a problem. Because the honey bees love the mallow flowers. I have not wanted to use a systemic or spray with harsh chemicals so the white flies have been right at home there for ten years or so.  In early March this year I placed about a half bag of earthworm castings on the ground under the mallow. spreading them several feet on all sides of the bush.  To my delight and surprise - no white flies on the mallow or surrounding area this year. They've moved away from my yard.  The honey bees are not at all turned off by the castings and continue to enjoy the flowers.  Now that I've seen how well they work. I will never again be without a supply of earthworm castings.  I can't believe I didn't know about their benefits earlier in my gardening adventures."
6,"Overall these are very good labels and my complaint doesn't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once. but I do.  With the easy peel labels the sheet tends to get stuck a little more in the printer then before. but it's not a ton.  And I reuse sheets because really. I'm not wasting a whole sheet for 2 or 3 addresses!  Besides that I've never had a problem with these labels smudging or not sticking. I've always been pleased with Avery labels."
12,"I own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made. I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges. Some good things about it is that this is the only Spyro game where you free the dragons. In the rest of the games. you help other people... It is funny and very interesting. ( Sorry. but I won't give the funny parts away. )The disadvanges is that you can't swim. In the other to games you can but in this game. if you touch the water you will die!!Another bad thing is that they don't have the cute characters like the other two games. I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1. I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line. I even think Spyro has a better voice. If you like all three Spyro's. try buying the Spyro pack. It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly. Then you can decide which one is better!!"
3,"This story is the beginning to a series and I really enjoyed it. The price point is about right for these short little stories so don't expect too much as this is very short. Dana Marie Bell has a new fan in me as the story moves right along. isn't too out there and I loved the domineering little Emma and how Max responds to her before even seeing her again. I thought the 'marking' her was a little abrupt. but I can look past that by saying that A) this is about shapeshifters and B)An Alpha gets what he wants when he wants it.Buy. Read. Enjoy."
1,"I originally got this for my daughter's leapfrog leap pad. She was going through batteries every couple of days. so rather than go broke buying batteries. I got these along with theEnergizer Value Charger with AA Rechargeable Batteries. 4 Batteries Included. which gives us a set to put in her leap pad. and a set to keep on the charger charged.  It charges well. and is always ready when I need to swap them out. It is definite woth the money. especially if you go through a lot of batteries."
4,"This is a sweet story. about a poor little drummer boy who can only offer a gift of song to the baby Jesus. Even toddlers are quick to notice the stop-action animation and the distinctive soundtrack that was recorded by the Vienna Boys Choir. Our toddler called it 'Camel' as he loved to see the dancing animals which of course included a dancing Camel.The cast features voices you will recognize;Jos&eacute; Ferrer  - Ben Haramed [Voice]The Vienna Boys ChoirPaul H. Frees  - [Voice]Greer Garson  - Storyteller [Voice]Ted Eccles  - [Voice]Jules Bass ad Arthur Rankin. Jr.  - Directed. Produced. and wrote this christmas classic.BOTTOM LINE: A Christmas Classic for the whole family that never wears out!"
4,"Others who are more knowledgable than I have reviewed the content of this disk and I agree with them for the most part. Let me address the technical issues.  First the picture is mediocre at best.  This is a video source from several years back and it shows.  Things get lost in the blacks and the picture is very soft.  Second. the surround tracks are very disorienting with the voices occasionally issuing from the rear speakers for no reason that i can determine.  I would love to see these companies start putting out disks that at least SOMEWHAT live up to the capabilities of the format."
12,"People seem to forget the number one reason Final Fantasy 7 is loved so fondly and remembered all these years later- it was one of the first video games able to tell a story that MILLIONS of people cared about.  In fact. it's probably the first RPG to ever tell such an incredible story.  It was also groundbreaking back in the day having extremely-realistic cutscenes featured. along with a quest that carried over 3 discs.  That's why the game is remembered.However. I have no idea why the price for the game jumped up to almost 70 bucks these days.  I guess because everyone who owns the game refuses to give up their copy."
11,"We've become board-book experts (snobs?!) over the last ten months. This is by far one of the nicer 'touch and feel' varities out there. The feeley spots are large and visible for young babies and there is a nice variety of textures: terry cloth towel. sand paper. faux grass. deep shaggy fleece. silk leaves that crinkle. short fuzzy fleece. The pages are stiff ad sturdy. the spine/binding is well made. Colors are bright and photos are pretty. Our 10-month-old daughter loves this book! (...Now. if only it had 'lift and look' flaps too. it would be perfect!)"
6,"Outside of being able to attach this to your car's rim and use it as a tire. this calculator does about everything.  And. for a reasonable price!  This is the required calculator for the 6th grade here in Ohio. but I originally purchased mine for an advanced chemistry class for a top 10 university course 18 years ago.  It's still the one I grab every time I need a calculator - it performs all the scientific notation that I need. and doesn't become cumbersome like the TI-83.  I've used this for everything from calculus. microbiology. biochemistry to advanced chemistry and it's worked like a dream.  For the price. it just cannot be beat and durability. well that speaks for itself.  Highly. highly recommend!"
12,"I was looking for a racing video game for my new playstation. and everyone I talked to told me to get Gran Turismo.  And now I know why.  It's so fun!  It's challenging. but not impossible.  The graphics are good and realistic. and there are tons of cars to choose from.  I really like the simulation mode where you can race for money and buy new cars or upgrade old ones.  I'm a huge fan of my Dodge Viper with racing stripes.One thing that's not so great about this game is the space that it takes up on your memory card.  Just to have a simulation mode game going. you need 5 empty blocks.  If you want to get into saving replays and stuff. it can use up to 15 blocks.  Memory cards are expensive... I'm not willing to devote an entire memory card to one game. no matter how great it is."
9,"This is a great pre-seasoned griddle. I make perfect pancakes and crepes everytime.  I usually add a teaspoon of vegetable oil before cooking to keep the surface extra slick although I probably don't need to.  Making crepes is as easy as making soup from a can.  Be aware that the handle gets hot so keep an oven mitt close by and follow the cleaning instructions. you don't wash this with soap or stick it in the dishwasher. This is one of the few lifetime purchases you can get for under 20 bucks.  So cheap I'm going to buy another one."
1,"If your going to try it and it has a applicator brush in it too . I bought the pen and it lasted about 6 weeks . Tea tree oil is really the best stuff . I am making some progress using both and planning to try kerasil or the vics vapo rub next if this doesn't clear it up after 6 months . It cleaned my little toes quick but my big toes just won't clear up . They look better but stay yellow - not gross anymore but slight greenish yellow . Getting old is no fun and either is using a dirty shower in a truck stop . Been paying for one slip in doing that for 25 years now but I treat it daily and know I won't do the same to someone else ."
3,"This captures the essence of the Holocaust but is filled with the bitterness for the Polish people. As a descendant of several Polish people who were killed by the Nazis for hiding numerous Jewish people during WWII. I feel that the author has unfairly portrayed the entire Polish race. Having grown up knowing three Jewish people that members of my family died to save. I take particular offense to this attitude. I know the author suffered unspeakable horrors during the Holocaust. but not all Polish people are evil. I only wish I could speak with Mr. Milder to let him know how perhaps someone he knew was perhaps saved by someone I lost."
12,"Final Fantasy 7 is the best FF I have yet to play.  I have played 8 and 9 also. but 7 has the best music. battle system. and junctioning system of all of them (not to mention the greatest story-line in the history of everything!).  Besides a couple of translation errors. this game is perfect.  I was introduced to Final Fantasy 7. 3 years ago. and I still do not know many things about it. So if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you. but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it. you should buy this game. and before they stop selling it."
7,"Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away. Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked. Since then. the other three started leaking also. Don't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months. but I am going to try. I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years. Somebody 'improved' them.Update: I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever. Havn't received them yet. so I don't know how these will perform."
11,"This is a nice colourful puzzle. with a simple design for youngsters 2 years and up - probably to about 4 or 5 years. The 25 pieces are big; each is about 4' x 4'. What is good is that the top edge of each puzzle piece is slightly rounded on the edges. which will help keep the picture from peeling away. However the pieces. themselves could be thicker. so that young hands would not be able to bend them so easily.The box is relatively solid and with care will last. Although. the cardboard `catch' to keep it closed starts to show signs of wear after a few uses. The cord is soft and makes it easy to carry the puzzle box.It does seem a bit pricey at this time. for such a simple puzzle."
4,"Dr. Satan. you seem to think you know Mel's motivations. I think you're speaking through your jaded perceptions. When Mel started work on this film. he ponied up his own money. He didn't even have a distributor for the film. but he went on with the production. He filmed a movie in two dead languages. He has spent another $10 million of his own money to build a church building in his hometown. His actions show him to be a devout man.If he were only concerned with profit he could have churned out another Lethal Weapon movie. His films and him personally have already made a mint.I saw The Last Temptation of Christ. aside from the final sequence when He comes off of the cross. the movie not very risky."
11,"I bought this to have while my grandchildren were here. They arrived several days before Christmas. They chose to name him Scottie. after Poppy who's middle name is Scott. Every morning he would show up in a new place ;-) As soon as they woke up they would begin their search for Scottie. Since he loses his magic if he's touched. I would place him out of reach to remove the temptation to test that theory. lol. We all had so much fun with Scottie that I am looking forward to his return from the North Pole next year. Your Elf will come with a book to read to the children which explains his presence and purpose."
3,"I see that some people did not rate this high.  'BUT' I have read the whole series.  This series is about 6 women who met in college and became fast friends.  They have nothing in common.  You really need to read the entire series to find out why they were pulled to each other.  I have read the entire series 3 times.  I loved it.  There are 6 Vamps too.  They have all been friends for thousands of years.Each book bings in new characters and of course keeps the former characters too.These books are full of action. adventure. 'SEX' and strong women and men.'WARNING' These books are 'R' rated.  No 'holes' barred in this series.  LOL!!!!!!!LOVE MY VAMPS/SHIFTERS/STRONG WOMEN/AND BEASTS OF MEN.  LOL!!!"
4,"I needed strong drink to wash my mouth out after sitting through POTC. the most distasteful film I've ever seen.  The only benefit from watching it was the sense of duty to warn others off. Like incinerating an insect under a magnifying glass. Gibson accentuates a few verses in the story of the last week of Jesus into a gruesome. disgusting. gratuitous gorefest.  Maybe it helps one's appreciation to believe that Jesus died for our sins (which I don't). but even in that case. I don't think that Gibson's relentless portrayal of violence adds much to the magic."
7,"This stove top smoker is one of the best products I have ever used (and I use it often).  I have had this thing for about 5 or 6 years now.  It is as good as the day I bought it.  I smoke chicken and ribs mainly but you can smoke just about anything that you could in a regular smoker (just not as much in terms of amount).  It is easy to clean and the wood chips are reasonable in price.  You only use about a teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on what you are smoking.  I would highly recommend this product.  The best wood to use is hickory (it is the all around best for all types of meats).  The next best as far as i have found is the Cherry.  It imparts a nice fruity taste to meat.  If anything happens to this smoker. I will certainly buy another one.  This product is one that lasts and lasts!"
9,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly. the label creeps me out a little bit. but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo. body wash. laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
6,"We like to keep one non-electric phone in the house in case power goes out.  We have learned that during hurricanes. earthquakes and even big power failures that sometimes even cell phones don't work but these non-electric phones that plug right into the telephone outlet work when other things don't -that is if your phone service is not from the cable company but driectly from the telephone company. In regular day-today activies we use only cordless and cell phones but they can be useless in an emergency so we like the safety of having one phone like this.  This is fine little phone and the price as great."
3,"A very good collection of folk tales from Britain.  The author tried hard to make sure that the stories were commonly from Britain though they may have spread elsewhere or a variation came from elsewhere.  Some very English folk tales?  Henny Penny. Jack and the Beanstalk.  there are many Jack tales. and The Three Bears.  Most have humourous endings and seem to be stories to amuse everyone.  Jacobs.  the author said he used fairy tales in the title because no kid ever asks for a folk tale."
8,"My cat has gotten tape worm a few times now from being infested with fleas (when a cat gets a flea in its mouth that is infected with tapeworm they get it) and nothing worked! I tried a few different tablets and the only thing I found worked to get rid of them was taking my cat to the vet for a shot which was pricey. Just from taking 1.5 of these pills. my cat's worms were gone and for a fraction of the price of taking them to the vet! Would definitely buy these again if needed!"
11,"Up front. this is totally a guy game.The rules are simple and the desire to keep playing is there.  2-6 players use three simple stats to move around the board attacking one another and using various cards that represent weapons. armor. power ups. and 'cheats'.  Play to a certain score. the winner gets an additional stat point.Form alliances. betray your friends. look the other way when it suits you.  The combination of plays are almost endless.If you like small scale war games and are looking for something with a more individual approach to warfare this is the game for you.We even use custom maps (think of those vinyl Dungeons and Dragons mats) to mix it up after a few dozen rounds on the board it comes with (which is double sided)."
12,"Graphics: 8/10 - Really neat little things you might not notice. Sometimes a little too computerized. but still eye-catching.Sound: 8/10 - Very much improved from the first Crash Bandicoot. When things hit the ground. they make a bang. when creatures talk it's amazingly clear and when you're in danger. you certainly know by the sound a creature is making. the rumbling of the ground or the thrilling score.Value: 10/10 - This is one game you will start repeatedly and still have the same enjoyment level every time you play.Overall: 9/10 - A big improvement from the great first game. Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back has it all - story. characters. levels and fantastically constructed colouring and visuals."
1,"I've been using a Braun shaver and these cleaning cartridges for over two years.  They are worth the money---the shaver is clean and glides over my face for each shave.For what it is worth. I'll add a comment that the Braun 8985 Series 5 shaver itself is one of the best-engineered products I have ever encountered. I'm always finding flaws in electronics. etc.  The Braun seems to defy me!!Some have complained about the price of the cartridges.  They are worth it as I have said.  You can keep the shaver clean by following directions to 'vibrate' the hair clippings out and then use a brush---I've done this on trips of up to one month with great success. but that isn't like using the cleaner mechanism with liquid."
11,"This game has serious flaws which Fantasy Flight refuses to address. I have owned it for over a year now and they are in denial or simply don't care about the problems it has. The Lannisters are completely broken and it basically ruins the fun of the game. FF is usually a great company but they drop the ball on this product in both the original edition and now again in this one. I would not recommend this game to anyone and it sits on my shelf gathering dust. It is a great concept and an amazing genre. but the broken aspects of the game (Lannisters are far to weak and Stark/Baratheon are FAR too strong) make the game boring and unplayable."
7,"I bought this to try at my parents' cabin.  They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants. specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated.  So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful.  But. then again many other chemical sprayers reek.  Also. this is not a set it and forget option.  You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply.  Lastly. you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept.  I'd use it again."
8,"I bought the first one and the cat liked it. Do not over microwave. it will melt. The trick to having it last 8 hours is the pets bed.I am using this for a mini doxie. 5.5 lbs. I bought her a tunnel bed. and she wears a light sweater. with the snuggle in her bed she is not waking me up to put it inthe microwave at 3 am.Mini dogs have to be kept warm. they die fast. I micro this and put in her car crate when we travel around town."
11,"This game. along with Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne. is one that I always use as a 'Gateway Game' to get friends and family who are not serious board gamers hooked on games.Ticket to Ride is easy to teach and learn. fun to play over and over again. and doesn't take too long to get through (most games lasting under an hour).  The game doesn't suffer from a lot of random chance (e.g. no dice rolling) and relies on player planning and skill to win.  There is the option to go after other players and have a pretty cut-throat game. but that is not necessary to gameplay if it is not your style.If you are already a big fan of board gaming but you haven't played any of the Ticket to Ride games. skip this one and go straight for Ticket to Ride Europe.  It has a few additional more complicated elements such as ferries and tunnels. and a more complex and congested map board."
1,"I had to try this after reading its description.  My denture comfort liner had come off (as my orthodontist said it would) and I couldn't afford an airline trip to have him reline my upper denture.  I was tired of my denture cream liquefying on me. and replacing the cream at least twice a day to keep my dentures comfortable.  Even after I faithfully followed the instructions. I got poor results.  It felt like I had a liquefying gummy worm candy in my dentures after several hours...and. much to my surprise. the stuff came off in a gooey mass.  I even tried letting the cream air out on my dentures--it's an effort. just getting the cream out of the tube--hoping that exposure to air might mean better results. but that didn't work either."
9,"We live on the beach in Italy for a good part of the summer each year. and the kids spend all day in the water.  I know for me. nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles. so I'm sure it's the same for the kids.  If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product. adult or kids. you should.  I have never had a leak. never had fogging issues. and they are comfortable for extended wear.  I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years. and look forward to the same quality for the kids."
6,"This size of address label has many uses.  Of course. they can be used for addresses on packages and envelopes. but also as identification labels.  I printed a sheet with my name. address and phone number to attach to things I take on vacation.  The print on my inkjet printer was clean and crisp. the ink dried quickly (no smudging). the labels indeed do peel easily and I like the translucent background that works with many surfaces.  Word 2010 had the format in its list of labels and each label was perfectly aligned.  You can also download free templates from Avery's web site."
4,"This is one of the best. and I mean the best explanations of creation without getting 'mushy' religious and anti-scientific. Often Christian views of creation are so anti-scientific and so prejudice that anyone truly wanting a balanced Chrisitan view that includes your mind is left out. This is the DVD for you. Challenging. thought provoking. even funny and entertaining at times. Rob Bell presents to you the best presentation for creation I've ever viewed. You won't be disappointed.I am presenting this material for viewing in a mini-series to and for non-Christian. seeking-the-truth people. I'm not ashamed to present this DVD to these people seeking God. yet skeptical and cautious of the Christian perspective."
9,"I have used lots of traditional and not-so traditional frisbees and this is the best yet.It is just the right weight and size. flexes nicely during catches and flies very. very far.It also slices through strong winds really well and doesnt seem to 'Float' as much as other disks; so goes where you want it.My children. 5 and 7. have finally learned how to throw and catch because this is easier to throw and catching it doesnt hurt their hands.I recommend this product."
7,"I chose this item for an indeterminate tomato plant.  After I initially set this holder at the desired spot. I then assembled this with my hands before my husband brought his power screw driver in to complete the job. The brackets are now securely mounted on our back porch.  I noticed that the brackets can be used from either the long or the short side. depending on how wide the frame or sill is.The holder leans a little down but that is the desired effect I want. so that the plant can benefit from the western sun late in the afternoon.  The deep brackets keep this holder from getting blown off in our strong spring winds."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game I have ever played in my entire life.I have been playing nintendo for years and I have played some of the older Zelda games before but I never owned any. as soon as I tried this game - I immediately loved it and I've played it millions and millions of times.  I am so obsessed with it. I went out and pre-ordered the Wind Waker to get the Zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to Nintendo Power to get the Zelda Collector's Edition disc.There is no need for me to review this game - all I really need to say is buy it.  You will not be disappointed (if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain).  Definitely be sure to get the follow up Majora's Mask and the Wind Waker.  A must play and Link is the best hero ever."
3,"Such a shame that leaders controlling people elders etc are still wounding the body.Numbers of Christians that leave churches because they haven't. Found a way to cope with the pain of betrayal by those who are suppose to love them.Trusting in the power of God to change the situation until you know it's time to change churches take courage.This book maybe the answer to staying open to Gods purpose for you helping you work through the feelings and anger(at times) don't leave God don't stop loving God just because the waters are muddy in the church."
9,"I have owned three of these stoves over the years.  i gave the first two to my kids and ordered this model.  The windscreens are cheaply. made. fall off the stove which then doesnt  support the rear screen.  Once closed it required a hunting knife to open because the inner deck stuck to the lid.  The right burner worked fine but the left burner flamed inefficiently.I feel this stove is a piece of junk and Coleman ought to feel ashamed of the sheet metal worksmanship on it."
2,"I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof. animal proof. and that I can jam pack into the closet so it doesn't take up a lot of space.  This was perfect!It clamps down well. is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.  I only have a few comments:- Why not square the bottom up with the top? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier.- No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box. This would make it pretty darn airtight  although easy to add on )- The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit. Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise. its a small. durable storage box. What else do you want to hear?"
8,"I've had great results from taking New Chapter Zyflamend.  My blood pressure is back to normal and it's really helped with pain from inflammation in my spine and neck due to years of arthritis.  My husband uses the Zyflamend Night Time...2 gel caps about an hour before he goes to bed.  After having trouble sleeping for several years he's sleeping very well without waking up several times a night to go to the bathroom.  I had a wee bit of heartburn the first few days I took it but my stomach got used to the herbs very quickly.  I have a sensitive stomach and I'm having no problems taking this at all now.  I do take it with food.  I highly recommend this product."
12,"I tried to like this game. I really did. but the controls are horrible and some of the worst I've experienced when trying to shoot something. When playing I also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the Playstation platform. While the story is well-done. it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay. So I'll understand if Syphon Filter fans hate me because of this review. but seriously the gameplay is terrible."
4,"Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion. and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years. and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar. you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II). so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks. Paul!"
7,"These things work great!  Make sure you follow the directions to open/set it up. then fill it with water and hang someplace out of the way where the flies collect.  I've hung ours about 50 feet from our patio. under a pine tree where we have a quail block feeding the birds.  Lots of flies gather round there. and these traps fill up quickly.  Nary a fly makes it to our patio. even when we have our meals out there.  Before the fly trap. we were constantly swatting and shooing flies while sitting on the patio.  So glad I found these!  Only downfall. they are a little stinky. I can smell it when I walk by about 8 feet away. but since it's not close to our 'living space'. it's no problem."
6,"I rcvd my black trim line phone today. Out of the 352 reviews I only read the #1 rated ones. to see what was said. Several people said people on the other end cannot hear well. I immediately tested mine. and called 2 friends. who both said they could hear me quite clearly. It is funny how there are always people who harshly criticize products in these reviews. yet so many other people do not find anything wrong. I wonder how that can be. can there really be such a big difference between one unit and another. I thought I would like the Black color best. and it cost less than the White. but I see now that the Black shows finger print smudges very easily. I will be keeping it on my bookshelf for use during power outage."
8,"I've found that almost all cats strongly prefer to drink running water as opposed to still water. Cat eyes are attracted to motion. My cats drink much more often from a fountain than a water dish which makes me feel better about their health. Cats love this thing. the only cons are from the human maintenance side of things.Cons: A water fountain is more work than filling up a dish. You must plug it in. turn it on. clean the pump. replace the filter. and refill the resevoir often. This does get annoying but is not a problem unqiue to this fountain. and to me it's definitely worth it for my cats.The fountain is pleasant looking. a perfect size. and very quiet."
4,"Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley. live and in person.  Sadly. he lost his life in a swimming accident. and the world will be diminished. musically. by this tragedy.  However. some of his finest work is captured here.  This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating. and his voice is haunting.  Give yourself a musical treat. and pick this DVD up.  The only reason I gave it 4. instead of 5 stars. is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine.  The program stalls in this song.  I checked on more than one DVD player. and they both manifested the same pause.  Other than that... a great buy!"
12,"Well. I'm going to have to agree with Darth Vader on the strong part. But as for the force part. I'm nonchalant. Star Wars Rogue Squadron begins somewhere in between Star Wars Episode IV and Episode VI. Let me just say. you'll be visiting place in the Star Wars universe. and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies. which is good with me. The graphics in the game are some of the best you'll ever see on the N64. The music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done. This is. I would say. the best Star Wars Rogue Squadron game ever made! Oh. and by the way. yes I have played Star Wars Rogue Squadron: Rogue Leader. I fully recommend this game! And thats my review! Remember. 'Be a customer. Not a consumer! Period'- Jake Smithers"
1,"I have extremely dry skin and was constantly itching and scratching. sometimes actually causing bleeding. I tried AmLactan Mosturizing Body Lotion and FINALLY got some relief from the constant scratching. It took about four days to completely stop all the scratching. I used the product just once a day. even though the directions say to apply twice daily. Now my skin is soft and silky feeling and the scabs from bleeding have disappeared. The ammonia like smell of older bottles that I have used is no longer present. They seem to have improved the formulation. It's now completely odor free. I just found the 20 ounce size on sale at Costco.com for $15.49 including shipping. I will never stop using this product. It works just as advertized. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin and itching. Visit the manufacturers website at amlactin.com for more information and you can even sign up for their newsletter. I'm a fan FOREVER!"
7,"I bought this last year so this is the first spring I have had to use it.  I am seriously impressed.  I am using it for popping out weeds. hacking down dead vegetation and planting.  It doesn't dig a wide hole and does not work as well as a trowel for removing dirt while planting. but it works much better than a trowel to plant in my horribly rocky clay areas and the blade makes it easy to puncture a hole to put the plant tag.The sharpness of this is tool makes it extremely useful.  I think the serrated blade will make sharpening difficult. but for this price it is well worth getting a new one when it gets dull.  I will definitely do so and am buying some for gifts for my fellow gardening friends.Also. if you wonder what the difference between the models 1515 and 1516. according to the company's web site this one is a stainless version of the black 1515."
7,"After putting this together I found it to be quite unnerving. It reminds me of a javelin. Sure it's long. but it wobbles! Do I really feel comfortable holding a wobbling chainsaw over my head? No. It cuts at the high height level but it is very unsteady and takes a bit of muscle to keep it straight on the branch. The problem is the saw blade head is just too heavy compared with the shaft and bottom.  It basically sways in the air.  I will not be using the extension rather I will just stand on a ladder to reach the higher branches. There really should be a steel pole in each piece to give it some stability. One more thing is that the blade cover doesn't stay on. It should have been designed with a clip of some sort.I'm one of those people who always throws away the product box. but I think I'll be saving this one in case it breaks.Comment Comment  Permalink"
11,"This is just a fun. creative toy.  It starts as a ball and comes apart into mini 'pyramid-like' pieces.  From here. you can use your imagination and create new objects (animals. stars. etc.).  It also has a strangely soothing feel when you are putting it back together.The only drawback is that the magnets could be a little stronger.  Sometimes it is hard to get your new creations to stay together because they slip.  However. overall this is a really cool toy.  Good for kids and adults."
11,"As a teacher. I had to buy this gift for my seven-year-old niece.  She loved making her own book. and the finished product that they send you is very professional looking. like a book that you would purchase from a store.  They even included some tips and activities to help children write their stories. including diagrams for pre-planning and brainstorming.  My niece loves her book and shows it off to everyone - she even took it to school and got to read it at storytime.  This is a great educational activity that really gets children to be creative. and they love it.  Buy it for all of your favorite kids!"
4,"I've never worked out to a DVD or VHS in my life. preferring to go to the gym and take classes. or to use exercise machines.  This DVD was so FUN and diverse. not at all boring or annoying.  Kathy Smith is energic but not overly so. and she avoids talking and counting constantly which I find distracting and irritating.  What I like is the customized option in which you can choose you work out length-- perfect for when you need to save time or when you want a more vigorous. lengthy work out.  You may find yourself flubbing through the first two go-rounds. as I did. until you get the hang of it. but once you catch on. you REALLY feel the burn if you do it right.  Good work-out for beginner or moderate (I'm a moderate) exercisers."
3,"I read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I went on a buying spree and got the other two as well as this short story. I suppose Laine's antics were meant to be comedic relief but I did not laugh not once. His antics were not funny. I did not buy Devlin being so amused by Laine's antics.I was shocked with how they resolved the conflict with Victor. I thought it was a weak plot point. This story was just ok. I wouldn't recommend anyone spending the money to buy it. If it were free. then yes."
7,"I have had this feeder for about 5 years now. it has never fallen apart. I don't know what the other people are talking about-wobbling-if its hung on a tree or pole hook it swings a bit but how does a hanging bird feeder wobble? Anyway its not the best made on the market. but the birds seem to like it. It is a pain to take apart to clean and it should really have metal perches instead of plastic. The squirrels have gnawed off two of the perches since they hang upside down and eat the Safflower seeds (even tho they are not supposed to like it)I am ready to replace it now-but will be looking for a feeder with the metal perches instead."
9,"This is the first resistance band I have.  I admit I am a little disappointed with what I got but it is not the manufacturer's fault.  I like dumbbells better than resistance bands.  But Resistance bands make working out possible anywhere.  Good concept!  I ordered a heavier one right after I received my order.I do not know what makes a good resistance band good. a bad resistance band bad.  They just don't work the same as weights.  The most expensive resistance band will still work weird because they are resistance bands.  They are not my ideal strength training tool. but hey!  It is better than nothing.Just one advice. the medium is still too light.  Go straight to the heavy weight."
6,"Scotch Gift tape is a great product for its intended purpose - wrapping gifts.  The tape is much less noticeable on typical gift wrap than either Scotch Magic Tape (which is a bit too matte for this purpose) or shiny generic tapes.But I have to mark down this particular product down because the amount of product given is so stingy.  Each roll only has 300 inches of tape - compare this to a a Scotch Magic Tape refill that I had sitting in my cabinet that was 1296 inches long.  And I dislike the fact that the product description on Amazon says nothing about how much tape is included. so you won't realize the issue until you get your order."
11,"My three year old son loves this puzzle and has put it together every day for the last week.  It is bright and colorful with cute illustrations of animals at the zoo.  It is age-appropriate for two to four year olds.  I usually help my son put it together by giving him hints on what pieces might work if he gets stuck. but overall it is not difficult for him.  The puzzle has 25 pieces. is a 5 by 5 square. and is fairly large.  The pieces are large. seem durable. and go together easily.  The box is also cute with a carry handle. which allows my son to tote it between rooms and encourages cleaning up after putting it together.  Overall. I have to say this a great puzzle for toddlers and young children."
1,"Lactose intolerance can be very stressful to deal with. Having to decline food. opportunities to eat because you can't digest is embarrassing and annoying. This solves the problem. Take one with your first bite and you can eat dairy products. It says take another after 45 mins but to be safe I would take it 30 mins after if you continue to eat dairy products.I prefer these to the chewables because I can fit a few in my wallet.If you have an empty stomach. be careful when eating lactose containing foods and drinking lots of liquids at the same time. That is the only time I've ever had issues. I took a bite of bagel with cream cheese and a Lactaid and then chugged a bottle of water. needless to say the Lactaid wasn't able to work very well in my empty stomach filled with water and a bit of cream cheese. my stomach was very upset.I drink the Lactaid milk all the time as well - I really like the whole milk.Great products."
2,"I've just returned from down the street where I ended up when I turned on the &#34;wind machine.&#34; (Which is tough because I was in my pagamas!) We had one of these. which was a little smaller. and I still like better because it isn't quite as strong.Seriously. with that much power. you needed a lower low &#34;LOW.&#34; The first night I used it in my bedroom this summer. I had to turn it off because it was just too loud on the lowest setting. The other thing I don't like compared to our old Lasko is that the speed adjustment is on the back (hard to get to in the middle of the night). Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??"
7,"Has the usual (very slight) fade after 5 months. BUT it is not very noticeable I only mention it because I notice everything (live in SB.Cali and we get moisture/sun every day). The material is thick and sturdy...I bought this for my 48-50 inch grill so it would fully cover the sides and it is working out great. Cover would get 4.5 stars but I rounded down due to the color of green being slightly different. to me. that what it looks like in the photos. Will update after a full summer if it holds up and doesn't crack. then bump up to 5 stars."
1,"1. I was scared that it would sting so badly. and no it's totally bearable and it will go away in a matter of few minutes.2. I once used it all over my body (pits. back. chest). and that was a hot day! And I did sweat a bit. but 90-95% of the sweats were eliminated.NOTE: DON'T use it on large area. not only it will sting really bad the night you apply it. the next day whenever your body trying to sweat it will sting too! BUT if you just use it for underarm alone. everything's fine.3. It lasts for approx. 2-3 days before you'll have to reapply it. Once I used a lot (and by a lot I mean A LOT). it stayed effective for over 5 days!!!4. Instead of rolling it directly to your underarm. you should roll it on your palm. and apply it with your palm so that it won't drip."
11,"For those of you who are interested in playing a boardgame. but have really no experience in playing them. this is a great start. Anyone over the age of six or so should not have a problem sitting down and enjoying this beautiful and sleek game.The mechanics are very easy. Collect cards with train cars of the same color to buy enough train cars to cover a route. If there is five blue spaces you need five blue train cards. It really is that simple. There are some wild cards and destination cards that add a bit to the variety. but the what makes this game fun is it's simplicity. Grandparents to grand children can all sit around the table and enjoy this one. My wife and I play and she loves the fact that she can beat the snot out of me in this game."
2,"Bought this to replace a similar one I'd had for many many years.  I really liked the old one. but had repaired the handle many times & it was now beyond repair.  Wish I'd bought this one sooner!  The soft grip is wonderful. & the ridges on the working surface make it glide thru the cheese much easier; no more bogging down. no more  bunched up cheese slices.  Just a nice. wafer thin piece of cheese that does not stick to the plane when you try to take it off."
6,"The following is my fianc&eacute;e's review of the labels.My fianc&eacute; and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding.  We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels.  It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels.  When they printed out. they looked really good.  There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center.  I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer.  I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay.  About three out of 100 labels were messed up.  I recommend these labels.  I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates.  When I put them on the postcards. they looked really good =)"
6,"Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar?Yes. absolutely.The top layer of material. the red layer. is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week's worth of normal use. The adhesive or bonding process isn't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad. Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin."
8,"Many of my friends say Frontline does not work against fleas or ticks in their area any more. so have switched to other flea/tick control brands.  Well. it still works for my dogs. though we really don't have many fleas where we live in the desert.  I mostly used it when we lived in an area where ticks were prevalent.  I use it on the dogs only about every 3-4 months. just in case. as I do attend dog shows. and don't want to bring any visitors home with me...  Be aware that studies show that Frontline can be detected on humans' hands weeks after applying to the dogs...so wash after petting. ( Advantage showed transfer to humans for even longer periods of time. and that is imidacloprid. so would never use that product.  )"
1,"This product is an excellent buy and at 1/4th the cost at any store or online sites.  My family loves the product and recommend this product as a great buy.  I even subscribed so the product  is delivered without having to go and order it.  The product just comes when I decide how often.  This is a wonderful program which recommend to all who use products and not have to go and order it over and over!!  A must buy with an awesome program to make it easier to get the best at a good cost :)"
4,"Wow. this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan. and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert. even if you dont know Jeff. is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album. and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great. try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!"
7,"I have been using this for a little while now and while it seems to work fairly well it only lasts a week without rain and if it rains you pretty much have to go out there the same day and reapply or you get to wake up first thing in the morning to your strawberries that hang near the fence being eaten...It's good idea for the most part but it's something that just doesn't really seem to be a lasting benefit and it seems to be a more natural avenue for repelling the deer and it does work just not nearly as long as I would like it to.I've been using it for a couple month on the garden/around it to keep the unwanted animals away and it does seem to work pretty good so far. just as I said. it doesn't last nearly as long as I would like it to."
11,"Got this for my nephews years ago for christmas and they loved it so much that every year they ask for another one. They love coming up with the story and then drawing all the pictures. Then once it comes in the mail they are so pleased that they made their own story they take it into school. they show everyone who comes over and they will have it for the rest of their life to show their kids. This is amazing and i love doing it every year because it shows what they liked at the time and keeps them interested in learning."
7,"I have about 5 sets of these for each hose at my house as well as my Gilmour foam gun. AR pressure washer. CR Spotless. and a couple of hose nozzles.  The brass is strong. the mechanics are crisp. and the rubber gives excellent impact protection.  The only thing you will be replacing from this equation is the o-rings every year or so. depending on use.  This set will make your life a whole lot easier. and no more struggling in trying to loosen or tighten the hose from the house."
11,"This is the slightly less complicated version of Arkham Horror. Think of it as a kind of Lovecraftian Yahtzee - you roll dice to defeat monsters and occurrences in the rooms of a museum. trying to build up a collection of 'elder signs' that can be used to seal away a great evil. It's not too difficult to win if at least one of the players knows the rules. There is plenty of replay value as there are tons of random rooms and dimensions to battle in. as well as monsters.There is also an excellent iOS version of this game that I highly recommend. too."
3,"I don't have a problem with sex scenes. even explicit ones.  I like them when there is also a story where to place them.  In this book there is sex and more sex and the story is not present at all. at least in the first half that was all I could read.  I was hoping for more substance and that is what kept me reading.  But there was only sex for sex sakes.  If you like erotica with a bit of a story then this is for you but if what you like is romance with sex in it then I don't think that you would like this book."
1,"My sandals will sometimes rub blisters.  I don't like to wear bandaids or corn cushions. too freaking obvious.  This band aid blister cushions are pretty close to perfect.  They are flesh toned. (if you are beige colored. any darker skinned and they will be obvious.  Makes me wonder. why don't they make these in different skin tones?  Sounds like a great idea to me) and they protect the spots on your feet that are blister prone.  I use a ton of these and buy them often.  Highly. highly recommend."
1,"These work with both my Braun's.  I have an older one and decided I would buy a new model instead of replacing the heads.  The first one was not their top of the line. the second unit I decided to go all out as the first one had been great.  I know it is these cleaner kits that go into the base station for both that make a huge difference.  When I was traveling 200+ days a year and I'd get home (and the device would be begging for an intense cleaning) the cleaning made the device like new.  Just a great system...not on the cheap side as it is an added disposable cost. but it makes a big difference on the effectiveness of the shaver.  If you have a unit that takes these it is worth keeping them fresh and ready to go to get the real benefit out of your wonderful shaver.  if not. get one with your next shaver...it's worth it!"
8,"My miniature schnauzer LOVES this toy. This is my second one buying (not because it broke- because it has gotten so nasty) He drags it with him EVERYWHERE. We have to make him drop this toy. The only downside is if you have hardware floors. this toy WILL scratch them so be careful... My boxer likes this toy as well but not as much because her teeth are alot smaller. I would recommend it for a dog with bigger teeth. I have noticed an improvement in his gum strength. I have had to brush his teeth less since getting this toy and he LOVES it!!! I cannot say enough how much my dog loves this toy. Also. while crate training he used to chew his bed. but once we got this toy he has not touched his bed. If we leave his toy out of his crate. his bed is chewed again........ LIFE SAVER!!!!!!!! Love Nylabone. love this dinosaur!"
12,"When this game came out. it was like a historic event.  It felt like there was no longer a limit to what video games could do.  Every toy store had a booth set up where you could give this game a try.  It was amazing to play and amazing to see.This game is still amazing.  The play control is amazingly smooth. and you can make mario do some unbelievable things.  The worlds are amazing.  You can go wherever you want to go. do whatever you want to do.Just look at the difference between this game. and the original Super Mario Bros. for NES.  My gosh. the difference is astounding.  It's amazing how Nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades.  Sometimes I love progress."
8,"My dog loves fetch and I am a huge fan of the Chuckit! launcher. however the tennis balls only seemed to last about a week tops.  The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces.  I thought this was just how life was going to be: forever buying these balls for our launcher.  Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it.  I bought a pack of 10 cheap-o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we're still using on our first ball- amazing!  It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce.  Thank you. Chuckit! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size.  I will happily buy another launcher if my current one ever wears out. but I won't waste my money on these tennis balls."
1,"During Utah's dry winters. I experience daily nose bleeds.  I've tried saline nose spray and humidifiers.  After a particulary bad nose bleed lasting almost 24 hours. I researched other treatments.  I had nothing to loose from trying the Ayr gel.  THIS STUFF WORKS!  I haven't had nose bleeds since using the product.  I wish I would have known about it years ago.  But two instructions for best success:1.  Put the get on the tip of the finger (not the bottom) and rub it all around INSIDE the nose & up as high as you can get it. (make sure your fingernail is cut short).2.  Look at your nose in the mirror about an hour later - sometimes there will be white stuff visible.  You want to make sure you don't gross people out.3.  I have to use the product twice daily to prevent all bleeds.This product changed my life; no more daily bleeds!"
12,"The sequel to the very popular Tekken. Tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it. More characters. more levels. more moves. Tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover.The combat in Tekken is one of best ever. There are so many possible combinations. it's almost impossible to remember them all. Each Tekken gets better and better. Another thing I love about this game is the music. It suits the stages. and characters. well."
11,"My son is a game designer and buys games for us to play.  This is one of my favorites--I've even won a few times over my sons who are both smarter than me.  As an educator. I think it's a fun way to learn geography.  We love playing it over the holidays.  It's not too easy and not too difficult.  2 to 4 of us have played it and enjoyed it equally.  I see this Christmas my son is asking for the 1910 version. as it's on his wish list.  I want to try the Europe extension so will ask for that. This is a quality game that everyone should enjoy."
4,"Elmo is so entrancing. I have no idea how he does it. but when this DVD is on. my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo. I get some much needed 'Me time'...Although this DVD gets old for me some days. it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!"
11,"I first played this game at a Thankgiving party with a group of people ranging from 9 years old (my son) to 60's.  It's fun for everyone and challenging.  It was easy to learn with the guest who brought the game explaining as we played the first time.  Even my 9 year old picked it up quickly.So I purchased it for home and we've been playing ever since.I like that you get your own tiles and work from your own build.  Each person works on their own word puzzle.I've never gotten into Scrabble. so I'm not a wordy. but I was able to play this.This is a fast paced game that encourages vocabulary and works on spelling as well as different meanings of words.  A definate conversation starter with kids who will ask if different letter placings are words.The packaging is cute in the banana that holds the tiles.  A zipper is used to open and close it."
3,"If I had to use just one word to describe this book it would be. Awesome! I absolutely loved it! I only put it done when necessary. and finished it in one day (which is hard to do when you have two daughters lol). I'm an action kind of girl and this book is full of it.Even though Marc hurt Blake in the past. Blake is still loyal and cares for his sire. though he still harbors some feelings of rejection and hurt. When they meet Kate they are quite surprised by her. Through a game of conquest to gain the affection of Kate. they not only both fall for her but they also settle some issue from the past. There is a little m/m sex and some erotic dreams. not much. but what is there is totally hot!"
9,"My wife uses this as her camping 'kitchen' knife.  She. however. doesn't like to carry it. finding it too heavy for wearing in her hiking shorts.  It does not have a pocket clip. but comes with a belt sheath.  This should have been my first warning it was too heavy for her pocket.  Oh well. still a great addition to our gear.The unserrated blade is easy to sharpen and holds an edge well and the locking mechanism is strong and positive. The grip truly is 'all weather' as claimed. It has an excellent texture. which combined with its rubbery construction gives one a great grip even when wet."
12,"Ok. I'll admit it. I have a Gameboy of my own. 40-something mother of two. and I got one for myself so that I could play with my kids. They're great! We are all great Pokemon fans. which is how we got sucked into the whole  Gameboy thing. and those are still our favorite games.The only drawback  that I find with the thing is that it does need to be well-illuminated.  otherwise you'll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen. But  that aside. these babies are fun! My kids love them. I love mine. great fun  all around. Go for it!"
12,"If you like racing games that are unique. this is for you. You can race by yourself. or with a friend. Not only that. but you can also challenge your friends in battle mode with some really fun arenas. If your more of a solo player like me. don't worry. there are four different tournaments that you can play.You can even use different items either to slow down the other racers. or to help you pass them up. Of course every item has it's own effects. there are a few that are hard to get. That's because they're special. learn how to use them. and the competition will be eating your dust.And last. but far from least. there is a special mode you can unlock for an even bigger challenge. Yeah. this game will keep you busy no matter how you play. It's definately a must-have. order it while you can."
4,"I was a huge fan of exploitation cinema back in the day. So I was a bit disappointed when I could not remember ever seeing this 'classic'. And I am even more disappointed for having seen it now. It's not going to win awards (not even Razzies) and everything screams 'tacky'. but I guess I'm just mellowing with age. Not for serious fans of realistic cinema or quality films. but certainly for people who enjoy their guilty little delights. I'm just not of those people anymore. I guess."
12,"I don't see all the hype in this portable gaming device. The games graphics are so terrible (So is Game Boy Advance). The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which isn't too shabby. But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it's a waste of money. Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors (It's not that good) and plus the addition of bad graphics...now that's what I call a bad deal."
7,"Sure. this kinks a lot less easily than a rubber hose. but NEVER SAY NEVER!!!  It's a decent hose with nice HD brass ends. but it WILL kink.  Keep in mind if you're using a hose in colder weather. rubber is the only way to go.  These vinyl hoses STINK in the cold and have a memory of how they're stored.  They're awesome in warmer climates though!Overall we're happy with the hose. but believe it shouldn't claim that it'll &#34;Never Kink&#34;."
2,"I absolutely love this book! Before purchasing. I found myself gathering bits and pieces of information from the wilton site to make the flowers and borders that I wanted. but this book puts them all together neatly without leaving anything out. I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful. but so much of it is advanced. and I'm just not there. I only decorate for fun. This book sticks to basics which. for me. is essential to focus. If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious. Then I end up giving up. So. with this book I can actually follow the process and learn step by step without the frustration.The only small disappointment was the weight of the cover. The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well. Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though. so no big deal."
2,"It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars. I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value. As some reviewers have pointed out. much of the book focuses on advertising Wilton products; without all of this the useful material in the book could have been condensed down to a couple of pages. I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses. I had initially planned on getting the subsequent lesson plans as well. but I don't think it will be worth it. If you have any skill/experience with cake decorating at all. I'd recommend skipping this book."
9,"I own several brands of Multi-tools. SOG. Gerber. Leatherman and now Victorinox. Nothing against the other brands. they are each very good in their own right. but this tool is nothing less than the Swiss perfection that you would expect from Victorinox. The pliers are very smooth and not stiff like the other brands (with exception to the spring assisted Gerber EVO or Butterfly). And the accessories are the easiest of all brands to open. they work just as smooth as opening up any Victorinox knife. and I might add they are also just as sharp. The only thing that could make this better is the opening of the pliers; I have yet to find any multi-tool that opens as smooth and as easy as the gear driven SOG PowerLock. Just my $0.02.....!!! I highly recommend the RS and would definitely buy this one again."
1,"I have always kept a hefty scrub brush around for I have an old kitty that loves to toss up her dinner occasionally. plus a young puppy that often feels left out and follows suit.  Scrub brushes are easy to find and probably never considered here much on Amazon.  But trust me when I tell you that not only is this a terrific brush. but it is also very hard to find in stores.  The power behind this baby is its contoured plum like handle that sits directly on top.  It gives you maximum comfort for your hand while directing the brushes where you want without you getting tired and the brushes just slipping lightly over the stain.  The handle and the brushes are of a great quality and and I bought two for different parts of the house.  Definitely a vast improvement over the usual handles we all are used to seeing on brushes like this. and at a very fair price here on Amazon. The best. and highly recommended..."
2,"Can't chop anything well.  [Tried onions. tomatoes. celery. olives. nuts. and many other items.]  Tried 2. 4. and 8-oz loads.  Tried 1/8. 1/4. 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half 'as is'.I think it could 'mix' 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler. blender. and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them."
1,"I've been a pack a day smoker for 40 years now and I just gotta kick this stupid habit. Been using these every day for the past six weeks now and have not yet smoked a cigarette in that time. I think that at this point it might just be psychological. but I'm still tempted to head over to 7-11 and buy a pack. so I keep putting on a 21 mg patch every morning and continue to tell myself how disgusting it would be if I start smoking again. Still taking it minute by minute and day by day. but I never could be doing this without the aid of the NicoDerm patches."
2,"I recently received a bread maker and the crust on the whole wheat loaf is quite thick. thus my butter knives just weren't up to the task.  Therefore. I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.  I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like. and the reviews were good.  I'm happy to say. that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.  I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.  It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all... you can't go wrong!"
8,"Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy. and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy.  The toy is very rugged. yet soft enough to interest them.  So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy.  We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also.  These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys.  So far so good with ours."
6,"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use.  They're an Avery product. so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them. so formatting the print data is a snap.  What makes these labels different is their construction.  They're thicker than the typical mailing label. with a white front and a dark gray sticky side.  This makes the labels truly opaque. so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over.  I've tried to see through them. and I haven't been able to.  This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."
1,"If you have high LDL cholesterol and you have not been able to reduce it with diet and exercise. this Slo-Niacin tablets will do the job. The slow release minimizes flashing that is normally associated with Niacin and the results are incredible. I have been trying to lower my Cholesterol for the last couple of years but with no success. I was stuck in the range of 230-235 and even though I was taking Flash-Free Niacin. my number was not dropping. Two months ago I found out by reading posts on the Internet that Flash-Free Niacin does not work for lowering cholesterol. So. I started looking for another way and found the Slo-Niacin which is regular niacin that is released slowly. This worked great. I took 1500 mg a day for a month and my cholesterol dropped from 233 to 130.  I was shocked by how well it worked.  It makes you wonder why doctors prescribe drugs when a natural supplement like Niacin works so well."
1,"I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.Best of all. it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the 'normal' light is on. or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job..."
4,"Though it's been a while. I recall this as being a rather excellent film.  Peter Chattaway tells us that 'disparate elements are woven into Joseph's story without sacrificing the film's dramatic unity; the result is unexpectedly coherent. even poignant....[It]is about as rich a three-hour epic as one could want from television: complex. challenging and convincing. it has enough emotional power to draw you into its world and enough realism to make you want to stay there (Review: The Bible Collection. Patheos(dot)com. 1996)"
11,"I've been playing Scrabble for years. and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago. I really like it! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously. it's a very fast-paced. energetic game. Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group. Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes. if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something. they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait.In some ways. the game is more accessible than Scrabble. A good vocabulary still helps a lot. as does a good familiarity with two-letter words. but knowledge of really esoteric long words isn't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble. They're two completely different games. and I still do enjoy Scrabble. but I'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well. There's a time and a place for both."
3,"I love reading mini novels and you can't go wrong when it's by Jane Porter.  Yet another great read by this amazingly talented author.  I fell in love with Estrella.  She is not only beautiful. but she is strong. compassionate and determined.  Carlo is the man you want to hate. but instead end up wishing he was yours.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  Not only did the character's personalities draw you in. but the story-line makes you want to reach out and help those that are less fortunate.  I highly recommend this mini novel.  It's a perfect marriage of love. hate. romance and philanthropy."
10,"I am always trying to buy American made products when I can but every once in a while something so good gets imported that even I have to buy it. These discs are an example. Made in Finland. I was using 3M gold discs on a fender sanding down some paint and there was a little rust on it also. The 3M was doing decent job but then I put these on and it was literally night and day difference. These cut literally 2 times as fast even though are the same grit I am not sure how it is possible but the proof is in the pudding. Lasted longer also. Will definitely buy again."
6,"I use paper cutters primarily for origami. where getting straight and accurate cuts is CRITICAL. Unfortunately it's very hard to get them correct with this trimmer. First. the guides are relatively wide compared to other cutters. so it's hard to know where precisely to line the paper up. The other issue is that the guide in the middle of the cutter is further down on this larger size than on the smaller model. This makes is much more difficult to line paper up if you are cutting to sizes of around 6 inches or less. which I very often am (cutting 12x12 scrapbook paper to 6x6). It doesn't handle multiple sheets particularly well. I could do about 3 or 4 before I started having issues. but it's the accuracy of it that is the biggest issue for me personally. If you don't need perfect cuts though it's a good enough trimmer and certainly will do the trick for photo use and other less critical jobs."
7,"This is a high quality food grade DE and is labeled as such .  Believe it is the finest powder I have ever purchased and is rated the purest I have found .  My wife and I use it internally. plus I use it on the yard. under my home. garden and my large dog pens .  It works well in my Dustin Miser (sold on Amazon) . producing a very fine cloud of DE dust .  Because it is a very fine powder it coats things well and kills ticks. fleas. Colorado potato bug larva. most ants. and even most hard shell pests . People don't think DE will kill hard shell pests but even they have connecting membranes between the hard shell parts. and legs that can be damaged or cut . This product was shipped FAST and I highly recommend it and this seller to anyone ."
7,"I've had this grill for about two months now and I love it. It's nice to see that Char-broil has taken the initiative to break free from the standard black. rectilinear grill. This grill tucks neatly into the corner of my back deck and looks great. Friends are always commenting on it.As for cooking. the smaller grill surface has proven to be ample for parties of four when cooking fish. steaks or skewered items. For sandwich-style grilling (e.g.. hamburgers. hotdogs. etc.) you can cook for twice that many. The cooking surface itself is a refreshing change as well; the metal slats are thick and give restaurant-style grill marks to your food. while providing more surface area for smaller items to sit on. The Patio Caddie comes with hickory-scented briquettes that enhance the flavor and mask the gas scent.Be sure to consider the Patio Caddie if you're in the market for a high quality gas grill in this price range. You can't go wrong!"
1,"I bought FRER pregnancy tests after two years of using the cheaper Wondfu tests on amazon. I loved the wondfu tests and  left excellent feedback but my third batch I got false positives which was. obviously. heartbreaking. I decided to spend more money and buy these tests instead. Well I got my BFP today and confirmed with a digital EPT brand test as well.  I'm 13 DPO and my period was due in 1-2 days. I did test earlier with these pregnancy tests and all tests were negative until today!! I recommend these tests - accurate and quick/clear results."
10,"I have been buying this glue in this exact quantity for years now and I am here to say that it is an absolutely great performer.  Though I have used polyurethane glues and epoxy (I have yet to try the new Titebond III). this Titebond II is the glue I turn to 99% of the time.  It has never let me down in any application - I build mainly indoor furniture and jigs.Once cured. the strength of this glue is consistently stronger than the wood around it.  I have had good luck with letting it dry and scraping the squeeze-out away with a sharp chisel and/or a flexible putty knife.  After sanding I have had no problems with splotchiness in finishes.I made the mistake of buying too much of this glue at once a few years ago and learned the lesson that it will go bad over time.  Now I always buy this glue in these bottles and never have problems.Highly recommended!"
6,"Haven't used Avery labels for quite some time; however. since i recently became treasurer of our HOA. it's my duty to mail dues requests twice a year - labeling envelopes is never fun. but decided to try these labels... in the past. picking the label off the sheet was a wearisome. repetitive task... but now. with Avery's redesign of its label sheets. a quick two folds of the printed sheet of labels. and label edges pop up - making the job of peel-and-place a *lot* easier! Good job. Avery!"
6,"The satin finish is supposed to make this more invisible than regular 'Magic' tape when used on gift wrap.  To my eyes. there is almost no difference.  So the only reason to get this is if the price is better than regular 'Magic' tape.  As I write this review. it is!To be clear. there's nothing WRONG with this tape.  It works just as well as regular 'Magic' tape.  It's very hard to see when applied.  And. I assume. it'll have the same remarkable durability as regular 'Magic' tape.  It's just that it's special feature (satin finish. more invisible on gift wrap) doesn't work."
2,"I bought the 12&#34; size 6 years ago and they are still serving me well. I just bought the 16&#34; & 9&#34; sizes for almost $30 and if they are as good as the older 12&#34; ones. I'm OK with spending that coin. They are easy to clean. do not rust. and the locking mechanism is super nice! Cheap tongs with that cheesy metal slide annoy me to no end as they enviably slide down and lock the tongs when I need to pick something up. Spontaneous locking is not a problem with these."
4,"I am not Christian. But I read bible many times and saw many movies to know the life of Jesus Christ. After thinking of Christ many times. his life and kindness influenced me a lot. Unknowingly I started keeping him in my heart always. He gives me peace. love and compassion. He shows the way of life to one and many.When I bought this DVD. I could not wait to reach home to see this outstanding breath taking depiction of the last part of his life. I loved the possible reality that has been shown and understood the human cruality/apathy very well even though I hated the strong violence in any form. But Jesus Christ's mission is truely accomplished and he is in hearts of the majority of the world. In my opinion. the life of Jesus Christ as depicted here makes more interesting and reaches more millions."
1,"I got this a few days ago and each day my handlebar looks better. It's like my mustache is learning to form a curl on both sides. This goes on soft and easy with very little work and then after about 15 to 30 seconds it sets and you have a very firm but still pliable hold. It has a very pleasant fresh scent that reminds me of grapefruit. It washes out very easily my one complaint is that the neutral shows up as white on my red stache and makes me look like i'm greying or have dried boogers unless I am very judicious in my use of the product. So until I find something else this is my go to with a light touch."
1,"I shave my head basically every day. and these bad boys are definitely sharp enough for the task. In fact. I have to be extra careful the first few times I use a blade. because I can easily chop some skin off my skull! Some people say the blades you get online are lower in functionality than those you get in the drug store or whatever -- I have never found this to be the case. The biggest change in functionality. durability. etc is when you go from using the blade that comes with the handle to the blades you buy in a pack. Yes. they put really good blades in with the first handle to get you hooked. then they sell not-as-good blades afterward once they have you hooked. If you don't know this about disposable razor blades. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you.The price was right for me. and the blades work to slide the dead hair from my scalp and face. I'm satisifed."
1,"This is a great price for batteries. you could pay a couple of bucks a retail store for only 1 or 2 when you can get 10 on Amazon!  These little LR44's are found in so many of my children's toys. the Thomas the Tank Engine cars that talk. Tinkerbell that glows. Christmas ornaments. even some little cheap twirling lights bought at the dollar store.  I have ordered these twice now. because something new dies and I find that it needs the same kind of battery.  It's definitely more economical to buy in this quantity than buying a couple at a time!  They also work well and last. too.  Stock up HERE!!"
10,"Some years ago I stopped buying any sandpaper that wasn't Norton 3X. It lasted 4-5 times longer that any other I had. I only used a finish sander and sanding blocks. When I purchased a random orbital sander and went looking for paper these looked like they were worth a try. They last so long that I probably have a lifetime supply (I also bought all the other grits available). Most of my sanding is on raw wood. When sanding finished/stained wood...well I haven't yet found a paper that doesn't clog. Still use the Norton for all finish/block sanding jobs."
10,"Well. I have yet to buy a DeWalt tool that I haven't been happy with. and this saw is no exception.  This saw makes consistent cuts and has a ton of great features.  I would make two suggestions when buying it that some people may overlook:First. I would buy a quality blade for use with your intended projects rather than the one included (it cuts. but as with most blades included with saws. probably isn't going to satisfy your needs)Second. I would strongly suggest picking up the optional rip fence (DW3278).  You can usually find it up for around $10.00. and it makes long straight cuts infinitely easier.  Definitely a good investment!Nevertheless. I am extremely happy with this saw.  THe only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the included accessories (and lack of an included rip fence)."
3,"So maybe I have read too many m&eacute;nage stories but this just story just did not work for me. I realize it is a short story so not a lot of character development or background but to me Cassie just came off as kinda whiny and wimpy....yes you're in love with your two best friends. and yes. you see them getting it on. you obviously were not that good of friends if you ran off with no explanation or confronting them about it (or maybe I am expecting the character to do what I would do which is call them on it...not that I have ever been in love with two people equally or at the same time....) so while I normally like this author this one just did not do it for me. I guess I like my heroines a bit stronger...."
6,"When you need a phone during an emergency or power outage. when you want a phone that is reliably located on the 'base' where someone hasn't walked away with the handset. this is the IDEAL phone! The phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack.  If you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord.  I like this! It's nice that companies are engineering with cost savings in mind! The phone comes with pulse and tone dialing (needed to use computerized dialing.)"
4,"I was raised Catholic and still am a Catholic as I go to mass now ever Sunday even though I didnt go for awhile in my early 20's. I left the theater feeling like a bad Mary Magedeline. It was a great movie though but not great that you want to watch it over and over. The androgynous Satan was really creepy. I felt like the bad Catholic that I have been after watching this. As a kid I used to like going to 'The stations of the cross' events at the church during Easter but this is so graphic all it did was make me feel like a bad Catholic and that I need to go to confession really bad."

1,"After a friend burned some gum tissue on some overheated coffee. a dentist recommended this product. both for its healing properties and overall cleansing ability.  As listed above. this product is recommended (by 'dental professionals!')for canker sores. gum irritations. denture & mouth sores. orthodontic irritations. mouth burns. and cheek bites (I'm not sure what the latter is).  I tried a little. and the taste was pleasant and the liquid nonirritating.  There is a mild foaming action as well.  Use ONLY as directed by a dentist or other knowledgeable health professional."
3,"This 'book' contains 5 pages of oversize type - really boiling down to. maybe 2 pages worth of writing. The author has one main premise - that the gov is covering up the UFO phenomena to prevent economic chaos and panic - more on the economic side...That's about all. Oh. and of course the obligatory link to the author's other 'books'.Save your $1. (I downloaded this when it was free)By the way:  The description states that it is about 9 pages long... that is only if you count the cover. title-page. a couple of blank pages. and the author's listing of other 'books' he has for sale..."
10,"This tool performs very well. It sands very quickly. Faster than my Dewalt and Porter Cable palm grip R/O sanders. The variable speed is very useful for sanding face frames on cabinets or other tricky spots. The dust  collection works O.K. A shop vac helps a lot though. The only problem is  that some times the pad comes unthreaded from the mechanism and flies off.  Maybe some thread lock would help. I'm not alone with this problem. I saw  others' comments posted on Bosch's chat room about this. Don't let that  stop you from getting an otherwise good tool. Just periodically check the  screw on the pad."
8,"Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV.  It is a great ramp. easy to use. very sturdy. a cinch to unfold and very lightweight.  The tread is very good and provides for sure footing.  We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight.  It is plastic. so being outside doesn't hurt it and the water runs right off it.  I am really happy with it."
3,"This book has a good basic storyline.  However. I found the writing to be of a rather jerky and staccato style. especially in the descriptive areas.  It was rather difficult to follow at times as it jumps around a bit and with the formatting problems (quite a few) I found myself trying to figure out where I was in the story. It took me longer to read than it should have because of that. Reformatting would definitely help you keep track of what is happening. I did feel that there were a few things that could have been left out of the story as they really weren't incorporated into the storyline very well. just seemed to be thrown in because you have to be explicit about some things (x-rated).  Thank goodness for the fast page turnings on the Kindle! Even with all this. I still wanted to keep reading to find out what happened."
4,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE KID'S VIDEO.  We originally borrowed this from the library.  We liked it so much. and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again. that we decided to buy it.  The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time.  I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months. but it still holds their interest.  The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers.  We all sing along and. quite frankly. I can't get the songs for the numbers 3. 5. and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD."
2,"This scoop has a comfortable handle and a good shape for attacking hard ice cream straight out of the freezer. The chrome finish is attractive and seems like it would be more durable and dishwasher-safe than the ridiculous (and unnecessary) non-stick finish I have on my other Oxo scoopOXO Good Grips 26481 Nonstick Beak Ice Cream Scoop. I prefer to dip this in water before use (so it will glide through the ice cream). and to wash it by hand afterward. This isn't an all-metal scoop. like theOXO Good Grips Solid Stainless Steel Ice Cream Scoop. so I'm a little concerned about its longevity."
4,"Actually. I would give this two scores--a 3 for those already familiar with Gettysburg and a 4 for those not. I can't give a score of 3.5. so I have rounded to 4 stars.For those familiar with the battle. little will be gained by viewing this--other than the very welcome bird's eye view of the battlefield. For instance. the coverage of Pickett's charge doesn't mention the involvement of Trimble's and Pettigrew's forces on the third day.For those not so familiar with Gettysburg. this will be a good introduction. A lot of details are left out. but the basics--from Buford's stand on Day One to &#34;Pickett's Charge&#34; on Day Three--are presented. The stories of Wesley Culp and Jennie Wade provide a certain poignancy to the DVD.So. nice cinematography. a plus. Basic description of the battle--a plus for neophytes and not so much for those familiar with the battle."
8,"Bought used - opted for this version of a ramp for my pack of aging herding dogs - 50 # Aussie/BCs and a 75# Bouvier des Flandres - who were beginning to tear my aging back. Made in USA from  heavy duty plastic by the same folks who made the floor mats I got for the truck (Weather Tek). Folds easily. The weight is necessary for the sturdiness I need (plan to throw in the truck bed when not being used). No metal to rust. Textured ramp built in (no peeling). Altogether the ramp is an ideal product I was very pleased to buy at 60% retail cost."
7,"I bought these a year ago but hadn't used them much.  I just began using them this spring and loved them - would have given them five stars until today.  Ironically I just ordered another pair yesterday because they are so easy to use - lightweight and sharp.But today the orange clamp that keeps them closed when not in use no longer does its job and they stay open all the time which makes them bulkier to carry as they are much less compact with both blades and handles splaying out.  That's the reason for only 3 stars. After today's malfunction I wouldn't order them again.  Plus the price has gone up in a year from $8.68 to $11.79. They are VERY useful - I just wish they were sturdier."
3,"I am not one to give bad reviews but I could not get into this book.  The sex was hot.  I am not too into m/m sex but in this book it wasn't bad.  you could actually feel for both men.  But Cassie's character I did not like.  She comes into town after being engaged for 10 months and within 5 mins is having sex with Kyle & she was pretty much the one making it happen.  I did not like all her self doubts.  I guess the last chapter was the best in the book.  So all & all it was an okay read but not happy I spent money on it."
4,"People who don't like it because of the gore. Let me tell you something. The gore scenes in this film are extremley grade school compared to the way it really happened. There has never been or ever will be a civilization as decadent and barbaric as the roman empire. They were masters of torture and what the Jesus Christ suffered in this film was nothing even close to what the real Jesus Christ endured for us so we wouldn't have to go to Hell. The Non Christian who watches this film can not truly appreciate the love Jesus had for us going to the cross like the Christian can. Watch it not the gore scenes. You want to see gore watch Dawn Of The Dead or The Burning Moon. You want a true love story watch this film."
10,"While remodeling my home. we were taking up the floor boards on the second floor. so we could access the electric to the first floor ceiling fans.  The house is old and still had gas pipe in the floors from the old 'gas lighting'. and to add to the confusion it still had the knob and tube wiring.  Needless to say it was tight working between the joists.  Thats were the DeWalt DW160 came in....it fit down inbetween the joists nicely. and had enough power to get the job done.  As mentioned in another review. and keyless chuck would have been great. but other than that this drill is a great thing to have around."
7,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together.  They stay open about an inch and a half!  There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad. the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
8,"My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ &#34;babies&#34;...this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor. I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear! Very soft. strong build quality (he has used it for over 6 months; 70lb German Sheppard/Doberman and &#34;plays&#34; with his &#34;babies&#34;). I highly recommend this product as a cost-effective toy that. for my dog at least. is a must-have on a daily basis. As I type he is laying with it on his bed!"
1,"This is a weird sort of &#34;goo&#34; that comes out malleable like fairly hard putty. It can be molded. but it's a little too hard to mold to the gums well enough. I left it in for a few days and it was VERY hard to remove! It seems to have a slightly glue-like consistency. I can see it being perhaps useful in &#34;fine-tuning&#34; a temporary reline kit. but DON'T confuse it with actual denture adhesive. It doesn't stick to the gums AT ALL."
11,"My daughter. (who is now 8 years old). received this as a christmas gift when she was 2.  It has been ready many times. and since been passed along to my son who is now 4.  My children enjoy the tactile quality of the monkeys faces. It is helpful learning counting when there is something they can feel.  I have always enjoyed reading the sing song story.  It doesn't take long to read. and after all these years I pretty much have it memorized.  A great book. very fun."
6,"This HP Multipurpose Copy/Laser/Inkjet with 96 Brightness. I was so glad to find in a local store last week. So I have been printing letters. forms. misc type of documents on it and am amazed the brightness of the paper for such a reasonable price! And since I have an HP Printer. I am glad to have paper with HP's endorsement (on the back of the wrapping for this paper. it states that it was actually made by International Paper Company under license of HP). So this paper is made for HP and other quality types of printers. whether HP or another brand.So glad I am using this paper now as in the past. I paid for the generic and cheap types of paper that a brightness of about 88. which is not that good when it is compared to 96 brightness. And the old generic paper cost the same price as this high quality paper.For the cost of this product and the quality. this is in my opinion a BEST BUY!"
12,"Extremely difficult to play unless you're an expert. Great graphics. Problem with this video game is that it does get old after maybe an hour or so. Many levels to conquer. I'd only recommend this game to those who have plenty of patience. You know. the SAME kind of patience you need to have while on Ebay just waiting for a posted item's time to run out while them other 'have no-life' buyers often snipe the item YOU wanted SO badly in the last fifteen seconds. That kind of patience."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.It's Darth's ship. You gotta have Darth Vader in the collection. or it wouldn't be Star Wars. The abilities the pack adds are also great."
11,"Take my review with a grain of salt since I haven't played through a whole campaign but what I do know is- A lot of minis and a variety of them. Don't let the red/white scheme scare you away- Lots of good quality cardboard and cards. Colorful art.- Essentially a tactical miniatures fantasy game of 1 vs 2-4- Meant to be played as a campaign and requires a dedicated group of consistent gamers- Fair amount of setup time needed. but well worth it.- Not a dungeon crawl / exploration since both sides have goals to pursue.- Lots of small and large expansions which can use up your savings but do not require any expansions to have a good game.If you are okay with all of the above then this game is for you."
10,"I have had the 690 Porter Cable router for years and finally committed that one to a table. This is the same motor (without the speed control) but with the 'D' handle. Loads of power. really convienent to use. I find that I don't use the speed control all that much. Woodcraft offered the Porter Cable 892 kit as a replacement for this one. The guy said that Porter Cable quit making these. But this one is half the price and actually meant to be used one handed. A fine tool. BTW they still make it."
8,"I have a 3 year old english/american bulldog mix that loves chewing on nylabones/dingos. I bought this product selfishly. because I like dinosaurs. Unfortunately. the littel nubs tore into her gums like nobody's business and left sharp shards sticking out. She only had it for a short time under (sort of laxed) supervison. but when i looked down the thing's entire tail was covered in blood. Into the trash it went. Moving forward. I will stick to the non-nubby nylabones."
7,"I read all the positive reviews and was excited about it. Now im excited to replace it with a plastic rain bird sprinklerPros: Solid build. strong material construction. quick performer. very easy to adjust the spray pattern.Cons: It does not have a gasket on the bottom thread so youll need to add some plumber's tape to get a solid seal. It has some overspray that goes beyond the spray pattern which is disappointing if you wanna keep from wasting water. Expensive! At this price. I could have purchased two plastic Rain Bird sprinklers.Other: I recently tested three different impact sprinklers (on video) and so far the best seems to be the plastic rain bird. youll see my video review from youtube this one and the plastic one if you view the plastic one."
8,"my dog like his kibbles more than treats (he LOVES to eat!!). and with this sprinkled on top of his food.he refuses to eat. the smell is super strong even I pull away my head when I open the jar.And. even when i hand fed him the food. he still tried to play with his poop.  (granted. he consumed smaller portion than the recommended by the direction)Overall. it may keep dogs away from their poop because they can smell this in their poop. but that same smell is present on their food. which obviously repells them.So. I do not recommend this product unless your dog eats EVERYTHING."
12,"I saw this game. and it looked amusing. so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun. and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer. 12 or older. rent this game. but do not buy. Most 11 year olds. and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that. you'll go ape over this game."
2,"My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.  I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister. it's just the way it works.  Other than that. the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing. even if the potatoes are a little firm.  If you've never used a ricer before. go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher."
10,".One very usefull little trim saw! Worm drive works very well and seems to handle anything lite. You can not cut a 2x4 with this so don't buy it thinking you can.The only thing porter cable should have done with it is to have provided a box for it. It was designed way back in the 30's or 40's and to this date 2007. they still do not have a box???....A Shame!The saw is much to easy to break or bend if not placed in some kind of case when transporting it. The size of this saw makes it very hard to find just the right size as well....But we have to give the tool itself 5 star because it works very very well!A bit on the 'To high priced side' with out a storage however!"
10,"Still looking for the 'dimmable' option--only found the on/off switch. But essentially the same light as the 'table' model. very bright yet only 3W used. Has a clamp instead of a weighted base. capable of attaching to a table or headboard no larger than 1 and 1/4 in thick. Only assembly req'd was plugging cord into plug. Same perfect black paint as table model. but cannot change bulb--permanent. so must toss entire unit if it ever burns out! Advertised @ 20K hours! We'll see...&#128521;"
11,"I've owned this game for a couple years now and must say it is a great game with good strategy and re-playability.  The graphics and card quality as usual with Fantasy Flight Games is excellent.  The only drawback is that with the cards having a black boarder they are showing some wear and tear with color fading. but as i said I have owned it for a few years and has been in the rotation of the regular games we play that whole time. Overall definitely a card game I would recommend."
3,"Very brief story.  Enjoyable but not a lot to it.  The hero and heroine have been married long enough to fall into a rut.  The husband. a twin. has always wondered whether his wife might have preferred his brother (because the twins had swapped places a couple of times during the married couples courtship because the husband has always felt less socially adept than his twin).  The heroine has always been able to tell the difference between the twins and has never doubted she married the twin that she wanted to marry.  Still. they've settled into comfortableness and she wants passion (and she fears her husband may have strayed --though he hasn't).  Over breakfast she makes an outrageous statement about possibly taking a lover. jolting her loving if inattentive  husband into action.Nice story. Loving couple. It's just a short story. however."
11,"A great family game of storytelling that will keep people amused and stimulate the imagination.The artwork is excellent and whimsical. The components are solid.This game board is a revised edition that goes up to 6 players. There are some improvements. The instructions are now pretty clear from box to board not really requiring combing into the rule book making it quite easy to jump in.There's another version that goes up to 12 players. but all that people voting is overkill and hard to track. 6 is enough."
7,"I have used this to help germinate some cucumbers I started indoors in a small greenhouse tent. At night when the grow lights are unplugged the inside get fairly chilly like the rest of the house. but with this heat mat I can leave it on all night and not have to worry about the seedlings. I would say it keeps the inside temperatures a good 10 degrees warmer than without it. I found the cord to be a little short but it's really no big deal. Before purchasing I compared this with the ones for sale on Gardener's Supply and this seemed to be much better value for the size."
1,"OK. so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store.  Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name. so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results.  I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands. but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again"
12,"This game does not. in fact. star Superman. It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman. Stuporman staggers like a drunken person. relies on power-ups for super powers. pulls punches so enemies beat him. likes random time limits (including ones that lead to an instant game over). can pass through solid objects like they aren't even there. and can die from things that cannot hurt the real man of steel in a million years. like ordinary bullets and explosions. He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Superman's reputation by making him look pathetic and weak. All part of Lex Luthor's evil plan! If you love Superman. don't buy this game. or you'll be buying into a lie!"
2,"It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.  I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one. only to find out it was so poorly designed it'd mangle anything I used it on. and barely peeled anything.  It was so poorly designed. I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it. because it kept catching and slipping.The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled.  There was no catching. or damaging the produce. and it took a lot less time.  I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO."
3,"I liked this one. It wasn't all about the sexy times together. It was really more of a story. which I enjoyed.Christina doesn't trust men. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her brother turned out exactly the same. So. she left but it's left her scarred. She wished more than anything her mother would leave. and can't understand why she doesn't. You sort of knew what was going to happen but it was a bit more surprising than that.I liked it. It was sexy. sweet. and enjoyable."
7,"Over the years I have tried a number of flower pot holders and have always been disappointed with the quality of them. This flower pot holder is made of strong and sturdy steel that is vinyl coated and rust proof so I don't have to worry about rust stains on my deck rails or the holder hanging crooked because of the flower pot weight. It can hold up to 10' flower pots or even several small flower pots so it has great versatility. It was easy to install and looks simple. yet gorgeous. The only thing I didn't like was having to drill my new deck to install the flower pot holder. Overall. it's a great item that's a cut above the rest."
2,"For years. hubby and I have bought Lasko fans to keep in our bedroom.  This is our third one.We use it to keep the air circulating and for the white noise to help me sleep.None of the three that we've owned have had any whining. squeaking. rattling or weird noises.  Just a nice. smooth hum.It does blow hard.The first one died because I let it get too dusty.  The second one lasted for 7 years and I only replaced it because my son needed a fan and I wanted a shiny new one for myself."
6,"A lot of people (myself included) complain about how expensive Avery labels are as compared to the competition. However. what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So. I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better. they're thicker. they block out what is underneath better. and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply. for laser or injet labels. Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for."
6,"I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. On Amazon. even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only. it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them. that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online. (Wish Amazon would do something about that but I suppose they are busy.)So my review for this product? IT WAS A FACTORY SEALED NEW CARTRIDGE just like it said it was. Good place to buy from."
1,"I've been alarmed by the reviews on various sellers' sites saying they had ordered cylindrical and received tapered. I ordered these in August and did receive cylindrical brush tips. as pictured. The wires are pretty weak. and easily bent. but that's unavoidable if it's going to fit into tight spaces. They're supposed to be changed weekly. and I can generally get a week's worth of use out of one. despite having some teeth that are both very close. and slightly crooked. so it's a guessing game inserting the wire at just the correct angle to slide right in.I use a Proxabrush with the conical tip at one end for wide spaces. and the cylindrical one at the other end."
12,"not worth 10 cents. graphics are very poor for nintendo 64 The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick. The aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die. Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring. After level 2 there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it. A much better version of this is availible on the ps1 . definately dont waste any money on this game. it down right sucks"
3,"This book starts off a bit hesitantly--it's the first of a couple dealing with Kasey Johnson and his twin brother Garrett. but it heats up incredibly fast and in such a way as your initial reaction might be. &#34;um. whaaaaaaat?&#34;  Kasey is a second-year professional basketball player obviously playing for the Phoenix Suns--he's a 6'5&#34; blond god who is gay and has not come out. though his equally impressive brother. Garrett. a rising movie star. is openly gay.  There are so many &#34;this is absurd&#34; twists that this book takes which are dealt with brilliantly by author Chase that you actually believe that this stuff can happen. especially today.  You will not forget these characters. including Kasey's devoted seducer and eventually lover. Gram. and you will run right out and get its sequel. High Line. featuring Garrett. as soon as you finish this full court press."
3,"Just finished reading all of Kava's books; they were very good!  I am not a book critic; but what I can say is the entire lot of her books were entertaining and held my interest.  Anytime I pick up a book and read instead of doing something else in my free time is saying something!  Kava. Garnder. Gerritssen. Gagnon what a list of great reads for anyone that enjoys these types of stories....And the bundle provieds the ability to acquire six of her books for a good price!"
6,"The key claim of these labels is that when you are ready to 'peel and stick' them after printing. they are easier to peel off of the backing (the slick sheet that they come on) than other brands are. It's true -- they have simply removed a little bit of paper between each column of labels so that you can fold back the backing paper and easily grasp the edge of each label.If you find existing labels easy to peel off. as I do. there's no reason to get these labels. But if you have to handle hundreds or thousands of labels in a row. the little extra convenience may be worth it.I rated them 4 stars rather than 5 stars only because there is nothing amazing about them."
2,"Take some chocolate milk. cool whip and eagle brand milk.  Mix together and pour in the ICE-20.  In appr. 25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.  Keep excess mixture in frig for later.  It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.  I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.  No salt to rinse out. no ice - just some great. smooth. wonderful ice cream.  After ice cream is made. you just rinse the bowl with hot water. dry and return to the freezer for the next time. The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.  The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.  I have had my ice cream maker for appr. one month and I could not be happier so far."
10,"I use this sander mostly to flatten panels and todress surfaced lumber. and it is *excellent*.It removes material very quickly. and willpull 50 grit on the fastest speed with no bogging down.  Iuse the optional sanding frame. and a vacuum hose. so thebag placement is not an issue for me.  Using the sanding frame.you can get to 120 grit finish very quickly.  Just a touch withthe finish sander using 180 or 220 and you're good to go.This beast is heavy.  Unless you're Arnold SchwarzeneggerI wouldn't consider using this on vertical surfaces.  Onhorizontal surfaces. gravity is your friend. and the weightof the machine does the work.I have a lot of tools.  Most are good. a few are crappy.a few are excellent.  With this sander. every time I use it.I congratulate myself again for coughing up the $$$ and buying it.It has saved me enough time compared to my other beltsander to have paid for itself."
3,"As with The Mister Trophy. I just thought this story was too short.  I really enjoyed reading it and thought it was well done.  My only problem is that there seemed to be the odd article missing and a word or two in it weren't in the Kindle dictionary such as 'haint'. which is a ghost.  I really love the characters. but I think Mama Hog is my favorite.  I recommend this series to anyone who wants a good. but short. fantasy story to read.  I will start on the next one in the series soon."
6,"We've been using those oil-filled sheets that you run through the shredder every so often to lube it up. I found this. at a much. much lower cost. and figured I'd give it a shot. expecting a small bottle of oil similar to ones I've seen at the store. Nope. This is a full-size. 12 oz bottle. which is a LOT of shredder oil. at least for our home use. I figure it will last at least a year. and likely 2-3.Careful cutting off the tip - it's just like a tube of caulk. and if you cut off too much. you'll have a hard time controlling it. Other than that. it's easy to apply. with a nice long nozzle. flows easily. and works great."
12,"This Zelda game is simply amazing! The Wind Waker sucked and Four Swords was OK. but this game rocks! The main plot was spectacular and the gameplay was great! I first played the game after getting Collector's Edition for Christmas. and I was addicted to it. The main plot throughout the whole game is that Link(as a kid) must collect 3 Spiritual stones and open the Door of Time. along with the Ocarina of Time. As an adult. Link must awaken the 5 sages and fight to destroy the evil Ganondorf and rescue Zelda. I have beaten the game 6 times it was so good! I highly recommend it to big Zelda fans. NOTE: This game has a sequel called Majora's Mask. but it's not near as good in my opinion."
8,"the price and size were right to donate to humane society. My cats have refused to switch to purina or whiskas from Blue buffalo. I was seeking to reduce costs but just knew when I saw the big bag that there was no way my cats would eat it.  I had thought it was fancy feast...white cat...gourmet...so when I realized its just a cheaper brand than even the purina ....well. As a donation though it helps Im sure.. The dogs will eat it if the cats wont..at my place the racoons get whatever the cats reject."
2,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder. and frankly I don't use it all that often. My  kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast. making sandwiches. putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel. etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife. I  wouldn't bother. But if  you've got kids. you  might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and  hey. they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
3,"I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate. Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership."
12,"Street Alpha 3 really rocked in the Arcades and when they brough it to the homes of millions on the PSone. it still rocked. it looked great and of course how could you forget the many characters you had to choose from. In total (I want to say) 34 or 35? total characters including hidden characters. A definite up scale from the original Street Fighter Alpha where there's only 8 or 10 characters and 2 of which you could've easily done without (Sodom and Birdie).Also in this one. the special moves changed because now you got to chose which set you wanted which was cool for some characters and detrimental to the success of some of the other characters.I'd still definately get this one because it's that good and even so. how could you not continue to collect the Street Fighter series? PLEASE! You know you want to so go ahead and get it!"
2,"I had never in my life had homemade ice cream until now. my husband and I bought this as a Christmas present to the both of us. we have everything else you can think of but never an ice cream maker. well we are so impressed with the ice cream we can't wait to try other types. It is without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had. and this machine makes it so easy to make. just pour in the ingredients and turn it on. set a timer and you can relax. when it is done transfer the ice cream to a freezer safe container and let it harden and you have the best tasting ice cream ever! Try it. you will love it!"
8,"I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now. tending to get a couple of years of use out of them.  For the price. the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump. it seems reasonable to me.  I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow. is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it.  Those are its pros. along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes).  However. I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning. which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so)."
3,"'SPOILERS'I just got done reading all three books in the Vaughn series that are currently available and enjoyed all three of them.  My main issue with this one however is how quickly Candice gets over her experience of being raped...in one weekend she goes from barely being able to cope with talking to people at the gym. to sleeping with the hero...and it just seems as though it moves a bit too quickly...but the book was a good read and i'm eagerly awaiting the next one in the series due out early next year about their cousin Grace"
8,"Wanted to try on my own to get rid a my cat's tapeworm. I had seen the white pieces of the worm on her rectum. It was 3 pills.  The first one was wasted. mainly my fault.  The second one was given in a really good treat.  I think she ate most of it.  Have not seen any tell-tell signs on her rectum since then so I am assuming it worked.  The delivery was very fast.  I will use them again."
2,"I ordered this lesson plan because I took the first two courses of Wilton's Cake Decorating. and I didn't want to sign up for the 3rd course only because I didn't want to spend so much money for the classes. So I bought the kit in Michaels figuring I would teach myself but this time the lesson plan wasn't included in kit like the first 2 kits were. This lesson plan is great and if you have some experience with working with fondant and gum paste this will be a piece of cake for you. no pun intended. But this definitely isn't for a beginner."
12,"Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them. The Developer. Naughty Dog had a great idea. and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay. the graphics. the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds. such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love. Oombadegha!"
1,"These are expensive for daily use. I'd recommend NiMH rechargeables for that. but they're perfect for low temperature use (car flashlight in Minnesota winter. digital camera use outdoors in the winter) when both alkalines and NiMHs fail to deliver. These would also be. with very gradual storage loss. great for an emergency electronic device. Maybe for GPS or LED flashlight. Do check that your electronics are happy with these batteries installed. I've heard of both digital cameras and GPS units (Garmin GPS60) that did not."
11,"My 11 yo nephew was wide-eyed as he dramatically told me how it was &#34;proven&#34; that the elf moved. etc.  After that. I couldn't not buy it for him for Christmas.  He was so excited when he opened it!  I read through the book (which I thought was pretty goofy. but if the kids like it. then who am I to judge?) and it at least explained the whole concept.  I know many people think that this elf idea is creepy. but I have seen so many who have had fun with it. too.  It seemed to be well made. and the boxed-set made it a wonderful presentation for gift-giving."
8,"Program is the safest long lasting flea treatment for pets-- I used to work in a veterinary hospital and I have seen many cats have serious reactions to  Advantage and Frontline. which are topical pesticides.Read the inserts for Advantage and Frontline. it says that they are NOT safe for sick animals. young kittens. etc. etc. My cat is allergic to both Frontline and Advantage. Frontline gave him a lump in his neck and Advantage gave him a bald spot where I applied it. and he kept trying to lick the spot.Program is super safe-- you can put it in a dish and mix it with tuna and your cat will eat it right up. You can use it with Capstar (also super safe. but not long lasting) to kill live fleas if your cat picks one up. This is the best monthly flea control to keep your cat safe and healthy! I have used it for almost a decade and I will not use any other product on my cat."
12,"If you own the N64 then you must have this game. The graphics are a bit out dated. but who cares! The game is still great! Even though there are less characters than the newer smash bros this game still brings in the punches. You can play story/one player mode and also play up to 4 people.In one player mode you can either do the story mode or do the challenges. Both are fun! You can set up the difficulties and also set up how many lives you can use.Multiplayer mode is also fun. You have the ability to play in teams or not. Still you can set up the difficulties. PLUS. you can have a time battle or set up how many lives you can use.Though unlike mele you can't plat story mode with 2 players... but that shouldn't be the reason for not getting this game!"
5,"I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar. and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S. and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break. I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all. I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and 'stretch' for few days playing. it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months. they still are playable. and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings."
12,"This isn't a particularly deep product. They are wire extenders to be used for the Nintendo Gamecube controllers. They come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price. They extend approximately 6 feet in length. and with the already fairly long wire on the Gamecube controller already. these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room. I have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller. Getting these beats paying the higher price for the Wavebird wireless Gamecube controllers. I'm on a budget so I'll just stick with a wired controller. no big deal."
2,"From now on. I'll always look for a Lasko 3733 when I need to replace a fan. I bought my first one 5 years ago and it ran 24/7 365 days a year. It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out. FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced. It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like. but then again. I want perfection and that's not going to happen. It  is quiet enough on the slow setting. and making a fan spin faster does nothing to move air faster (believe it or don't. this is pure physics).Cleaning of this fan is very easy. Simply remove the grill screws. then remove the grills. Then unscrew the blade holder. and pull the blades off the spindle. Wash in hot. soapy water. Replace everything. then turn it on so that it drys itself."
6,"If you have a list of mailings to send and are ready to print address labels you'll want reliable label sheets.  That's what Avery offers with this item.  Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes.  This item contains enough labels to last awhile.  These kinds of labels can be used for a variety of projects. not just for mailing addresses.  Avery is a leader in offering convenient office supplies - this address label package is one of many of their offerings that you'll find useful."
11,"Arkham Horror is a hard game to win. but it is a lot of fun! It can also be quite long. Adding expansions adds to the fun. especially more monsters. investigators. items and spells. Not all expansion rules and boards need to be used. however. This is a neat game. as you move around the board attempting to increase your investigator's power. defeating monsters. and closing gates (which spew forth more monsters if you don't close them). Meanwhile. a slumbering Ancient One of great evil gets closer and closer to waking up - and then all investigators do battle with 'It'!This is a very cool game."
5,"I actually have five of these for the various instruments. mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric.When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very. very solid. While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners. I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength. You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete. and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model.The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic. There are variants for other instruments. but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable. and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully."
1,"These cartridges are somewhat pricey. This fluid keeps my Braun razor working perfectly. I think it is now about five years old. and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time. so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life. I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy."
10,"I purchased the plane even after reading the bad reviews. I have own many Stanley planes some antiques and son giving to me by my grandfather. I have always been very happy with them. So. I purchased this rabbet planer with the purpose of cleaning up the middle ridge made by a dado. When I first got the plane. like you need to do with all planes. I tuned it and adjusted it. The plane works great. I have been using it with no problems. It did take a bit of time to adjust. If you are not sure on how to adjust the plane or the tuning of it. you can e-mail Stanley's service department and they will be glade to mail out the information on the model you have. I would and more then likely will purchase other Stanley plane in the future. I gave this four stars because nothing is perfect."
8,"This product has better ingredients at a better price than some lesser quality foods. I'm still debating making my own dog food. They suggest not giving dogs table food. but cheaper dog food typically costs $1/pound. I have a difficult time purchasing food for my family that's $1/pound (we eat A LOT of chicken for that reason). Chicken is currently $0.49/pound. Homemade dog food is looking very cost effective these days. Either way. apples to apples. this is a reasonable purchase. It doesn't cause my dog flatulence like some other brands."
10,"Freud SS100 Dado Shim SetThis product does what it says it does. Is it really necessary? Probably not. In order to size a dado precisely. you measure to approximate the set of dado blades used to the desired width. Then you start cutting test grooves in scrap stock and adding or change shim thicknesses and cutting another test. Depending on your skill and luck. you may get it right in several tries.It is just as effective to select the dado blade set. with no shims.  for a groove a little undersize. Then make a slight rabbet cut on the inserted board (shelf) to fit the dado. like fitting a tenon to a mortise. Use a piloted rabbet bit in a router to make the fitting cut. Once adjusted to depth. you can repeat the process accurately as many times as the project requires.I bought the shim set because I thought I was missing something. but I probably will not use it much."
11,"I purchased this game as a kind of &#34;D&D; in-a-box&#34; purchase to play with friends. and it was a big hit.Pros:Lots of characters and class options-The adventures are fun and engaging-Easy to learn-Excellent miniatures and artCons:-Fairly basic as far as gameplay goes. not alot of thought involved.-Campaigns are artificially stretched by the &#34;reinforcement&#34; mechanic that lets you constantly add more enemies to the stage-Requires someone to be the &#34;overlord&#34; which no one wants to be."
8,"I really like this launcher.  It works really well. but I'm thinking of someday buying the longer one.  I opted on this one as the long one indicated it threw farther.  I didn't want to launch it so far I'd lose the ball or end up chasing my dog to get him to come back. so for the length of the throw is perfect and it's very easy to snatch the ball up for continued throwing.  My significant other is 6'1&#34; so he has to do some bending to pick up the balls which is okay for him. but the intention had been to make it easier for him.  One thing I've noticed is that this does not put the stress on my shoulder that thowing by hand thowing does.  This makes our dog. Diego. very happy because he can play and play and play."
7,"This has been my best 'Squirrel Proof' Feeder to date and I now have six various kinds of feeders meant to keep out the 'grey hoards'.  When filled with mixed seed it also attracts the greatest variety of birds of any feeder I own. particularly Eastern Cardinals. Is VERY heavy when fully loaded and I found that hanging it is more secure than using the included pole. You MUST use a long and sturdy hanger to keep squirrels from hanging onto a branch or tree trunk and bypassing the weight triggered closing mechanism. Will keep out at least 90% of your Squirrels which usually content themselves to forage on seeds dropping to the ground below the feeder."
7,"CobraCo's adjustable flower pot holder is a flexible product that can be used to fit on deck railing up to 4 inches across.  The brackets easily attach in 1 of 2 configurations depending on the width of your rail.  There are 3 screws on each side to lock the bracket down.  There is a bottom bumper support to rest against a post or rail to keep the plant level.  The holder easily accommodates a plant pot of up to 10 inch diameter.This is an easy way to beautify your deck.  Just add plant. and water."
11,"Robots will no doubt become a big part of society. they will do tasks that we deem to be too dangerous or Dirty and the ReCon 6.0 is a very good toy to get your kids started in learning how to program Robots and see the results of their efforts.  I would recommend this for children between the ages of 8-12 years old because it does require a certain amount of discipline in math. problem solving. spatial awareness and programming so it's win win toy!My only complaints would be the lack of a Remote control. it would be nicer if the code could be edited without accessing the Robot at ground level and it would be nice if it also moved a little faster.Overall I find this to be an extremely educational toy that will make a child more interested in what is sure to be a huge job market area in the next 20 years."
3,"I have read most of this author's books. I simply love. love. love the Westmoreland family series and their wonderful heroines/heros/loves. The Westmoreland men and the few Westmoreland women are each. in their own right. riveting characters. Although they're all extremely manly/womanly. there's no fear in expressing their feelings! Emotions are always expressed. no matter the situation whatever it is. The emotions consistently pour! Again. I love. love. love the Westmoreland Clan. Keep'em coming Brenda as I love you as one of my very favorite authors too."
10,"This toolbox is made of solid metal. which is pretty nice because plastic stuff breaks eventually.  This thing feels solid.  It has a nice top drawer that you can pull out.  I use this as my toolbox between going between my two houses. I keep a small cordless drill and its charger. some caulk. a level. a hammer. drill bit set. safety goggles. utility blade. small flashlight. tape measure. a bunch of screws and nails of various lengths and maybe a few other small things that I'm forgetting (ahh. pliers and a couple of screwdrivers).  It is a little bit of an exercise to get all of this into this relatively small tool box. but I actually like the small size of it.  Easy to pack into the car. sturdy. etc.  For the simple user. it is perfect.  If you're a pro. you probably need one of the metal boxes with drawers."
3,"This book was a recent Kindle Daily Deal and I decided to take a flyer on it. While I like anthologies. ones as topical as this one aren't what I usually read. So I had my doubts about how I'd like it.But the gamble paid off well; I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. The stories range from touching to humorous. While I'm usually not a fan of 'country humor' (who can compare to Twain?). the humorous stories in this book weren't bad. The non-humorous ones were pretty good.Even though I wasn't raised in the South. all of my extended family was and many of these stories reminded me of my childhood when I used to spend time there."
7,"Expensive hunk of junk.  Orig. purchase date Nov. 2006. after the first one we'd bought quit working just a little after the warranty period ended.  The 'head' on this Defender has been repaired three times and replaced twice.  If you get a replacement head from them. there is no additional warranty past your original purchase date (even though they sent you a new one!).  Save your money for something else.  Ours is dead again.  We purchased an inexpensive replacement plan through Amazon. but we're done with the Defender-we're throwing it away."
7,"The Good:  These skewers are perfect. much better than traditional round ones and infinitely better than wooden ones.  For everyone who has ever had the frustration of trying to turn your food on the grill only to have the skewer turn inside the food and the food stay stuck to the grill. these wide rectangular skewers are perfect.  They are very long and very durable as well.  I have cooked numerous meals with them to include beef. vegetables and chicken.  Every one came out perfect and I never had a problem with the skewer sliding around inside the food itself.The Bad:  Even though these are stainless steel. after cooking with them and washing them off they rusted.  I quickly solved this problem with a Brillo pad and before I put the skewers away in the drawer. I coated them with a very light coat of olive oil.  Problem solved."
11,"Party Gras is fun from the start. It doesn't take more than a minute to get going. Players ask each other questions and depending on responses take or give up beads. Because you play one category per card. then discard. the options are open. Everyone in our family enjoyed the game. which can go as long or short as you like.It's more fun to play in the background while you're doing something else. because some of the prompts fit into life on the go. Otherwise. some of the prompts are engineered for the dare or refusal. It plays well during a party going on. dinner.  or video watching. You don't necessarily learn about other players. except how you enjoy the interaction."
5,"I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin. but for more chord strumming style playing. such as playing rhythm. the .73's are perfect. They are flexible. but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However. they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So. i dont see how you can go wrong."
3,"I found the story of Kasey and Gram to very romantic. with a sprinkling of good sex scenes.  Kasey has fallen in love for the first time; he has to decide if he will out himself and possibly derail his professional basketball career.  Gram a very tasty night club owner wants to be with Kasey in any capacity he can; he loves Kasey and is willing to stay in the background to preserve his career.  The sex scenes were a little tame for my tastes. but I will definitely read this again when I'm in the mood for romance. Enjoy!I have to admit that I was more interested in Kasey's twin brother Garrett.  Garrett is fun loving. dangerous. and quite a handful I've already downloaded his story 'The Love of Sports Series. Book 2'."
1,"I've been taking this every day for a couple of months now. I'm not 100% sure it's doing anything. but I like the idea of taking an antioxidant every day. Others I've tried in the past gave me noticeable side effects. This is the only one that hasn't. so I'll keep taking it.Can't speak to the skin benefits because I don't have a lot of wrinkles in the first place. My skin does look better overall. but I'm doing some topical things to it as well."
7,"While not as strong as a trowel made of metal. Fiskars 7978 Composite Trowel is still strong enough to handle basic gardening tasks.  Made out of a composite plastic called `FiberComp'. the tool is very lightweight.  The blade is oversized. quite wide. and appears to be quite sturdy.  The rock solid handle is probably the strongest part of the tool. and snapping the blade off would take a great deal of force.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if not abused. it should last for a long while.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
2,"The OXO 'Good Grips' Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.  It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.  Flip the zester over and there is a narrow row of 5 or 6 small round holes that (with some pressure) create nice thin short strips of lemon zest.  This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.  It's not the fastest zester. but it's a lot simpler to clean after using. compared to any larger screen-type grater."
12,"The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable). but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics. then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit. but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money."
10,"Being a construction worker and a tool fanatic I must say this is the best saw on the market. At least 80 percent of constuction sites are occupied by the HD77 or it's brother the MAG77. I like the HD77 alittle better due to it's weight. I have yet to experience any heavy kickback and have yet to find any piece of lumber this won't rip through. This is a easy tool to use if you can handle a little weight (it doesn't take that long to get used to if you use lighter saws). This saw can handle being dropped several times and will last forever with an occasional oil. I don't have enough good things to say about this great saw."
11,"I have three kids. and there are a lot of kids that come in and out of this house.  Pretty much every kid is attracted to this toy at first. but many kids move on quickly.  However; the older kids that are electronically oriented love this toy.  My 12 year old nephew. in particular. couldn't get enough of this.  He programmed it to bring a treat to the dog. to bring a drink to his dad. and the pacifier to his brother.  He plays with it every time he comes over.  I love that we have a toy he is interested in that isn't a video game.  I definitely caution you to heed the age warning. it takes a fair amount of attention span and desire. but for the right kid.  it is perfect!"
7,"It was a little smaller than I expected. but that was actually a plus in my book. It feels durable and I like the fact that there is not a bug tray for collecting dead bugs. If you were using this on your deck or something. may that would be a different story. but you are really not supposed to use it where you will be sitting anyway. I sprinkled a pile of dietamaceous earth underneath this on the ground so that any crawling bugs like ants that come to feast on the new fried bug bits will meet their demise as well."
12,"The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that. this is a very solid effort."
7,"I've been using this to keep plants alive during the frost. I didn't think they could grow anymore because of the cold. This thing makes them grow! I was surprised. The plants went from about 12 inches tall to about 18 inches. I keep the light on for about 16 hours a day. and if it's warm enough outside I put them out there on a roller.My only con is that the frame could be built better. other than that it's great if you have a few plants you need to keep alive during the winter. It's good even if you want to start plants."
2,"After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up. we were looking for an appropriate replacement.  Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors. there were a few critical criteria.  It had to be strong. yet compact in size.  It should not be too loud. and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items.  Finally. we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers.  The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts.  It produces a powerful vacuum. easily maneuverable. convenient for storing. the noise is not too bad. and a good price.  This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value. and. certainly. gets the job done that we bought it for."
11,"You really don't need to know anything about D&D to play this game. As with all good games. there's a lot of variety in play decisions and lots of strategies to go for depending on the cards you get. With each person having a hidden 'role' to give them a potential bonus at the end. it's hard to tell who is winning. I think the builder role card is a bit too rewarding. but it is what it is. I just hate being the only one going after 'the builder' to keep them from getting points. because i tend to not be able to adapt a winning strategy for myself. The play is pretty straight-forward and limiting the number of rounds makes you consolidate your moves. though it does tend to lend to over analyzation. so if you have &#34;those&#34; kind of players in your gaming group. you may need to prod them every now and then. Fun to play with variety."
7,"I've used the 'vaporizer' twice and love it!  I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring; it doesn't take much to fry them plus. on a cold day. the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty.  I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all. the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered.  Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames.  Otherwise. a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt."
1,"Wish I'd known about this product in my 20s. Now that I'm in my 40s. I find that the hormonal changes are making UTIs something I need to be vigilant about again. after many years without them. I alternate between taking one of these at bedtime. & a daily tsp of D-mannose as a preventive measure. The mannose absorbs & carries away bacteria & the Cystex has a disinfecting action. so a multi-pronged approach. However. for travel these are a good deal less trouble than mannose which is a white powder. I have not had a single UTI in the 6 months I have been using this. I also give one to my elderly collie twice a week as she has developed the same issue. =o)  At least we're in this menopausal adventure together."
5,"As old strings slowly start to stretch and wear out. you hardly notice the sound quality deteriorate. But it's important to replace them every month or two. even if you hear no problem with the current strings. Playing on fresh strings is the best experience ever!These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold. The crisp and solid vibration is just top notch! Probably better than any other light strings I've bought. They needed to be tuned often before they settled in. but all new strings do. I haven't used them long enough to give a review on how well they hold up. but I'll be updating in a month or so. So far. they are great. Definitely recommended!"
1,"shaving almost daily for 30+ years now and tried most brands cartridge or disposable.atra was a great blade my worst experience the schick intuition plus.any of the mens mach3 blades a mug. brush and shaving soap is all you will needfor what may be one of life's finest pleasures...Closest shave on this planet. like silk baby!excellent blades. cost and experience for precision quick shavers..no man could ever beat our timing and terrain girlsmake sure you only buy your blades from amazon. don't get ripped upwith bootleg blades around here.blow dry them or place razor in a cup or stand at least(keep them clean/dry)for blade life.no goosebumps or forget about it. turn up the heat please.as for fusion and proglide i love them/but they are costly and mach3 willgive you the fine bare shave you desire for less."
5,"I bought these primarily because they are so cheap. The quality is good I would say - not great. but not terrible either. They sound great for a few weeks but then become very dull. They don't last nearly as long as Elixirs. but then again. they are a lot cheaper than Elixirs. I would recommend these for practice - no gigging with these as the sound isn't quite as crisp as I would think a performer would want. For the price though. it's hard to knock on them too much."
11,"This is a great strategy and action game that is highly thematic. Essentially this is a cooperative game where the players are supposed to be working together. except that at least one player will end up being a traitor and nobody knows if it will be when the game starts or if it will come halfway through the game. The traitor tries not to be detected while subtly sabotaging the efforts of the human players to win the game. If the Cylon gets discovered then they can be even more deadly be directly throwing obstacles into the path of the human players who are trying to survive. There is a lot of tension as accusations fly and bids for power are made between the Admiral. President. and other characters in the game. What happens if the President or Admiral are secretly Cylons? What if they are both Cylons? Run through this game to find out for yourself. Every play feels like an episode of this great sci-fi adventure."
3,"I do not write reviews as often as I should. however. after attempting to read this bundle. I had to review.  I have never read anything that contained more adjectives than these books.  It was absolutely unbearable. I could tell that this author had writing talent.  The story flowed well and made sense.  I found myself scanning more than reading because I couldn't deal with the overly flowery writing style.  If that type of writing is not your style. you will want to skip these books.  Following is a small example of the nonstop adjective use in these books...A bitter mountain breeze wrapped around his long frame. whipping his shaggy hair against the furrowed ridges of his brow as Jeremy Burns hiked through the Maryland forest. Like a wrathful banshee. the relentless autumn winds howled with fury. while his fellow Bloodrunner. Cian Hennessey. quietly kept pace at his side.arrrggghhhAfter reading authors like JR Ward. this type of stuff made my eyeballs roll to the back of my head."
12,"This was the first 'Kart' game quite like this.. there isn't any 'Kart' game like this either outside of the Mario franchise. If you think you can find a better Karting game out there. I'd like to see you find it and show me. because from my finds and plays. this is the only game that is worth playing. From DK to Bowser. Peach to Toad. this game has most of the characters that have been involved with Mario in some way. The graphics are great for its time. the sound is fun. the worlds are colorful. the idea is great. Who wouldn't like this game- at ANY age? I'm not sure. but if you don't. you amy need to see a doctor. This is the best Kart game ever. and the best Mario Kart game ever."
11,"I hadn't played Boggle in decades and then my dear friend brought out her original boggle set and we started playing all the time.  I was so excited to get my own and therefore bought this one.  I really enjoy it and how it stimulates my brain.  What I also love about it is that my 7 yr old loves it!!  The first time he played he only saw one word. but he didn't give up and now he can find up to ten.  He's even finding words I didn't!  This game is fun and educational.  My family plays it at least weekly."
8,"Got this along with a few other toys a few weeks ago. This was clearly my dog's last choice. In fact. I didn't think he'd play with it at all. Eventually he started messing with it. so I was pretty thrilled. Of course. after a few days. he'd ripped some of the limbs open and stuffing was coming out. Overall. not one of his favorite toys. and doesn't seem very durable. The only squeaker in this thing is right in his stomach and it's hard to get to. I'm not even sure my dog even figured out it was in there. heck. I had trouble getting it. Get something else. Nothing special about sock monkey."
11,"I purchased this for my four year old (2 1/2 years ago) and when I was pregnant. we decided to write a book for the baby.  The first misstep was that Grandma let the 4 year old open this up on his own and scribble all over the two 'cover's.  So. our cover is a total scribble fest.  When I tried to order a new cover sheet. the online cost was $.20  totally reasonable.  But. they would not give you a PDF file so you could print it. you are required to have it shipped to you for $5.  Then. there are quite a few rules/guides/limits about how many words and drawing with only the provided markers within the box.Why not have your child draw pictures. photograph them and make a photo book at shutterfly or other photo site?  That would be much more flexible and easier. if you ask me..."
8,"This has 6 applications. where you use this on your dog once every month for 6 months during the summer months.  It helps to kills fleas and ticks that might get on your dog.  No dog should be left outside all day in the summer. because there is a bigger chance of your dog to get fleas and ticks.  Take them for walks. and let them out with you. but don't keep them out in the yard all day.  They need water. and air conditioning is nice!!!!"
5,"After you have used this tool for the first time. you say to yourself....&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there. winding forever by hand. With this winder. you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts. that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;. I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all."
10,"I had a Porter Cable 19.2 volt drill with a light but evetually my batteries went bad so I bought a Milwaukee 18 volt hammer drill/saw combo. I missed having the flashlight so I bought the Milwaukee light to go with my batteries. I like this light even better than the Porter Cable becuse the on/off switch is so much easier to use especially with gloves on. I highly recommend the light to anyone who had Milwaukee cordless tools because it is well built and very bright. The battery provides a stable base for it to sit on and the pivoting head makes it easy to shine the light where you need it. It is another great tool from Milwaukee."
8,"My cats love this and even my older 17 yr old cat which passed in 2012 was spunkier after eating this for a few weeks.  When I could see the difference. I knew there was something to this.  They eat the tuna and salmon flavor.  One bowl of this along with one of the flat cans of moist Friskies food split between each cat is what was the guaged right amount for my two cats per day.  They nibble on the dry cat food throughout the day. and look forward to the fresh moist food each morning and by the evening. it's gone.  Any more is too much; less will render lots of complaints with loud meows before the evening's done."
6,"I find the Avery labels the easiest to use.  Every software package I've ever attempted has the Avery Label templates already built in. and the labels peel off easily. and stay stuck to the envelope during mailing.I like to use the Return Address size labels for many different uses: pricing items for a garage sale. file folders (yes. they make file folder labels. but I'm frugal). labeling books and DVDs. and I also would use them if sending bottles/baby items to a daycare facility.I am a very frugal shopper. but when it comes to labels I feel Avery's quality justifies the price.  I would recommend Avery brand labels to anyone!"
8,"When our dog plays with this thing she throws it in the air and when it lands it sounds like she just threw a brick.  Minus the loud nature of this toy it is great. our dog is a powerful chewer and she can put bite marks into it but that's about all.  We have had this toy for about 5 months and it is still intact but with hundreds of bite marks in it.  I would strongly recommend NOT stepping on this.  Overall this is a durable toy that our dog loves."
3,"Girl meets boy and they get married. Nevertheless. the author writes quite well which made it more interesting to me; however. the constant interruptions that she included to keep the main couple apart got irritating! Also.if I had realized that she would include explicit gross sex scenes. I probably never would have chosen this book as I don't think her first book was so overly sexual. I prefer Anne Perry.s type of writing about both love and the customs of 18th century England. Or more like Jane Austin."
5,"I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked. but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them. between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut. works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly. the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). But otherwise. worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!)."
6,"I had gotten my first TI calculator in 6th or 7th grade. My TI-83+ has survived about 10 years of being dropped. thrown in frustration. left in hot/cold cars. etc. I bought this calculator for a finance class so that I could enter the calculations I need as they are taught in class rather than figuring it out on my graphing calculator. The first thing I noticed are the keys aren't nearly as good and are kind of annoying to press.  The case isn't very solid at all. I get the feeling if I were to drop it that would be the end of this calculator. As for actual calculation it has been fine so far. but you need to change decimal settings. Out of box it rounds to 2 places. which is inadequate. I recommend setting it to 5."
7,"You won't find a better way to start your coals for the Webber Smokey Mountain cooker.  Following directions I had half of the coals I needed nice and white hot for my cooker in about 10 minutes.  It is built better than the ones I have seen at Ace Hardware and other places.  There is an inverted cone grill at the bottom that enables the starter to have more surface area for the newspaper sheets that you use to get the thing started.  You will not be sorry you ordered this along with your WSM cooker!"
7,"You can tell these are quality grills; otherwise Weber wouldn't give these a 10 year warranty. My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."
11,"When we first opened the box. we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully. we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people. the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this. Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
7,"We bought the Garden Claw several years ago at our first house and never used it. because the handles are mounted for lefties.  That is. the two hand-grips are each curved to the side. giving a feel of turning a wheel when you use it.  This would be great if you put your hands on the grips and turned it to the right to dig.  But the tines on this gadget are positioned so that you have to 'steer' the Claw to the left to get them to dig.  Since us righties have more strength in our right hands. it was very awkward to 'steer' the Claw to the left.  We spent about 20 minutes with it in the garden that day and haven't used it since."
5,"This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz. distorions. auto wah. a compressor. octaver. bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to 'recuperate' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity. definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!"
11,"Players start the game by drawing cards which give them train routes across the US they should aim to create.  During the game. they create train routes. earning points for each segment created. plus bonus points for completing a designated route.  It's a strategy game with a dose of luck.  But compared to Ticket to Ride Europe. it is less cutthroat. and harder to thwart other players.  The game is fairly predictable. but fun and appropriate for both adults and children. groups of up to five as well as two players.  It's also good for those who want exposure to U.S. geography.  A fun. well-made game.  Recommended."
1,"This big pack was a huge problem solver for us.  We don't have a car so we navigate the shopping chores carefully.  We are within walking distance of many different stores and we do have a hardware store nearby but the usual purchase of a regular box was used quickly which meant constantly walking to the hardware store for refills.  Buying these has been a big relief for me. since I do most of the walking.  I am still using these and it has been MONTHS.  I will do this every time. The price is not painful and the large number of bags makes it a real deal."
3,"This is Maris Mackenzie's story. She is working as a horse trainer for a prestigious owner in Kentucky and wakes up one morning to find herself in bed with a man she doesn't know. Maris finds herself in the middle of an investigation involving insurance fraud but realizes she's met the man she's going to marry.While Maris' journey to the altar is a short one. what's engaging about the story is when she and Alex MacNeil return to Ruth. Wyoming to meet the MacKenzie clan. It's an opportunity to check in on the other members of the family and watch Alex face the wrath of five brothers who question his motives.It is an entertaining story and any excuse to revisit MacKenzie Mountain makes it worthwhile."
11,"Love the idea of these bookmarks (we have two) and they're pretty great. but not perfect.  I don't have the instructions (as I recall. they arrived. we tore into the packaging-- don't think we saved the paperwork). so it could be there's a solution to this that I don't know of.  But the issue I have is that you can't tell that they're on unless you stare long enough to see the minute click over.  It shows seconds for a while. but once you've read a certain amount. they're no longer there.  Just a little indicator that showed it was counting would make a big difference.  On such a simple concept. that makes the difference between 4 and 5 stars for me.Otherwise. we've used them for a couple of weeks now and so far. so good."
1,"I have had this brush for over two years now and I use it constantly. The colored end bristles are a little stiffer then the white ones so it's great for the bottom of jars especially the ones you have to clean for recycling. Makes hard work a breeze. After extreme daily use it still looks brand new. I just put it in a glass with bleach and water every so often to keep it nice and fresh. I purchased two and the other one is still under the sink with the tag still on it because I just can't wear this thing out! I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought one for a friend who looked at me like I was insane when I raved about it and now she tells all her friends to get one too! Get this brush. it is an amazing very well made cleaning tool!"
12,"This game is pretty entertaining for the first couple weeks that you have it.  After that is doesn't really have much to offer.  The game just gets really easy to beat and extremely repetitive with all the says of the various characters.  Although the characters. with names like Slippy and Peppy. give some extra flavor to this boring game.  Multiplayer mode is just plain bad.  All of the escape moves make it too easy to dodge your opponents fire. so the game takes forever. and the multiplayer levels themselves offer you nothing interesting.  This game does have it's value for a little while so if you want to try it then rent it. don't waste your money buying it."
10,"I'm dumbfounded that after all of these years. DeWalt still hasn't corrected the ongoing problem with the flexible neck being too wimpy to hold up the light for very long. I thought. jeez the most recent review looks to be 2011. there should be an improvement by now... lol. nope. I finally removed the thing. got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck. stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand. problem solved for now. I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes. bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag."
2,"My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan. so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog. A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time. so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe. because it can be a pain to clean. especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still. it's not too difficult. and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it."
1,"I bought these for a digital camera which went through alkalines every 30 photos. After researching how alkalines drop to about 1.2 volts after very little use and then level out from there I learned that these lithiums maintain the 1.5 volts for a much longer period of use and consequently allow my camera to continue to work through about 120 to 150 photos. I also use these in the outside unit of my weather station because they will not fail at subzero temperatures like alkalines do. The added cost is worth it in some instances but probably not for general use."
2,"I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product. but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit. finish. and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating."
5,"I ordered this product to use for personal recording. and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it 'New.' and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First. the package was stapled. that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then. to make matters worse. there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new. I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
3,"***spoilers alerts***The writing was easy enough to get through and was not dragged on and on by overly descriptive scenery. The town. its people were interesting. but as a reader you hardly had time to get to know anyone. Though I wanted to fall in love with the hot Burke. I felt like he wasn't macho enough to mark HIS mate on his own. That's the only conclusion I could think of that required his brothers' involvement in marking Rachel by them all. And after having told her sex wasn't required to mark her.Though the love scenes were hot. I found the fact that he shared her with his brothers distasteful. Not my thing. The only reason I'd consider reading another book of the series is because I'm curious about the other types of shifters."
6,"This simple calculator seems to work fine. as advertized.  I docked it a star because I wasn't able to find a function for integrations or higher order functional analysis. but I suppose you can't have everything in a five dollar calculator.It also lacks voice control. has little or no artificial intelligence. and in general makes a very poor companion if you're stuck alone with it on a desert island.  It does break the ice at parties with the classic 58008 joke. but only the most sophisticated of users are able to appreciate the humor."
10,"first i must say this is the only mortiser i have used.the machine was easy to set up 10 minutes from box to running. i got a free jet chiesel set with purchase.the first thing i played with was popular cut sweet. next scrap cherry a cake walk(1/4 mortise made) .the only thing i see is seal the base(which is mdf) . i ordered chiesels from lee valley for the dresses project i got this for.saw final word for the average woodworker/weekend warrior a+ machineoh yes as stated before i got free chiesels. free prime delivery fast and well packaged. good price and a stellar toy.if you dont have one put on your bucket list ."
8,"I found this to be the best bargain for a higher quality dog food. comparable to Wellness and Blue Buffalo. My dogs both love it and one of my dogs that often gets topical yeast infections does not have problems on this food so its not full of bread filler. The only other food comparable for my dog's yeast problem is Wellness and it got too pricy for me.  I did notice a salmonella recall on the Diamond lamb flavor. spring of 2012. so I keep an alert on my google news.  but its the only recall I've seen and it went public fast. right on the Diamond site and there were no fatalities because it was dealt with well.  Still. good to know."
7,"I thought that a plastic quick connect might turn out to be cheesy. but I gave them a try anyway.After only one month at the end of a light duty hose. the male end just snapped in half. The plastic sheared in half at the middle of the fitting with the male end still engaged into the female snap. Yup. it was under normal water pressure but it wasn't like I was using the hose as a tow rope. or pumping benzene through it.I've had both brass and aluminum hose quick connects wear out over the years. but never snap in half like that.Next time I'll listen to that little voice."
5,"As stated. I use the D'Addario 9s and 10s on all my electric guitars except for theGibson LP's and I use Brite wires on those.I like the D'Addario's over the Brite wires because they have color coded balls and thismakes changing out all the strings at once a lot easier.I do not produce a lot of body acid. so strings last a very long time with me. no matterwho the manufacturer is. and I play many guitars in my collection so none of them gets heavyuse.The EXL strings produce great tone. and are great for bending."
11,"This is a fun brain burner - on the lite side.  We love the way the game plays (120 equally sized pieces. each consisting of two joined hexes. come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that make up the piece - some pieces have two identical symbols. some have two different symbols (not unlike dominoes). The goal of the game is. through clever placement. to obtain points in the different symbol colors. Points are claimed by placing a piece such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol.)  This is a game that all the kids can play. though with adults. the strategies can become subtle and challenging.  Loads of fun!!"
8,"My male cat has a lot of allergies.  I've tried using many products to boost his immune system and add luster to his coat.  I also happen to show dogs and use the Nupro Gold on my show line of animals with great results so I decided to try cat nuggets.  WONDERFUL.  At first my male cat wasn't to keen on eating it. the female gobbled it down.  After a few days he ate it fine.  I just sprinkle a 1/2 teaspoon on their individual breakfast.  You can also mash it up into can food.  Male cat no longer has the runs. coat looks amazing. and no allergy issues taking this supplement.  (He's allergic to grain and certain cat litters).  Female cat also looks amazing but she never had much of an issue looking fab!"
6,"I've been using Mead notebook paper since I was a kid in school. It's a really good standby.Nowadays I really like to use it as stationery. I cut off the red lines. and then cut down by about five lines from the top to get a good-sized lined piece of paper that can be jazzed up with rubber stamps. Additionally. I also use it a backing paper with nice stationery. so that I don't use more than one sheet of nice stationery for a letter--I use the nice piece as the first page. and these cut to size for other sheets. Either way. it helps save money while creating lined stationery. (Yes. I'm someone who still writes letters!)Whichever use you're getting it for--stationery or school--this basic pack is a generous size with 200 sheets."
3,"I was going to give four stars. but this newspaper and the subscription experience really couldn't be any better.  My expectations were low based on old reviews. but it looks like everything is worked out now.  There are sufficient graphics. plenty of good content. with the bylines you'd expect.  Okay. cartoons. comics. and crosswords would be nice. but I can forgive the omission.  In fairness. I've only been reading the paper for a few days. so maybe there will be delivery problems in my future.  If so. I'll update this review.  But so far so good.  I'm considering a move to Austin. and I expect to learn a lot about the area by reading the local paper.  This is a really good small newspaper."
8,"I rated this product as I did because it may have a little dust but not near as much as others I have used... The price is right on this product being it is delivered in 2 days to my door... I choose the 14 lb box as my litter box is upstairs and it's a pain to haul the bigger boxes up the steps... One other thing I find the smaller box good for is storing the used litter until I fill the box.... I can then carry the used litter downstairs to dispose.... I wash the litter box a couple times a month and 14 lbs fill it nicely... My cats are not picky about scented or unscented and I have used both with good results..."
11,"We had a big family game night last week and I broke out the new Scene It Comedy edition.  It featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the DVD which was included.  The game board can also be expanded for longer games.  About 10 of us played the game and most of us were confused by the questions.  I have never heard of a lot of the movies that were included.  All in all. unless you are a complete comedy movie buff. I do not recommend.  I have played other Scene It Games in the past and enjoyed them - I think I just wasn't into the Comedy Movies that were included."
3,"This book was below average. There was no build up to Angie and Ryan. He says 'come home with me' and she agrees. When Wade was added it seemed too easy. Angie didn't question him or ask about him just jumped right in. I disliked Wade because if he got his heart broke why was he jumping into a threesome. Ryan couldn't voice his jealousy about Wade with Angie. Angie blindly went along with everything and didn't show a mind of her own. The sex scenes were good and the only reason I gave it three stars. The end felt like the author  gave up on her characters. It ended just as quick as it all began. There was no plot only sex which doesn't normally bother me but this was so unreal. It felt fake from beginning to end."
3,"H Beam Piper will stand as one of the greats of sci-fi/fantasy for as long as the printed word exists. whether you are a mystery/thriller. detective novel or space opera/alternative universe fan. Piper delivers. In H B's writing you will find the forerunner of many who followed in his ginormous footsteps. (federated terran space. space vikings. even his place names have been copied by later writers! Aldebaran sound familiar)? Great reading. great fun and a must for anyone who really wants to be lost in another space/time continuum!"
8,"We bought this to use in our backyard as it said it was a smaller version to throw the balls a shorter distance.  They weren't kidding.  We have a full-size chuckit and this junior version and this really doesn't throw nearly as far.  I'd say the average adult could throw just as far as this. so we've kind of rotated this out of usage and just use the full-size if going to a park and simply throw the ball by hand if we're in the backyard.  This was a waste of money as you can just use the full-size for shorter distances too and simply not throw the ball as far."
12,"Excellent game all around except one thing....The game CHEATS.You can be in first place and magically all the computer controlled racers somehow manage to catch up to you anyway.Now. if you're in last place you literally have no chance of catching up.Not fair.Not cool.That aside....if you develop your skills you'll still win.After much practice I still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheats.Great graphics.Every character you love from the Mario universe.I think Toad is my favorite. when he gets hit LOL. The noise he (it?) makes is hilarious.The courses are inventive and enjoyable.The music fits in perfectly.Did I mention it cheats?That's my only complaint.Otherwise another five star winner from Nintendo.Highly recommended."
12,"This is one of the best and my personal favorites from the Zelda franchise! The story was fantastic. the gameplay was amazing for the time. even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitches.There was hardly any serious problems with this game. The playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do. Each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy. Some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating it?Puzzles in this game were I suppose challenging for  child but they were not impossible. This is a great game for all ages and a great buy as well."
5,"This is a great-sounding reverb pedal. Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep. rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). The design is very solid. and the controls are quite easy to use. Honestly. I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much. but there's no problem with them being there.I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon. U2. etc. Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones. this is it. This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals. but this one definitely suits all my needs."
12,"Greetings. I am Oklonia. My review of Super Mario 64 is right here.Super Mario 64 is a game that all master N64 gamers have to own!I don't even need to tell the story. What's happened? The same traditional story: Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool.Mario finds the princess. rescues her. and destroys Bowser.Capcise.The courses and star's names are quite creative. (e.g. Lil' Penguin Lost) They are more riddles though.The graphics are so sharp looking and realistic. that maybe just a few could go on GameCube. (GCN)Despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode. Super Mario 64 is really super!This has been Oklonia."
5,"These MoPads are pretty amazing. I recently just purchased the Atlantic 33935701 Gaming Desk so I had a feeling that I would need these pads.These pads are a must for an amateur recording studio setup with little or no acoustic treatment. Sitting your monitors or speakers on these pads will produce an even better quality sound experience and they also will get rid of unwanted bass vibrations from your desk. I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors. At $40. you can't go wrong with these pads for you studio. It is a MUST to have these."
10,"I purchased this machine about 3 months ago...I have used the drill press for making holes as well as sanding with various size drums on many types of wood. The machine has worked very well on all occasions and I am very pleaased with its operations.The only two draw backs are 1.) the need to use the chuck to get the bit either tightened or loosened from start to finish. can't use my hand to get most of the way there and do the final tightening with the chuck and 2.) the finish isn't very good. I know the finish does not affect the overall performance. but sends a negative message about the factory's pride in workmanship.All said. I would buy this machine again as I think its cost and performance match up well."
8,"My two mini-dachshunds love these treats. They're made of quality ingredients. with meat listed first. and are produced in the USA. I like that they contain supplements for joint health since dachshunds are prone to spine and joint problems. The pieces are too big for my little dogs. but they're soft and chewy so I can easily tear them apart. I've had the same bag for about a month now since my dogs don't get treats every day. and the treats are still nice and soft. not stale at all. These treats would probably be great for older dogs with dental problems. too. since they're so chewy."
1,"Lactaid Fast Act Lactase Enzyme Supplement. Chewable Tablet. Vanilla Twist 60 ea...but of medical necessity.  Lataid Fast Act and all that preceded it are and were essential to my physical well-being.  Lactaid always did its job as long as I did mine. which means. follow the directions and take the product with the first bite of anything dairy (in my case.)I would never hesitate to recommend Lactaid products to others.  I am certain that your results will be equally satisfactory. unless your need is due to another medical problem. in which case I can't say.  Now. go eat a great big ice cream cone. a bagel slathered with cream cheese. a large bowl of cereal (with your Lactaid milk. of course.)and a plate full of macaroni and cheese. and hum your way through each bite.  (For this feast of four items. three of which do not contain Lactaid from another source. you will want to take one pill for each.)"
11,"Let me give you a new family ritual before I even begin my review: Whenever someone in my family mentions Bananagrams. we all sing a little song to the tune of Menomena by the Muppets. It goes. 'Dut dada dat... Bananagrams! Dut dada dat.'Now for the review. The basic premise of Bananagrams is that lettered tiles are distributed among the players. and everyone competes to use all the letters in the bag to build real words that are connected to each other like a crossword. Whoever finishes first wins. I'm in my 30s. but when my siblings. parents. and I get together we play Bananagrams and have a blast. The game is simple but so much fun and fast paced. It's good for your brain. vocabulary. and concentration skills.If you like crossword puzzles or Scrabble. and if you have some friends or family who share your interests. you'll love Bananagrams."
8,"I have four dogs and so frontline is a must.  I always purchase from Amazon as the prices are almost half what my vet asks.  Free shipping. packaging is always good. Items are always as described and new in the pack. IMO. no other flea treatment on the market works as well as Frontline Plus.  Purchasing it in larger size is more cost effective.  I eye how much I put on my dogs and use it on my cats too.  Can treat 3-4 pets out of one dose."
5,"I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned. sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned. sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED"
7,"Using these in Japan. I have used them previously in Canada. They were sent to me by family since I wouldn't have purchased them again. In my case at least. Octenol seemed to reduce the kill rate...at least the number of zaps I hear throughout the day and night. It was the same back in Canada. at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind. If the mosquitos' hiding/breeding area is downwind of these then great...if not. then what? Given the massive and ongoing cost of these...I would just hang another zapper. I'd be willing to bet that would be MUCH more effective."
3,"I loved this title!  It's fun. sexy. very entertaining.The heroine is feisty. not falling all over the Hero. her own person.  She's not mooning over oh lover where art thou?  I like a no (or not too much) nonsense heroine that doesn't pout. cry over nothing. cringe. and otherwise wimp out.  She can give a punch and take a punch after all this is an adventure.  A tough cookie who doesn't mind enjoying one hot hunky guy without agonizing over it.The Hero is long suffering and on the heroine's side.  There are lots of bad guys and lots of double crossing.  It's just a good light read.  I did not think there was too much sex. it was appropriate to the story and relationship.  I happen to like space romances and this is a good one.I will read more of this writer."
3,"Father Mine is a short story that is a continuation of Zsadist and Bella's story. It picks up sometime after Lover Enshrined. but going on at the same time as well.This story starts after Nalla is born. about three months after. in fact. Zsadist is still having a hard time dealing with his past as a blood slave. and it's taking a toll on his mating. and with his relationship with his daughter.This is a sweet. romantic story that I was hoping for. having finished Lover Awakened and almost feeling cheated by the ending. This book gives Bella and Z their HEA. and it really makes me love Z more. Great short story. and a must-read for any BDB fans. :)"
2,"The idea of a machine that ground &amp; brewed coffee was too good to resist. and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog);  within the first year the heating element croaked.  Sent it back &amp; got a replacement unit. which incidentally only is warranteed for the balance of the first unit's warranty!  6 months later. today. with a full pot of coffee on board. it burst into flame!  Whoa! Fortunately my husband was in the kitchen and took care of it before the house went up. I'm going back to Braun. no question!!"
2,"I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.  She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition. but does well with her customary food.  I tried using a blender. but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.  We have used the Cuisinart I purchased when they were first introduced to the USA. which worked well but was inconvenient for on-the-spot use and for travel.  I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the 'cheaper' one.  I am impressed with its performance. ease of use and compact size.  It is clearly worth the small price I paid.  I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.  It is perfect for my intended use. and I can envision how to use it in cooking. I highly recommend it."
1,"My dentist scolded me for thrashing my gums by brushing too hard and for having too much plaque. He insisted I get the Braun Oral-B. which he said was the best of its kind. I'm glad I did. The design has a soft mode for people with sensitive gums and it has cut down my plaque. far better than had I used a conventional toothbrush. Also the device is easy to use and maintain so I'm confident I'll use it consistently. Finally. I must say my teeth feel far more clean and smooth now. The Braun no doubt will have prevented me from getting some serious dental work."
8,"There are three main problems with this product. The first is that it does not fit the littermaid box well at the base (where the box fits into the botoom). As a result you end up with some cat litter on the floor as a result. instead of all of it in this product. Secondly. the top part does not fit into the top well. Some effort required to get it in properly. Thirdly. the product is made of very weak plastic. As a result. if it is filled up. it bends quite a bit (to the point where it makes handling a chore). Higher quality/harder plastic should have been used to avoid this problem."
10,"I work construction and do plenty of research on tools. Skil currently makes less then par products. but with this exception. This saw is the industry standard. I see the MAG77 and the regular HD77 on every construction site. I like the HD77 because it is a little smoother then the MAG77 due to the heavier steel casing. which means no kickback and a stonger. more solid feel. Both saws are incredible and either purchase is an investment. Buy this saw if you plan on cutting a lot of lumber."
3,"These are very nicely written with lots of great vocabulary which I love especially since I have the click link for full definition!  The mysteries are not written from the point of view of the doctor. so you get to wait until the testimony to see if your accused will be found guilty! Some follow the &#34;Watson&#34; style character. some follow the innocent person caught in a horrible web of guilt. and some even follow the perpetrator! They are quite wonderful. Slight warning for you to be aware that in those times often the 'gentlemen' and 'ladies' (whites) are considered less &#34;suspicious&#34; than the &#34;foreign&#34; characters. But if you only read books with modern mores you will miss much."
8,"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out. although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean. but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle. fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle. remove the bag with its contents. tie the top in a knot to contain the odor. and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process."
1,"You want a battery that is going to last. then you can't go wrong with this one. I bought the 8 count because my garbage can needs 4 and the shelf life of these batteries is so good that I have no doubt it will provide me with the many months of use. Since I have the first 4 still being used. going on 7 months now. I am going to guess at least 1 year before I will need to replace so yes. a good purchase price for this 8 pack."
2,"My honey said this one was the best he's ever used. Every salad now has a zest of something wonderful in it.I got this one and the 'OXO Good Grips Grater'. and the 'OXO Good Grips 3Piece Peeler Set' for my honey. It's great to have an option of a bunch of different fantastic tools to make life fun. and dinner times zesty and exciting.Then it's time for ice-cream and who doesn't like ice cream with zestful spoonful's of grated bitter sweet chocolate.Before Dinners. my darling would also marinate delicious inventions he serves me for dinner. Every marinate has zest of something wonderful in it.Every muffin has a zest of something wonderful on it.Looks great hanging. looks great standing. looks great leaning. but looks best trimming. It's Zesty and I love it. now we can throw away that piece of sh_ that I'm sure moths and flies have landed on to give birth to zesty babies."
3,"Very. very funny. with the clever twist of having intelligent trolls that are a part of a functioning society.  My wife (whose Amazon account I am hacking since I do not have one of my own) starting downloading Tuttle's books on the Kindle and we are both in the process of flying through the entire catalogue.  This is one of the funnier books that I have read in a long time. set in a fantasy world that does not conform to the normal archetypes of the various creatures normally found in such worlds.  Get this story and enjoy it."
5,"I take workshop style guitar courses at a local Vo-Tech in a room that could not be any less suited to the purpose. People set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall. Bad scene (sounds like an old 'El Kabong' cartoon). and not what I want to have happen to my new Seagull Artist series guitar. This little Fender stand easily folds up into a package small enough to fit in the storage pocket of my deluxe TRIC case so I can take it with me to class.It's not the sturdiest. most secure or most stable design out there. but given it's extreme portability and the use I'll put it to. it's going to work great."
5,"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived. so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus. one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy. so for reminiscent's sake. I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter. this will work just as well as the expensive ones. and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]"
6,"I feel this is below average notebook paper here.  The holes were well punched in the paper I received and the lines were correctly printed on the pages with no missing lines. but the lines are light and the paper is thin.  It will work. but you could do better on price and quality at Wal-Mart.  If you can't make it so a store. this isn't a bad option. albeit not excellent.As a side note. I don't think it's too uncommon to buy notebook paper with lines missing on a few pages in a pack.  I've had this happen to me in the past."
11,"OK so I'm not into strategy games ( because I am horrible at those games) and I think their really boring.  And I was on the fence about this game but I was at a meet up and a group was playing it and their bragging how it's the best game....So I came home and researched it and had tons of great reviews.  So I decided to but it without ever playing it. Although I can't say it's the best game ever only because I am a into party games. but this is by far the best strategy game I have ever played. I am trying to get my fiance to play games ( not a gamer) and he loves it too. It is so easy to learn!!! The instructions are so overwhelming.  so what I do is go online and watch other people explain the rules and play.  because seriously instructions are hard to understand.  Definitely worth it and would absolutely recommend Ticket to Ride"
7,"It is a very simple yet effective test when someone needs to know the ph of soil (outside for the most part).The ONLY CON i have with this test is the pill capsules filled with the reactive powder which in the end is the catalyst for the color. You do need ph'd water or a very distilled water to test your soil with. If you use tap. you are taking the chance of an off reading due to the ph of your tap water. For the price and complexity it is well worth it. Not a perfect 5 stars but 4 is an understatement."
7,"This is a nicely made feeder. easy to assemble. fill with seed and hang.  I have had it up for about a week and so far no squirrells have  been able to get to the  food!  I have it hanging from a shepards hook  that  is cemented into the ground! The birds have had no issues that prevented or made it difficult for them to eat at the feeder.While it is nicely made. easy to assemble etc. it is in no way worth $72!!!  I can't imagine anyone paying that kind of money for a bird feeder that is suppose to keep squirrels out of it."
7,"I got this to go with my Craftsman air compressor that I recently got as the compressor only came with a basic inflator for the tires.  I wanted one that had a gauge on it so you could read the tire pressure when you are inflating the tires.  My compressor uses the &#34;M&#34; fittings. so I  bought the Campbell Hausfield kit to go with it to be able to get it to connect to my compressor quick connects.The inflator is fairly simple to use. just put the chuck on the tire stem and pull the lever on the chuck and inflate.  The gauge seems to be fairly accurate as I compared it to a regular tire gauge and the readings were the same.This inflator seems to be good quality and will work for what I need which is occasional use around the house.  It is a decent price at around 14 bucks."
7,"This is a good. standard pot holder.  The metal construction is sturdy and it keeps my plant perfectly perched on my wood railing (a plus because some of the non-adjustable holders I've found are meant for a skinnier metal railing and don't work for my situation).  So functionality wise. these have been perfect.  But aesthetically. it still pretty utilitarian looking.  There's really nothing in the way of ornamentation or decoration.  Because of that. I like using this with a pot that is well designed and pretty on it's own.Aesthetics aside. it functions as expected and is perfect for people (like me) whose railings are not a uniform size."
7,"The Havahart Deer Off Ready-To-Use Repellant applied a lot of repellent quickly. It was easy to set the direction of the spray. The battery option was a great addition to spraying to keep the deer from eating and/or trampling our plants and it made the application process a lot easier. It appears to work well as there has been no damage of plants after the first application.On the other hand. there was no wand with our bottle of repellant which made it impossible to apply a fine mist/spray (packaging implied it should have been part of what we received). The bottom compartment was hard to open and the nozzle we had to use because of having no wand dripped while applying.Update: This spray is doing a fantastic job of keeping the squirrels out of the birdfeeders."
3,"I got this book for my Kindle free; after reading I'm really glad I didn't pay anything for it. The storyline had the potential for a good 'Twilight Zone' kind of story. but was just too lightweight to make it. The author seems to feel the need to put in really XX rated sex scenes - she seemed to love to be able to use the word c**k. I didn't find this adding anything to the story. and only finished it because it's a fairly short book."
6,"This mounting tape has worked out well on many different surfaces. It is pretty strong too. I have actually used it to hang smaller/lighter pictures in frames and none have come falling down..yet. There is a good amount of tape in the roll. so you can get a good number of things hung with it. I also used it to hang one of the full length door mirrors on my daughter's bedroom door. It has held so far so good..and that is even with her slamming the door at times. I am getting pretty brave at using it for larger. heavier items - I just make sure to use a good bit of the tape around all edges. so that it is secure."
3,"This story was not like the other books I've read from Kallysten in the past. I found it difficult to engage in the story at the beginning. However. once I stuck it out past the first 5 or 6 chapters. I was pleasantly surprised. I found that instead of the instant sex appeal and gripping tensions with characters that immediately immersed me in the past. it was a story that read like a slow burn. gradually building up layers of complexity. and personality in all the players involved. By the time I was half way through the book. Kate's issues were personal to me. and I was rooting for them to find a way to make it work. I actually cried towards the end of this book. and that's an incredibly rare thing for me as a reader. So although it took me longer to get into the characters and their story. it was well worth it to keep it up. and see it through to the end."
3,"I've had this book since October 2011. It's now mid-March 2012. and I've only just read it today.I have to say. for the first page and a half. I really did wonder what I was reading. but very quickly the quirky writing and the tongue-in-cheek hunour took over. and I was caught!Trolls. Vampires. a man who finds things and a neighbour who is some sort of voodoo witch crossed with a look-out... This was great fun. Delighted to give this five stars. and hope that if you ever have a few hours and need a good short with no pretence of the irony and curious humour that fantasy can sometimes throw at you. this is a great place to start!"
7,"This is a great hatchet that Paul would have liked to have had in his wood choppers tool box. There was a heavy storm in these parts fairly recently with very strong winds that knocked down many trees. Two of my neighbors trees fell into my yard and tore up my cedar fence. I also had my largest hardwood tree get blown over in my backyard where it fell without causing any damage. I sure wish Paul was available to help me out. Instead of Paul. this Fiskars hatchet came to the rescue in helping to clear up this big mess. Yes. I had to use a chainsaw as well when it came to cutting up the tree trunks. But the hatchet made short work of chopping up a lot of the branches. The hatchet has a nice heft and a comfortable grip. The blade stayed sharp far longer than I had anticipated. This is a must have tool to keep at hand. A great tool and a great price..."
2,"I have several OXO Good Grips gadgets in my kitchen and I find they are consistently well designed and do the job they are meant to do and do it well. This corer is right up there with the best of the OXO tools. The handle is large and sturdy and helps me get a good grip so I can get the core out with one motion. I have really bad arthritis in my hands so if this tool did not perform well. I'd be looking for a replacement.I find this size takes out just the right amount of core. I tend to buy organic when possible and those apples are generally a little smaller than conventionally grown ones. This corer takes out just enough so the seeds and little tough seed casing is removed without taking too much of the apple flesh.Very pleased with this product and happy to recommend."
12,"I usually turned off all lights and played game in deep night after a whole-day work. even on bloody Quake I or Doom II. it is ok. And I was for a long time a Quake II fan. esp. in single player mode. With numerous add-on levels distributed on the web. I thought the 3D-shooter game has  reached the limit in Quake II. But alas. what a game the Half-Life is!  I  DARE NOT played it in the deep night alone with all lights off. With a very  good storyline and excellent atmosphere. the game is horrible!  You never  know what the next step will be. The monsters are not stupidly standing  there waiting for your bullets. instead they are chasing and hunting you.  It is simply the best single player 3d shoot game so far."
3,"This story was more a rough draft than anything that should have been published. First thing. the two men. we know they're ex-Seals. but we have no idea what they REALLY do for a job in this book (security?). how they came there. and what POSSIBLE interest they have in Christina since she is skittish and phobic. Off the bat. theyre trying to get in Christina's pants for a life time relationship... are you kidding me? Serious? All of a sudden they're flying from an unknown location to Chicago in their personal jet with a king size bed? Kidnap her dog? Its frustrating... this book was scattered in thought. execution and information."
12,"For years.DOOM has been labeled as an evil video game.with extreme violence and satanic imagery.But I say hold on a sec here.I am a Christian myself.and I absolutley love this game.Why you may ask? ...because you get to destroy demons that are straight from Hell!!! I mean come on! What Christian wouldnt wanna love doing that in a video game??? Its not like you shoot people.like in the Grand Theft Auto games.Only people you shoot are fellow marines who are evil and sold out to Satan. So Christians....play with an open mind and understand the TRUE meaning of this game. It is good vs evil!!"
1,"Review for: Rubbermaid Dish BrushA review for the humble dish brush.  I'm not sure what it is about this one but I prefer doing dishes with it more than the many other kitchen dish brushes I've tried from various retail stores and supermarkets.  I'll gladly waste time looking for this one buried in the sink before using another one just sitting there looking at me longingly.Like a car that lets you still feel the road. the bristles are flexible and unbunched enough you can get hard pressure right into the problem spots.  Flip it around and you get nice scraping action.  Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles. however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.  So hats off to this simple. classic rubbermaid dish brush standing the test of time."
7,"These Fly Web Glue Boards work as well as the single included glue board that comes with theFly Web Fly Trap. To be clear. this is not a standalone product. they are designed to be used in the 'Fly Web Fly Trap'.The Glue Boards have a protective sheet that needs to be removed before they inserted in the dedicated slot of the main unit. This is easy to do and it works reasonably well.We did a comparison of the 'Fly Web Fly Trap' verses theTerro 2500 Fruit Fly TrapandFly Paper Strips. Fly Catcher Trap. Victor Fly Bait 4 Pack. with the old fashion but very ugly Flay Paper Strips winning hands down.Recommended. if you own theFly Web Fly TrapCFH"
3,"A town that does not appear in the maps. a missing totem that is needed to save it from outsiders and a love story between a sexy shapeshifter and a woman with special skills make it an entertaining read despite the characters being a bit flat for my taste.There are a couple of very sexy scenes including a hot threesome; I just wish the author  developed the relationship with Burke's brothers a bit more. because it ended when it was getting really good. but overall I think there is potential for the next books in this series."
3,"i started the bloodrunners series by reading book 4. unbeknownst to me.  i had no idea what the book was truly about but decided to read it anyway.  i fell in love with the story so much i had to research and find out what else might be with this book... then purchased and read the &#34;bundle&#34;...i absolutely love this &#34;bloodrunners&#34; series...and to keep it straight in my mind i reread #4 again and am now on #5!  this was all done in less than one week!  my breaks and lunches at work are spent reading!  i have already pre-ordered #6 and can't wait for it to come out!  this is a fabulous set of stories!i am so glad to have found this author and this series and look forward to seeing what is added to the series in the future!"
2,"I've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice. Both times were a total sucess!  The ice cream is delicious!  No more ice and salt mess! Preparation time is quick and easy! The machine is a little noisy. however. no big deal. It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result. Time in the freezer is usually needed after it's done.  That's the hardest part....the waiting!  Clean up time is quick as well! Looking forward to trying the other recipes in the booklet. I'm sure they'll be just as tasty.  I highly recommend this machine!!  I know that we'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now!"
3,"I admit I am biased. as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance. entertainment. style. and of course current events. The Kindle edition is easy to navigate. filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience.  On occasion. I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture. or something).  The online editions can be hard to read. and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have. but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork. the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers). easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition. in a great reading format.Well done!"
5,"This is the answer to your all your power supply needs. If you own more than 1 pedal (and we all do) You need this. It powers my Wah and all my stomp boxes with 1 plug. It comes with all the different power plug options and a daisy chain for 5 pedals. It has the adapters to power pedals without a place to plug in by attaching the battery snap to the battery place on the pedal then pluging into the daisychain. It also has the pin plugs to attach to the daisychain for pedals that require that kind of plug in. and it has a 10 foot lead wire so you can reach out to your pedals or pedalboard without having to drag a heavy extension cord across the stage to trip on while your playing. you'll save enough money to pay for it in no time. not having to buy batteries. Get it. you'll love it! I"
3,"This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up."
10,"This plunge base is great for hand-held use.  It plunges smoothly and locks positively without any change in depth when you release the locking lever.  Its worst fault is the lock that retains the motor to the base.  It's a kind of wedge that is tightened with an Allen key. Its position means you can only turn the screw a half turn at a time with a standard Allen key.  A long T-handle Allen key solves that problem. but not its other fault. difficulty removing the motor from the base.  That same Allen key must be loosened several turns and then the block that acts as a wedge has to be loosened by tapping on it.  It isn't that difficult but it just seems a less annoying method could have been designed to hold the motor in place."
12,"This is the one that started it all folks! this is about mysterious murders in Raccoon city involving cannibalism. a group of special police officers called 'S.T.A.R.S.' go outside the city to find the murderers but when their Helicopter with pilot leaves them behind. they seek shelter in a large mansion but unknown to them that the mansion is also a death trap with hordes of Zombies. giant tarantulas. monster dogs and mutant creatures waiting for them. will they make it out alive?A brilliant and highly original game using elements of Lucio Fulci. George Romero. Dario Argento. horror and science ficiton with clues. gore. cool monsters. puzzles and knowing how to survive which makes this a one-of-a-kind game for every game player. I've became a fan of this since 1996. it's the best game i've ever played with the entire series too."
10,"This outfeed table is well worth the price paid. Assembly took me about half a day. but I wasn't in any rush. It color-matches the light grey of the Unisaw nicely. I really like the 12' fixed portion of the table- it helps on follow-through for smaller work pieces which don't necessarily require use of the full outfeed table. I'd like to reiterate what one of the reviewers said earlier that. unfortunately. when the table is not in use and hanging down adjacent to the saw. the single support leg of the table completely blocks the saw's exhaust port. I would rather see a support leg on each corner of the table. which would allow access for a 4' hose to attach to the exhaust port AND would provide a bit more stability for the extended outfeed table. A hose can still be attached. but the lowered table will not be able to drop to a completely vertical position. I would still recommend this table."
6,"This mouse pad works great with my optical mouse. It isn't thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad. It's the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead-filled wrist cushion. It is a COMFORTABLE mouse pad covered with a soft  polyester fabric attached to a non-skid sponge rubber base. The texture provides good control for my mouse. For me. it's the perfect mouse pad. it's a nice color. and the price is right. too!"
10,"I have used these for a few years. They are sturdy and do not deflect all that much even with abusive projects like fencing.The big negatives are:1. Hard to adjust due to choice of screws on the base that hold them in place. For some reason. these screws are not knobs or thumb screws. Instead. they are big screws that require a tool  to turn. Why? This is the sort of thing that begs for a knob or at least a thumbscrew.2. This works in conjunction with a length stop attachment. Because thee is clumsiness in setting up this units' support extension. there are issues that are caused on the length stop. too. It all works OK. but it is slower. stickier and more frustrating than it could have been.In any case. if you need/want something like this for the DW. this is your choice and at least it won't break."
12,"This is one of my favorite games of all time.  In this game. there are 30 different levels that are mostly composed of the same 3D Crash levels that we're used to. Some levels. however. you get to use a biplane. motorcycle. or Jet Ski. Like the previous versions of Crash. you have to collect crystals and gems.  Now. you can also collect a relic for having the best time.  The music is fun. the controls are easy and it's just an overall great game for any age."
11,"Twilight has a lot going for it. but I personally think it is just too top heavy for play.  You have to be a true fan and dedicate an entire day to play this game.  The box states a few hours but it takes an entire hour to set up the game alone.  And the concept is flawed as well. though it has a very nice idea behind it.  My personal bone to pick would be the artwork.  I happen to think it is silly.  But that is me and not a fair thing to say. other than I am the customer."
10,"I hate it when my shirt collars. not otherwise secured in place by buttons. end up in weird places throughout the day. I purchased some steel collar stays to use with these magnets but they were only vaguely magnetic. I ended up using 2 of these magnets - one in the collar with the stay and the other inside my shirt. to lock my collar in place. They work flawlessly. They are the perfect size. and there are plenty of magnets in case you forget to remove them at the end of the day."
3,"I thought that the hero was very annoying at first. He wanted the heroine and then went back to give his ex another try because he felt he owed it to her. The heroine then met his controlling. jack butt of a cousin when she was vulnerable from the hero and married him. A year later. her husband left with the heroine's money and best friend and the hero was no longer engaged to his ex. The hero could have saved them both a year of heart ache if he would have just stayed with the one who gave him the 'spark' he kept mentioning. but nope. he had to go back to the woman who was good for him in a robotic way. It was his fault entirely that she lost her 'fire' because his cousin drowned it out and she would never had went to the cousin if the hero did not reject her the next morning!!!"
1,"A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two.  This went on for several months.  After reading about this product. I purchased a tube:  within 24 hours. the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over.  Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  To say that we are shocked is an understatement. particularly when we read the ingredients. which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  This is a miracle in a tube. and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  Highly recommend this."
5,"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end. my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock. blues. metal. country. or punk guitar player."
5,"I've been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip. the right string resonance for strumming. and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest I've found so far for my style of playing. I'm a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely. strum more softly. and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - they're very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal."
5,"I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars. banjos. and mandolins.They attach to the wall with 2 screws.  Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall.  It takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic.The piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument.  The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have.I have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again.Very sturdy. well made product."
5,"I like the durability of it. and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be. but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i haven't tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on."
11,"We had tons of fun with this game! I'm excited it helps my 3-year-old learn letters. My 7-year-old loves it too. The box is quite big. make sure you have lots of room for storing it. Not a take along type of game. It's really a lot like Twister. with some added learning thrown in. Trying to touch your ears to the letters is fun. and hilarious. The only thing I don't like. is that if we get too many feet cards right away and not a lot of letters. the game is over too soon. and no one has the winning secret card yet. Just shuffle the cards well so you don't have too many feet card. The mat is very sturdy and colorful. and the cards and peices are well made too. We love Dr. Seuss and ordered this for his birthday celebration week. I would recommend this game."
2,"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower!  I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily. but also they didn't work very well.  So far. OXO's version has been a big improvement:  the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids. and with a simple twist. the lid is off cleanly and neatly.  I have found that the unit can sometimes slip. especially with a very small lid. but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface. you should have mostly success. as I have."
12,"Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made. and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value. you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me. and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given. it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it. since it is one of those video games you have to beat."
2,"This is as described but for some reason. I was still expecting it to be a little larger. I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices. sandwiches. cucumbers. etc.  It's the perfect size for what I wanted.  You could also use it as a form for making pancakes. etc but they would be very small!  I wouldn't use it as a cookie cutter but my family makes double the size of the average cookie.  Maybe for mini cookies this would work..."
2,"I followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated in buying this. The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up. Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use. The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple. Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples. A little of the core is left in the apple. but for normal store sized apples it works great. Highly recommended!"
2,"I used to own a Mighty Light. which is a very similar vacuum from Eureka.Used that one for about 5-6 years until it finally broke.This thing is slightly stronger and a little louder.This vacuum does a great job getting dust and Cat hair from just about anything(carpet. velvet drapes). Best part is you do not have to run the thing over every inch of the surface (unlike other small canisters). it's powerful enough to suck dust in even when it's in the close proximity."
6,"A long time user of Avery labels. I was especially drawn to these because of the promise of smudge-free labels with sheets that pass easily.  I have a finicky. but expensive. printer that on occasion wrinkles sheets that pass through the manual. non-drawer feeder.  This happens most frequently with labels.  So I was happy to see that after using more than 2 dozen of these sheets that they do indeed pass smoothly as described. furthermore no smudging!!!  This is vitally important as with these big labels pressing them onto envelopes sometimes requires quite a bit of handling.  I'm very happy with these labels and will definitely be switching from the regular 2X4 labels to these with TrueBlock that work seamlessly and smudge-free.Highly recommended!"
10,"This is simple and straight forward. The roller works very well...I will tell you not to let the glue dry on the roller. while it may not stick to the roller it is not easy to get off once it does dry. When you are done take a couple of minutes and rinse off the roller in the sink.The rest of the attachments are a cool idea but the hassle of changing them out makes them less friendly to use than the standard nozzle on a regular carpenter's glue bottle.  I love the roller and use it all the time and that makes this item worth having but I wouldn't get excited about the other attachments if I were you."
6,"This is a pack of standard. wide ruled writing paper that is 3 hole punched.  There are 200 pages per package.  We've had no problems writing on this paper and putting it into a 3 ring binder.The pages themselves are well made. but might be a bit thinner than other standard papers.  We have not experienced any problems with the paper yet. and we are a family of 2 adults. a 4 year old learning to draw and write basic letters. and a 7 year old doing basic sentences."
6,"This is yet another great label product by Avery.  Of course it works with Avery's DesignPro template software.  I used these in a HP LaserJet printer and had no issues with smudging--all the print was clear.  The only thing I did not like was the pop-up edge for fast peeling.  It works great if you print a full sheet of labels each time. but occasionally I only need to print a few labels and when the sheet goes through the printer a few times it can start to separate easily.  Not a big deal. just something to be aware of if you only print a few labels at a time.  I would recommend these labels and I would buy them again!"
5,"I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short. so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground. or horizontally placed. but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand."
1,"We're not much pleased with this brush. It's way smaller than we wanted and. owing to the angle of the head. one has to get their hand in much closer in to the grubby dish or pot they're scrubbing. That makes it hard to apply much force. We bought another brush in the same order. the Libman Kitchen Brush which Amazon also sells and which is a mite cheaper. It's a far better brush. bigger and better designed. This one is ok but not good enough to recommend."
3,"Simon he may be the beta of the Pride but that boy is fierce when it comes to his woman. 'if I find yout that you had a hand in helping Livia hurt my mate I will kick your a** so hard you'll s*** out of your mouth after I have you cast out of the Pride. You understand me?' He's just a big kitty where Becky is concerned. 'Simon was purring. She ran her hands soothingly up and down his back. making him purr even louder. She bit her lip to keep from giggling.' The man has no shame when it comes to sharing a bathroom. 'he looks at her. confused. He pointed with the toothbrush. 'Toilet's right there. baby.' I'm excited for Adrian's book."
1,"Several years ago my dermatologist recommended Zeasorb and I have been using it ever since.  It has become more a necessity now due to my weight gain following radiation and chemo treatment for late-stage cancer.  The powder is helpful in keeping the moist areas of my skin as dry as possible and free from itch.  The 2.5 oz. size being sold now is probably as a result of TSA's size requirements.  I was used to buying the 11.5 oz. size in the past.  The 2.5 oz. size is more convenient for travel."

2,"You most definitely get what you pay for. these are very cheap and have already started to show signs of rusting after just a couple of months.  Also look carefully at the fork and knife. they are shaped quite differently than a regular set.  The fork also bends pretty easily which is not good when trying to eat a steak.  The spoons are also very disproportionate if you look at the little spoon it is way smaller than it appears in the picture.  I hate to say it but I was not impressed with Ikea in this case. I had to buy a whole new set to replace this one."
10,"If you have some time and skill to fine tune this plane. it has the potential to be a useful tool.  I was initially taken aback by how much refining the plane needed.  I dont mean just honing. It comes with an edge that needs work before it can be honed to the point I would call it sharp.  The other parts fit tightly. causing you to fight them just to make an adjustment. I expected better fit and finish.  I like a plane. or any other tool to work smoothly. like it was  passed down to you from your grandfather.It isn't something that a little time and patience can't fix.  And I suppose that you could make the argument that this fine tuning will make you more familar and thus more confident with this tool.All in all. it's worth the price.  Just plan on breaking it in."
8,"I'm glad this toy has no stuffing in it. but for a few dollars more. the Kong Cozie is stuffed firmly and has a squeaker in the middle that lasts and lasts. My puppy has two varieties of the unstuffed Kong animals. one being this frog. They were correct to give you a free extra sqeaker. The toy. without stuffing. is very thin and flimsy. and the squeakers don't last. So far. the toy has not ripped. though. so I think the quality is decent for 5 bucks! But my 8 and 9 dollar Kong Cozies last as well and there is no need for extra squeakers."
3,"I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact.  I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison. TN.  I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately.  The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money.  I look forward to receiving it every month. and it doesn't hurt that I save $2.00 per month off the news stand price.  I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre."
8,"I read the reviews on this and was hesitant to give it a try because of reviewers who said it was so hard to get the off once they got it on.  These lids are very hard to find so I decided to give it a try and. for me. it worked great.  It easily went on and came off of 5.5 and 3 oz cans of cat food and 12.5 oz cans of dog food.  However. as one reviewer pointed out. after they've been in the fridge they clan be a little harder to remove.  Running a little hot water over the lid while it's still on the can restores the flexibility and it will pop right off.  They're great.  I'm ordering more."
8,"i was having a lot of trouble with my hip this summer and my chiro suggested i try this in addition to taking it a little more easy in the gym.  i was happy to try it since i was popping ibuprofen like pez.  it wasn't immediate. but. the pain has pretty much subsided. i'm finally running again and the only pain i feel are in the muscles that are still tight around the side of my hip. i am making sure to gently stretch and foam roll to reduce tension and soreness."
8,"This year I decided to go cheap and purchase a less expensive brand of flea control... well I certainly paid for it with a nice infestation of fleas. even on my inside cat! I went back to this more expensive (but certainly more reliable) brand and the fleas have completely gone. I noticed with the cheaper brands they have a lot of liquid and it takes forever for the big greasy spot on the back of the cat's neck to try. How unsightly! But with this I couldn't even tell if I was putting any on them. it was so discreet. I will definitely be sticking with this from now on."
3,"The story is short and enjoyable. Because of the length. time moves quickly. a few days covered by a few sentances to briefly explain what happened. feelings. throughts. While short. the writer has done a wonderful job with emotions. with showing how the characters changed over the four years from first meeting to finding each other again. Touching concerns. fears. wants and hope. very nicely done.Think of it as a condensed story without a lot of the fluff that is put into stories to pad the pages. The good base is there. but alot little things that would add length are not. For me. this was great. really enjoyable. I can see where others might not like it though."
11,"Melissa & Doug know just how to make things special for kids and easy for parents. This version of Hangman is great in that there are no pieces to go missing and it's easy to pass back and forth between parent and child or child and child. All of the pieces are attached with a type of rubber band that allow you to flip the letter or body part over but they never come off. The erasable pen stays clipped to the side and has a built in eraser in the pen tip.You can do this with a beginning reader's sight words and spelling words. You can choose vocabulary words for test studying for an older student or just free play. And there is something pleasing about the sound the tiles make when they are flipped over and make their 'thwack' noise.Lot's of fun for a beginning reader to just about any elementary age child. Durable. fun to look at and versatile."
7,"I've used this for around a year now. absolutely love it.  I keep getting more gardening tools and haven't ran out of pockets yet.  The pockets are all different sizes. some very narrow for something like a pair of scissors or a marker. there is a big one that fits my PH tester perfectly.  I also have theCustom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Bucketswhich turns the bucket into a chair and seals the interior if you want a dry spider-free place for gardening gloves."
10,"This is a fine saw.  It has been an acurate work horse since i bought it six months ago.  The standard blade was ok but required upgrading for fine trim and furniture work.This this is BIG.  It's not especially heavy. just big. It takes up much more room that a standard miter saw. The sliding mechanism is the primary culprit. The old saw stand in my shop. is now a laundry cabinet in the basement.  I had to build an all new. BIGGER. cabinet.It takes up about as much space as a Radial Arm Saw.  It costs  more than than a RAS.I not unhappy with the performance at all.  It does require the new cabinet for cutting large stock.  The stability on heavy wide stock as demands the unit be anchored well too.Make sure you need a sliding miter.  You may be better off with a RAS and a standard miter saw."
5,"I had a Cannon brand clutch and I bought this one to replace it. What I like about this one is how the release lever works. On the Cannon the lever was vertical. This made actuating it a less natural motion. With this one you hit it with a down stroke of your stick and it releases. That motion is much more natural and this makes it easier to use. An argument could be made that this one coule be easier to actuate accidentally but I have had no issue with it.Aside from the actuation of the release it is also well made and works very well."
5,"First off. I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert. however. reading up on this. they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said. it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke. but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also. I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these."
5,"To be honest. I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet. but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great. only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock. or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp. but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal."
1,"This is astoundingly dishwasher tolerant. It has emerged unscathed from the top rack of my dishwasher after pots and pans wash. 6 or 7 times already.Initially. I bought this to clean my tall ello glass water bottle with a narrow opening.  Now I use it on all hand wash serving and glassware.  The bristles are effectively scrub-y. are high quality soft nylon that doesn't scratch glass and collapses to fit into narrow mouth jars and bottles.  The handle is hand injury friendly with typical soft OXO comfort with appropriate density for a secure grip. A+"
7,"This grill is wonderful!  It cooks really evenly and the lid can hang on the side of the grill while tending to the food.  The hinged grate is great for adding wood chips for flavor.  The ash catcher makes for easy cleaning of the ashes and is worth the few extra bucks.  Our grill arrived in perfect shape and was very easy to assemble.  We use it almost every night.  This grill is sturdy and heats evenly and has the Weber name behind it.  We expect to be using it for many years."
1,"The first month of trying to get pregnant I used a more expensive clear blue digital test which didn't work properly as I kept getting errors of all sorts. I then got a cheap drug store brand which apparently didn't work either. I immediately ordered this for my next cycle. it was simple and easy to use. After my first try with it. I'm now 8 weeks pregnant. So what can I say. it works.Update 21/10/2013I'm sure it works!My son is now three years old so my husband and I decided we were ready to try again. So of course I turned to first response again. I bought a pack of these and used it for two cycles. They are pretty good so I was able to stretch it over two cycles. and to my surprise I'm pregnant again using these tests after two months."
1,"I just bought this for 4 dollars and 99 cents at Target in Austin to use in my Soda Stream 1 Liter Bottles.SodaStream 1-Liter Carbonating Bottle. Gray. 2-PackI was concerned that it wasn't going to fit through the narrow opening in them. but that actually wasn't a problem at all.  It fit perfectly and worked great in them. so I tried it out in my Contigo coffee cup and in my large Thermos.  It did great in each application.  I am very happy with this brush.  It is well made. cleans thoroughly. and seems like it will last a very long time.  I have no complaints."
5,"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but. I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"
1,"Although I'm sure my local fire department will cringe if they read this. I buy these things for our backups for our fire alarms and they last over 4 years!  Wow!  Now if I buy a knockoff brand. or even Energizer. I can only get 18 months out of them before they start squealing to be replaced.  Plus. this 8 battery pack makes it awfully simple to have them around when it comes time to change them. and it's the right number for my house.  Love these Duracells!  Highly. highly recommend!"
1,"I use a variety of toothpastes (cough...whatever's cheap...cough) and this is what I'd call a 'throwback' toothpaste.  It's very simple stuff down to the flavor. no crystals. no magic strips. no flavors from an alternate universe. no voodoo magic. just toothpaste that feels like the stuff they used to hand out on international flights.  It's fairly light. tastes like some sort of generic mint. and cleans very well.  Apparently it's good at whitening.  But the best part is that it's dirt cheap.  It's a dollar for a big tube of toothpaste. basically.  Much better than the other cheap toothpastes (except one of the aquafresh varieties).Only drawback is that it's made in mexico (if that bothers you).  I've never had a problem with the quality control on this toothpaste."
5,"These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them. I use to get a real kick out of changing strings because the new strings sounded so much different and better. but now the thrill is gone because these strings sound good for a couple of months although I change once a month anyway. I don't notice much difference at all though.But the best part is that these strings are over $17 bucks a set at my local music store and I get 'em for about $9.48 through Amazon's subscription service delivered to my mailbox every month with free shipping! Beat that!"
12,"My friends and I got this when it first came out so long ago in like 99 or something like that.  Might have been earlier too.  Anyways. I played it through myself on Leon first and the game had an amazing storyline and the RPG part of the game is amazing.  There are a few challenging mini puzzles which can be very annoying. much like Zelda. but once you get past them all is well again.  I would highly recommened this game to anyone. and compared to the gore they have in nowadays games. this is nothing."
11,"If you have never played a trading card game or dungeons and dragon card game. this might SEEM to be little intimidating but its actually really simple to understand.Infact its lot simpler than real trading card games like magic the gathering which has so many different spells and abilities it can be confusing what each one really does.First thing you want to do if your new to this type of games is to check out all the pieces. all the cards. the cavern/dungeon tiles. This will help you get an idea.Then read the instruction booklet over and over till you understand it and you will. it may take a few days but you will.The cards dont have the great art that magic the gathering has but in exchange for that you get these amazingly detailed and awesome figures which is so satisfying to see it there on the board attacking you.  You don't get to see that with traditional trading card games where there is no figures."
2,"When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray. I was delighted. The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator. The cube compartments are easy to fill with the hole in the lid and as you walk to the freezer the cover prevents spilling.The MOST CRITICAL aspect is taste and smell. Since there is a lid. the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do. I have four of these ice cube trays because we live in Hawaii where it is always hot and we constantly need ice for our drinks.Since I first discovered these ice cube trays I have never used the kind with no lid. These are by far better and less messy."
6,"Overall. I believe this copy holder to be a good product.Pros*Good looking (although it will most likely be hidden behind copy or a book*Holds books flat (due to elastic band. and bottom lip)*wide enough for to hold two 8 1/2 x 11's*very sturdy (due to the heavy base)Cons*Seems the clear plastic could break (also due to the heavy base)*adjusting the angle is not as easy/accurate as it should beAlso of note: this won't work well as a cookbook holder because there is no splash guard for the books"
11,"What I didn't realize when I got into the X-Wing Miniatures game is that it wasn't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game. or board game. As such. to play in tournaments. you need the extra expansions. and the additional X-Wing is a must for Rebel players. Giving you an extra ship. extra pilots. extra droids. have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles.This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set. but for larger battles. this is needed for the Rebels."
11,"Great Game.  If you like bluffing. like poker. or confrontation games like Risk or Axis and Allies. this game is at the top of the class.  The main rule is that your alien character somehow circumvents and or otherwise breaks a rule or rules in the game.  The rules and the way the game plays allows for interesting player interaction.If you are looking for a game to get for someone that likes the bluffing and ante aspect of Poker then you will like this game.  Give it a try it's a classic and it's worth every penny."
3,"Between political struggles and his being a vegetarian. I was looking for a bit more on the spiritual side. After all. he was called Mahatma. Which means great soul. (This review has to be short.)Gandhi was confronted by Christians who wanted to sell him their twisted idea of Christianity. Actually he was greatly moved by Tolstoy's work; Tolstoy hated how Christians distort the teachings of Jesus. and are so anxious to wage war. Jesus taught 'love thy neighbor' and &#34;turn the other cheek&#34;.He struggled with diet. he refused to eat meat. eggs. and refused even milk. In the end he tried to subsist on fruit juices. Gandhi believed that abstinence was important in realizing God. yet he was disgusted by his own lust and how he treated his wife."
12,"I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.Well. my problem(s)?Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me )It's cheap now so. I guess it wouldn't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..so do what you want with it."
3,"Mother and daughter and daughter's younger friend. Apart from being well --- if a little old fashioned ---written this book is one remarkable journey that every woman MUST read and every man must experience. It's a grand romp in the best tradition and nary a deviation into the horrors of modern day handcuffs and whippings and similar. It stays sexy and it stays erotically on track. It takes place at the farm where the servants are sent out of vision and earshot and the main players ....play! Sex in the best tradition. Read it and if you don't get a serious twitch every time you do...I feel sorry for you."
8,"I have used Frontline on my dog for years. but this is the first time that I purchase Frontline Plus.  I cannot be certain that our problem is a direct result of the Frontline Plus. but my dog developed a growth and open wound at the place where this is applied.  I have contacted the company and they were very kind and made a report for their research.  However. the dog required medical attention and antibiotics.  Just wanted people to be aware to keep an eye on the application site just in case it was a direct result of this product."
7,"I purchased this trimmer in May 2008 and I am very happy with it.  I have used it about 5 times.  The majority of my weed trimming is done by a yard service. but I needed a trimmer for touch up and weed trimmer in areas outside the lawn.  It is very nice to put in a battery and go.  Battery life is good.  I can get about 20 minutes of hard use (briars. thick weeds) and about 40 minutes of light use (grass) out of a fresh battery.  The unit comes with two batteries.  I have changed the 'string' once and it was easy.  The trimmer is light and quiet. May experience with the cordless trimmer resulted in me purchasing the B&D cordless pole hedge trimmer.  They use the same battery. which is very helpful.  All and all very good product. if you understand your getting a light duty trimmer."
11,"First off. this game is a blast! I've played it a few times and every time is unique. challanging. fun. and most of all. it creates memorable moments. Word of warning. though. if you're new to more complex board games. this one's a doozy. but don't let that scare you away from the game. When learning how to play. it helps to have the board set up and sort of mock play a few turns. reading ALL the directions and playing through the scenarios the rules cover. The first game you actually play might move a bit slow at first. but once all the players learn how the turns work. the game moves along at a good clip."
6,"I am married to a woman who sells lots of things on Ebay.  She is also very conscious of recycling everything she can.  I work for a company that visual appeal when shipping something is almost everything. so when I reuse something. it better look new.  Sometimes. my wife asks me to package something up for her using an old packing envelope. that's fine but I either have to remove the old label or place the new one over the old one allowing you to see the old info.  To compromise. we decided to try these labels and much to my surprise. I can't see the old label under this one.  Yes they are a little more expensive. but it does make our marriage a little better."
12,"This game is simply amazing. you can't disagree. it is so fun. never repetative because everyday I would invite friends over to my house and we would play for hours and hours. The gameplay is great. if your into Melee it is similar but it takes a while getting use to the controls of the Gamecube. I was a master at this game. I loves it so much. a character I recommend that all beginners should use would be Fox. he is the easiest to use. but he is also very good if you can use him right. Jigglypuff and Ness are not for beginners. but Metronome might be the strongest move in the game. This is a fantastic game. unlock characters. set new records for your vs matches because every match you have goes down into the record column. This is a must have for N64 whether you are 10 or 20! Remember though. play with friends. not by yourself!"
6,"I like this phone so much that I bought a second one in white. It works well. does not require power to operate. and still has a few options of more expensive phones. By using a key combination. you can participate in 3-way calling. It has a mute button. volume control. Flash. auto redial. and can store up to 12 numbers in memory. It has an illuminated keypad and a 3-level ringer adjustment button. It is lighter than Trimline phones from the '80s. but it doesn't feel cheap. It's just that all of the analog parts inside from that decade have been replaced by digital ones. Even if this phone craps out after a year. it is so affordable that I consider it a &#34;disposable&#34; item. I recommend buying this item."
7,"This trap can actually catch mice. but if they aren't small. will only injure them.  It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat. who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap. then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as 'starting fluid' in automotive stores). Ether is a potent anesthetic which was used on humans in early medical procedures. It's also extremely flammable so take great care."
1,"when i was in high school. i perspired excessively. it was so embarrassing. i always had huge wet spots under my arms. i saw a commercial for certain-dri and i decided to give it a try since normal anti-perspirants didn't seem to help at all. after using certain-dri for a few months. my problem was gone. then i tapered off my use and only used it once a month or so. i haven't used it in a few years now and i don't sweat under my armpits any more unless i am working out. i recommended this product to my sister. who was in her late 30's. and she had the same results. i'm not sure how it works. but it definitely does the job!"
5,"Hey. it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several 'cheapo' pedals. and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic). at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound. not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough. it doesn't take up much space. it sounds great. and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND. if you are like the typical musician. you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank."
7,"This feeder I do really like. It helps me fight my squirrel problem &#34; but I do have some smart squirrels&#34;  a few have figured out ways to work around it but it is difficult and they don't stay very long. So it does work  and I like it.For any one who also has a raccoon problem you may want to try this one .  I know you told me up front in your detail about this feeder it was squirrel proof not raccoon proof .  But we were having a raccoon problem and this one he can't get off the pole and put on the ground or get the top off.  But you must be sure to close the top securely and tight.  I have two of these feeders now and the raccoon has stopped for now."
7,". . .whether they're being attracted for a mile radius.  I didn't think I had a big fly problem.  We had a few flies.  We're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii. not a horse farm or overly near a public park.  Still. the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies.FWIW. this trap works.  It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown.  During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree. no flies came into the house.  I'll take a break for a week. then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased.FWIW. take two. I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught.  Ick."
1,"There is a newer offering from braun which I also have. The 7526 razor has been around for several years now and is by far the best one ever made. I have had mine for well over 7 years now and it still works like a champ! I have had to replace the foil and blade twice and the replacements are for sale on amazon. I accidently plugged the cord into only one slot on a power strip and it ruined the power cord so I thought I would 'upgrade' to the newest version. The newer razor did not shave as good as my trusty old one. So I purchased a power cord and I have since packed the new one away in the attic. I'll never give up this razor! It holds a great charge and I am still using the original battery."
7,"This trap is great.  I've read the reviews and once you get the hang of setting this trap. you realize it is simply awesome.  As mentioned by others:  DO NOT FOLLOW THE BOX INSTRUCTIONS.What you need to do:1- bend the trigger down a little2- use spade shovel in the turf to make slots (2) for the jaws.3- use good sized wood chips to obstruct an active run near the surface--enough so that the trigger rests on the wood when placed.4- check trap daily...you'll be surprised how many moles use the same run.Once I figured this trap out. I've killed 6 in the very first 2 weeks!!!***WARNING:  check the laws in your city/state.  These traps may be prohibited.  One of my neighbors called the animal warden on me and he confiscated 3 of my Victor traps claiming that they are 'leghold. steel-jawed traps'.  I will be going to court soon..."
12,"I just loved RE 2 when it came out and even more scary then the first game. you play as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield.  there is one area in the Police station that when I went down a Hall..Scared the hell out of me and made me actually jump from my chair.  that's the type scare I enjoy.it was that good because you didn't expect it. every time I play this game and come to that place in the game  never fails to make me jump.. this game has two hidden characters.  Plus based on who you play Leon or Claire. you met two new characters in the game.I recommend this game to any fan of the Resident Evil series."
3,"Amy works way too hard as a lawyer and basically has no personal life.  The good side to her working so hard is always getting to see Justin. a man she's wanted for years.  Amy and Justin end up having to go to Hawaii to finalize a case they've been working on.  Little does Amy know that Justin has wanted her since the day he saw her.  While in Hawaii he intends to make his feelings known and give her one of her secret fantasies.The book wasn't very long. but it was very sweet.  There was a good relationship between Amy and Justin and very little drama.  Both characters were nice. had great chemistry. and seemed believable.  There wasn't a ton of information in the book either. but since the characters had known each other for years the way things happened in the book didn't seem unrealistic.  If you want a sweet. sexy story this is a good one that won't leave you feeling depressed."
5,"Now-a-days I just search amazon because they have always got what I want at reasonable prices. This is no exception. I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one. You will not be disappointed.Also. I ordered it on a tuesday and it came the next day. No special shipping. Maybe it is my locations but that was great too. Well packed."
5,"I was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars. but thought I would just be careful with it.  But I have no concerns after using it on two string changes.  In fact. I cannot see how one could nick the guitar while winding. since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head.  The string cutter works great. one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly.  The pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works. and though it is a tighter fit than I expected. it does work and means I don't need to find a pliers.  Overall. I am very pleased and saved time on string changes."
10,"Overall. this is an 'ok' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this.  The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the 'up and over' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work.  That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects. and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."
2,"This is not a kitchen essential. but I love it.  I only bought it to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promotion. and as it turns out. I use it almost everyday.  I have had it for over a year. and it still looks like new.  I rarely use the dishwasher. so I wash mine by hand.  I probably wouldn't bother putting something like this in the dishwasher anyway.I like to bake. and I use the spreader to spread butter over the dough for cinnamon rolls. spread pizza sauce over pizza dough. and I have used it a couple of times to put the frosting on cupcakes.  What a great tool for 5 bucks!"
3,"Up until the point where the author wrote that the Pope Pius XII and the Catholic Church did nothing to help the Jews. the story was engrossing. However. the author didn't do his research well or he would have learned the truth. The black legend that said that the Pope did nothing to help the Jews may be the 20th century's most enduring lie. Historical documents prove that he did whatever he could to save them. His dilemma was how does he speak out without further endangering the Jews. He went to the edge of risk and he saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish people. Many he kept hidden in the Vatican and others were hidden in convents and monasteries. Hundreds of priests went to the death camps for speaking out against Hitler.I. a Jewish woman. gave this book one star because of this major flaw."
7,"I hadn't put out a feeder for several years. but a little green hummer kept bopping over the the patio this past week whenever I was outside.  He'd hover and dart around the chimes and lights. making it obvious that he was looking for a feeder.So ... I ordered two of these because I wanted some that were small. affordable and had a bee guard.Thanks to Amazon. they arrived very fast and my little hummingbird has already found it.He's happy and I'm no longer feeling guilty.These are easy to fill and just the size I wanted."
1,"Not much to say here. but I like when products I'm looking at have reviews.These are durable. good. effective... Basically. they are exactly what you want when you are looking for replacement tips for your gum stimulator. Also. they are inexpensive. I will definitely buy these again when I need more!Note: They may seem stiff at first. but you are supposed to run them under hot water to soften them before use. It took me a while to figure that out. I think it's on the package. but I don't remember.Anyways. good product. 5 stars!"
6,"What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP.  It performs exactly as you'd expect.  The price from amazon is good.  The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club  or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit.  The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer. and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff."
3,"This is a sweet book about Zhadist and what he does to put his past behind him so that he can have the future he truly wants with his mate and child.And what a mate he has.  She is perfect for him.  Understanding and loving and willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her child and assure the future she deserves.  She is strong and determined and yet loving and accepting for Zhadist as he is as well as the horrible past that has molded him into the person he is now.And what love Zhadist has for Bella.  He is willing to do whatever must be done to exorcise his demons so he can give her and his child the life they deserve.  A truly touching story of love.This story is a must read for any BDB fans."
5,"I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick. but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This. of course. can be very annoying. especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto. great for leads. and because of the way they are shaped don't hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost."
8,"My 15 year-old 80# mixed-breed dog had slowed down noticeably. I followed the directions on the package but didn't see much difference after 2 weeks. At the end of the third week of feeding these treats once a day Herbie started running again. At the end of the month. he is romping and playing with my other dog like he is a puppy. I just watched him take the stairs 2 steps at a time. It seems like these treats took longer to work but once they kicked in my arthritic old dog now thinks he is a strapping young man."
10,"I have never had a sander like this before. but when I was refinishing a desk for a lady . I decided to get one. I compared several other units and decided on this one. I love the variable speed and with a course grit belt. it made light work of the 3 coats of paint I had to remove. it is very maneuverable  and the dust catcher works great also.  I used a light grit belt and some light hand sanding  for the polyurethane finish and the lady's words were: &#34;you turned my old desk into a thing of beauty&#34;  ."
6,"I'm not real sure what I'm supposed to say about this stuff in a review. I mean. is there anybody in the United States who isn't familiar with Scotch tape? It's the grand daddy of all cellophane tapes. and this gift wrap tape just adds a couple features that make Scotch tape better and better. First. it's a handy three pack. just in time for Christmas and assuring even the biggest of gift givers enough tape to wrap everything. Then. there's the satin finish. which becomes darn near invisible on patterned paper. and pretty close to that on everything else. Finally. it sticks. This is a great product. and I don't see how I couldn't give it five stars."
12,"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is really awesome. but how awesome? Is it the best of the Legend of Zelda series so far? Oh. undeniably. but that is not the point. My point is that it was the best game for the Nintendo 64. with Super Mario 64 and its direct sequel. Majora's Mask in a second place draw. It shows how the franchise began. Link sets off on a journey to save Hyrule from the evil Ganondorf for the first time. He meets Princess Zelda on the way. and when she flees from Ganondorf. she leaves the Legendary Ocarina of Time in Link's possession. He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword. The graphics were neat for the time. the storyline was really exciting. and there is a lot of stuff to collect. The dungeons were challenging. and the boss fights are neat. If you are a fan of Nintendo. please pick this up. You will be glad you did."
5,"I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents.  Besides the risk to my guitar. there is the cost.  For the price I paid for this guitar. I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents.  I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it. and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits.  It has much better tone than I expected. and very good action.  Stays in tune very well.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party."
12,"They really hit the mark on this one!... characters. storyline. play. music. graphics... everything just superb for its time!  I played this game over and over again just to play it.  It's a fun game. but out of all the times I played it I could never defeat the Ruby Weapon.  I think he's like impossible or something! LOL  But even so. that wasn't much of a let down because the rest of the game was so cool.  And Sephiroth... what a perfect villan.  He looked pretty cool!  If you've never played any of the FF series (and even if you have). this is a definite 'must have'!"
6,"I have always liked Scotch brand products and this one is no different. I like that you get three rolls of this tape because if you are like me one is never enough when wrapping gifts. I love that the dispenser is easy to use. The tape comes off the roll very easily which is a huge plus in my opinion. I also love that the gift wrap tape is clear when you place in onto the wrapping paper. It makes the gifts a lot more appealing considering that you don't have to look at tape 'lines'. In my opinion the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is the best tape for wrapping gifts this holiday season.If you want a tape that is easy to use and looks great on your gifts look no further than Scotch Gift Wrap Tape. I do not think that you will be disappointed."
8,"I have two Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies (5mo & 10mo) and they LOVE the Galileo Bone in the 'Souper' size. They grab it with their two front paws and will knaw on it for a half hour straight. It seems like it will last for a long time and the more they chew it. the more they enjoy it. It doesn't make a mess when they're chewing. the ends fray into something like tooth brush scrubbers. but don't break off.  I don't think the 5mo old would enjoy it as much if the 10mo old hadn't already started chewing it to create these scrubbers. It's probably best for dogs that have their adult teeth grown in. It would be too tough for the little one to knaw into a brand new one. I'm ordering a second one so they don't have to share it anymore! :)"
2,"Before buying this product. I used an apple corer and divider. I hated using it because I'm petite and it would take me 5 minutes of using all of my strength to core the apple and have it cut into wedges. I am starting to eat healthier and decided to buy this apple corer to see if I liked it better. I love the OXO Good Grips Corer! It takes just seconds to core the apple and the core is easy to remove from the corer. The handle is comfy and easy to grip. Cleaning the corer is also easy. I use this to core small and medium-sized apples and the core comes out completely. However. I do not think the core will come completely out with larger-sized apples because of the size of the head. Overall. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,"This was a great follow up to King of Prey. The main character in this is the right hand man of the King of Hawks. Sachin meets his mate when she is to young to claim but he continues to visit her as she grows up. After mistakes are made and trust is lost Sachin must figure out what he wants and how to hang on to it.I liked how this book went with a different approach to how the main characters meet and their relationship progresses. There was no instant love with them flying off into the sunset. It was a more real love with a undeniable passion between the two that is common in the paranormal romances. I enjoyed following both characters and learning about them. their pasts and their futures.Again I love this series and so far out of all the books this one was my favorite. I definitely recommend this to fans of Paranormal Romance or shifter stories.*I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review.*"
7,"No way does this product perform as promised.  And what a waste of time it was trying to make it work!I don't think this company considered all the possible railing configurations before making its claims.We have a wooden railing on our deck.  At the top of the rail. one 2x4 is on end and it is topped by a 2x4 laying flat.  Any which way we tried it. it did not hold. would not grip the railing and kept falling forward. The screws are on the bottom of the L-shaped arms that are supposed to hug the railing.  How in the world are you supposed to tighten them when they are facing the railing?  Only if you assemble it OFF the railing; then you can't get it ON the railing.(I think I got all the parts:  I received the basket. two L-shaped arms. six flat-head screws and six plastic cap nuts.)"
6,"I needed this for my daughter. for school work. The paper is pretty good &#8211; it&#8217;s not the really thick paper I remember from my own youth. which was so course that I could actually see the pulp fibers in it with the naked eye! Its thinness reminds me more of the paper I used in college (in the Stone Age. before everyone had a computer).I don&#8217;t think that the paper is unusually thin. It seems to me to be good. normal. wide ruled paper. We are already using it for some work and we are happy enough with it.(Review of Mead Filler Paper. Wide Ruled)"
1,"I bought these in a pack of 6 using Amazon Prime and considered it a great deal.  I need saline spray after having a septoplasty 4 weeks ago and this saline rinse fits the bill.The shape of the bottle and the nozzle are better engineered than Ocean (in my opinion).  This bottle provides a nice. gentle spray.  Great stuff and very good at moisturizing the mucosa.  Does what it was meant to do.I used this heavily after a septoplasty surgery and also imagine it would be good for those using a CPAP machine dealing with dry noses.  I prefer this over Ocean and some of the other saline sprays because the bottle format is actually nice and delivers a very consistent mist of saline.  The 'fatter' ocean bottles always feel like they get squeezed in the middle and become more difficult to use as the bottle gets emptier.I like this brand the best -- great stuff!"
6,"This paper trimmer looks cheap (the body is gray plastic). but is sturdy and reliable and more than meets all our small office needs. Love the grid that helps you keep the paper straight. If you need more than a few sheets at a time cut. or other features like a spring-loaded arm. you should invest in a more expensive heavy-duty trimmer. But this is more than adequate for us and a welcome addition to our office equipment. as I can't cut a straight line with scissors to save my life!"
12,"This game is one of the only games to truly terrify me. (the other being silent hill. check my review on that in upcoming weeks!)  The graphics are just right for this type of game. although they could have been better.  The control is muddy. although never cumbersome.  the weapons are alright. but upgrading them is a hoot.  I wish that you could upgrade more weapons. though.  An upgraded rocket launcher that could blow through doors. now that would be really...' cool!!!  Oh well. If I want to do that. I should go play Red Faction.  The zombies are as dumb as oxes. but the lickers and dogs and the birds (THEY ARE COMING TO GET ME!!!!) are fairly intelligent.  avoid those at all costs. if you know what is good fer ya.  adios!"
5,"I read several reviews of pop filters on Amazon and was surprised by how dissatisfied many were.  Finally I just went with this one and I'm pretty happy with it.  It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just don't bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then. I'm gonna keep it and use it 'till it rots or gets lost."
5,"After all the whining I saw about these picks. was a little hesitant but bought them anyway. It doesn't help that Amazon puts 'Most popular' posters above 'Most recent' so unfortunately the review many of you read no long applies to the product. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. So I got my full order. In addition. I like these picks a lot more than the plastic ones I buy at the local music shop. They feel thicker or more stable or something without being hard. I am very happy and will be reordering when the time comes. These are by far my favorite picks. The feedback is good and they're stiff enough to strike clear tones. A winner to me."
8,"I left a review regarding Petmate Purrforma jumbo. it was a smelly.horrible mess. Well. I got lucky. My PetSmart told me to bring the Purrforma back and they would credit all toward a new Littermaid and supplys for it. There was even enough credit left for 2 30# bags of the Nutro dog food I use. The Puurforma is so overpriced as well as poorly designed. I had the receipt for the Puurforma from the month before. I now have my 3rd multicat Littermaid and am very happy again. While not perfect. as litter cleaning will never be perfect. these do work well for me. I have one in the laundry room. one downstairs and the other at my farm. I have yet to find a cat that will not use this box. My cats at home are all over 10 years old. At the farm they are 2 years and younger. Hope this helps."
7,"The Ready-to-use Deer Off II worked very well at repelling squirrels for about 2 weeks. not the claimed three months. and then its effect diminished.I tested the ready-to-use Deer Off II in my back yard because I've had to pick up Squirrel droppings to prevent my dog from eating them.  I did not find squirrel droppings in my back yard for about two weeks after application to my shrubs and the perimeter of the small yard.  Two weeks later I'm finding an increased number of squirrel droppings.Its battery operated sprayer worked very well.  I like the safety lock just below the sprayer's trigger. I intend to use the sprayer for my weed killer even though the power could be improved."
11,"My Twilight-obsessed teenage daughter and her friends played this game several times.They enjoyed the trivia questions. but preferred to dispense with the game board. They were more interested in the clips and outdoing each other with their vast Twilight knowledge than the details of the board game itself. They especially enjoyed the fact that all three movies released to date were included in this edition.That being said. it is a great sleepover game for teenage girls who are in to Twilight (aren't they all)? If you're looking for a great tween gift or planning a party or sleepover. this is a good choice."
12,"If you see this game around Immediatly purchase it on the spot. this game can provide hours and hours of multiplayer fun. (1 player is boring but better than playing multiplayer by lonesome) there a alot of unlockable characters that are pretty cool here tehy are: Captain Falcon from F-zero series. Ness from the rare Earthbound series. Jigglypuff from pokemon. Luigi from the Mario Bros. series. And if you have a gameshark there are cool codes the allow you to be the boss of the Smash Bros. titles. (Master Hand) and you could also be Metal Mario with a Gameshark. cool huh? have fun and train. This isn't one of those titles you can just rent and enjoy you gotta own it for it to be fun."
5,"I haven't measured signal throughput so I can't comment on that.  But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle.  This thing simply will not crimp. will not kink up on itself. does not get twisted and has no tension in it.  It's the easiest handling cable I've ever dealt with. a real pleasure when you've got all kinds of wires running all over.  It's like a floppy noodle but light and sturdy. and the jacks are strong and stable with no loose connections.I have a 10-footer with one right-angle connection. and the right angle is a perfect fit for the jack on the bottom end of a Telecaster."
6,"As address labels these do everything you'd expect them to do - you can print names and addresses on your printer. peel them off easily. and stick securey to envelopes. If your wordprocessor doesn't have a template for them. one can be downloaded from [...].However I also used these labels for another purpose - organziing several closets. No longer do I have to remember which sheld the fitted king sized sheets are on and which is the fitted queen sheets - just print out what you need on these labels. stick them to the front of the shelves. and you're done. (Just use a nice large readable font). I reorganized the linen closet. hall closet. and basement closet using them and I couldn't be happier."
7,"This little light is easy to assemble. needing not much more than a screw driver to tighten the nut and screw. Once it is clamped down on another sturdy object. it stays put.  It doesn't wobble or come undone.  The cord is five feet long.  Depending on how far away this lamp is from the plant. the effective radius is plenty enough (about 24' from a foot away).  I use this over a germination set next to my bird cage. and my little dove gets some of that light as well.One thing about this that may be dangerous to other users:  the black hood that goes around the socket gets VERY HOT!  This lamp would not be recommended around birds or small children.  However. set in a nice location this is a pretty lamp that provides good swivvel and warmth.This clamp comes with a 60-watt bulb. packed in its separate cardboard support."
6,"We do a lot for our sons PTA. so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not.  We had a small 6' cutter. that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth. and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from.  The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting.  So basically. if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force.  The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving.  However. this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review."
12,"I have both this game AND Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance. And I love them both as much as the other. Tetris worlds my not have a Battery Back-up. but it more than makes up for that with the extremely fun game variations and the classic tetris Music.Tetris DX DOES Have a battery. but it's just basic tetris. I'm able to score at least 400.000 points regularly. so every time I top out I have to put up with that annoying rocket launch sequence. wheras with Tetris Worlds. when you top out. you can start the next game right away without having to put up with annoying rocket sequences. the bottom line: went I want to play Classic Tetris. I play Tetris DX. when I want Enhanced graphics and effects and Nostalgic Music. I play Tetris Worlds"
8,"I have tried both products and for me this one seems to work the best. It keeps fleas away and ticks. I also use this with the Vibrac Preventic Tick collars. Before I started using this and the Preventic Collar. I was always finding ticks on my dogs. 5 and 6 at a time and they would be totally engorged by then. Now. I may find one or 2 baby ones on them. but get them before they can really bite the dogs. because something in this product repels them. so I really am a believer in this. I totally have seen the difference and can't live without it. I stock up on it because it runs out of stock often."
6,"Although my ordering of this product was totally accidental I decided to keep it since it is such a wonderful product.  I just will not run out of tape for quite a while.  I would highly recommend this product and remember the most expensive label makers are not necessarily the best.2-16-2012I did not open this product right away but when I did I found the incorrect item had been sent not just by one company but two; neither of which are Amazon.com.  I have actually stopped doing business with one company because they would not allow me to return the item."
8,"I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews.  First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart...very cumbersome.  However having said this the green light was on.  I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate. 7 am every 24 hours.  I had to wait until the next day. well it never rotated.  Also the lid is very easy to move.  I have a Bengal cat. even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it.  I needed the feeder as we are going away.  However I returned it.  I will look for other options.  Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews.  Save your time and effort. this product is not worth the trouble"
2,"For my husbands and I's first Christmas I asked for a potato masher. He got this exact one and I can say that I've used it once a week for 10 years and its still perfect. The handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything. I love all the Oxo products. they really do last years and years. I've bought other companies products for the kitchen and they fall apart. is I specifically look for Oxo Good Grips whenever I go get a kitchen gadget because I know it will last for years. One tip. after you mash the potatoes rinse off the potato from the masher because once that potato dries it takes alot of work to remove."
7,"I've owned two of these feeders and my only complaint with the first one is that the yellow &#34;flowers&#34; come out too easily and get lost.  This resulted in wasps. bees. etc being able to drink the liquid.  I had used it a few years and am supposing they aren't meant to last that long.I bought another one just like it and have had no issues so far.  Otherwise. great feeder with large capacity.  It is very heavy. so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb."
11,"The first time I played the game with 2 other players. who both thought they were smarter than me and laughed at me when I asked questions on how they interpreted the rules.  One of my opponents had played the game prior to our &#34;match&#34; on more than one occasion.  It turned out. I had interpreted the rules correctly and missed many opportunities to play the way I should have been &#34;allowed&#34; to play. but I still beat the other two players.  I would play every day if I could.  Great game for mental stimulation. motor skills. strategy. etc."
6,"So. I won't.  I can. however. get excited about the value you'll get on Amazon.If you need bubble wrap for shipping at a good price. this is a good deal.Note: Most bubble wrapping will stick to your shipped product if you're sending it across state/country in 100+ degree weather. the product material is susceptible to it (glossy book cover. plastics. etc.)and the barrier between the wrapping and the outside of the shipping container is minimal in thickness.  Be aware of this and cover your product with something prior to applying the bubble wrap to ensure your product won't stick to it (i.e. a single layer of wrapping tissue around the product)"
12,"This game is fun for the exact opposite reason that Metal Gear Solid is fun.  In this game stealth isn't of much importance. while quickly killing all the bad guys on the screen is important.  Like most action games this one is staged out into many different missions. which usually have five or six objectives in order throughout the level. My personal favorite aspect of this game is the target system which locks on to the enemy of your choice making the game easier in a crowded room of enemies.  Syphon Filter is one great pure action game."
2,"I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean.  This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean.  As soon as it arrived I went to my local hardware store and replaced all of the screws with stainless steel because that seem to be a problem with other users.  I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure. I had a pot of beans.  The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you can't fill it too much.  I just love my new pressure cooker.  Looking forward to many great meals."
2,"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.  Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.  This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.  I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.  Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!  I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively.  Have no fear......!"
2,"I've been vacuuming for over 40 years and I enjoy trying new products.I have a myriad of machines. from $100.00 to $1400.00.  No matter what I try. Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.  The ergonomics are perfect. but the singularly winning aspect of this machine is it's strong suction and firm grabbing power as you pull it back toward yourself. It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble. re-arrange. clean or empty trays. reassemble. etc.  I just tap the 'On' button. release the handle and go.  I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go."
1,"I had purchased a urinal for my husband on Amazon. and he asked me what he could clean it with.  So I got him this OXO good grips bottle brush.  While the bristles could come down a little farther on the handle. even if you were to use it for a baby's bottle. the bristles are very wide. (and flexible while still being sturdy). making it an asset to cleaning any kind of bottle at all. Again. a wonderful OXO product! (Get the impression I am a fan?).  He says he loves it. so five stars it is!"
8,"I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is a chew-maniac. I bought this bear hoping it would last a bit longer than most. based on good things I have heard about the Kong brand. It's been about a month and a half now. and he has ripped out the pouch for the replaceable squeaker (the squeaker itself was the 1st thing to go- in the first week). but the squeaker in the bear's head is still there. Aside from that. the rest of the bear is fully intact. My pup treats it with care. not biting as hard as usual when playing tug of war. He also plays fetch with it. but surprisingly does not chew it. I have seen him licking it and carrying it around though. When I get home from work. he often greets me at the door with a toy already in his mouth. and this bear is definitely one of his favorites."
11,"I thought my one year old would be super into this. he loves sticking things into slots. However he is barely interested in it. Partly because someone has to hold down the flimsy foam bottom while putting them in. And you have to push them in really hard into the foam to get them to stay. which he still can hardly do at almost 2. Then you still have to push fairly hard to put them on top of each other. though they still stand up somewhat if you don't click them in all the way. We are disappointed as there were many of these types of things to choose from and I am sure some of the others are better. And they are definitely overpriced."
5,"This is a very good TS type pedal at a great price.  The ability to adjust treb and bass is nice.  The enclosure is metal. the knobs feel sturdy. and the switch has a durable feel.  This is an analog pedal an the only Digitech pedal I've ever contemplated keeping.  I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal.  If you don't have a TS type pedal this is a good. cheap choice. Personally. I didn't think it sounded any better (or worse) than my other TS type pedals (Behringer TO800.Joyo Vintage Overdrive.Deltalab TO-1.TS808 and TS7).  As I indicated. I have the tubescreamer sound well covered lol.  I opted instead for the Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive and I am very happy.  If you don't have a TS type overdrive and are thinking about dropping a bunch of cash on a TS808. you may want to check this out first."
12,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;  &quot;Why am I playing this?&quot;  &quot;Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!&quot;Buy then and only then."
7,"I am  Master Gardener and I must admit I broke the Cardinal rule of gardening. I never test my ground.  Even when the MG program offered it to me for free when I graduated. I could not be bothered.  I thought I could adjust my garden when I needed it myself without any help from a test kit.  Until I moved. this house has a wonderful piece of property that I use for my vegetable garden and for the first three years everything was perfect. until this year.  Nothing wants to grow. so I broke down and bought this item. low an behold I have a problem. nothing major but my phosphorous is completely depleted and that is the explanation for the way my veggies are growing.  I found out what must be done and I did it and everything is turning around..Good sound product I recommend it to the gardener that thinks he/she knows it all. (but we really don't.)"
11,"We bought this as a part of homeschooling our 4th grader.It required some of my help for holding things in place while my daughter built the circuit. but she could complete 90% of the work herself.  The &#34;inventions&#34; worked well (minor shortcomings in the blinking light circuit. but it wasn't a big deal to us).The telegraph was a bit trickier since the placement of the &#34;clicker&#34; had to be just right for it to work.  But. it was a good challenge for us because my 4th grader really appreciated the lesson that some (or most) things don't work on the first (or the second or third) try.  We kept fiddling with it until it worked.  When it worked. it was really satisfying.We learned a lot about simple circuits from this kit!"
12,"This one started it all so it is the most popular. It has great graphics for the 64 and the sound is amazing. I loved all of the super smash bros series and to this day these r my favorites for each system. It has a great multiplayer game and the stages r very creative. The only bad thing about the game is that there r only 12 charecters and not that many stages but remember this is the first one. If u look at the front it looks like a kiddie game but thats what all of the nintindo games looked like back then. The graphics r so good that sometimes u cant tell this on and the melle games apart."
11,"There is a reason that &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; has sold over 2 million copies and has won numerous awards in several countries. I had not even heard of this board game until recently but after receiving it from Amazon last week our whole family became addicted and we have played it almost every day.  It's simple enough so that young children can learn it but has enough strategy that there are entire web sites dedicated to playing it more thoughtfully.  It really is a great game.The only negative aspect is the high cost.  I bought it from Amazon and that was still expensive.  Ebay and others want between $40-$50 for it.  It's just a board. cards. and plastic pieces - no justification for the price.  If you can get past that - there are no other downsides.  I'm glad we bought it."
11,"My son is almost two and has had these on his magnet board in his playroom for a few months now. He likes the farmer and the tractor magnets the best and we use the animals to work with animal sounds often. These are small (which I know. it's in the description). The artwork is pretty cute and the magnet part does it's job. They come in really cute packaging...my friend used them in her little one's Easter basket. which was great visual display. But really for $18 they are more of an item I'd expect to find in an overpriced Boutique. Once they get out of the cute carton packaging they are just your ordinary $1 bin magnets."
2,"My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.  I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.  It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.  This book teaches colors as each of the butterflies finds a place to stay for the night.Update - My daughter is now well grown but this book sticks in my mind still - we read it so many times.  I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young."
10,"I just got the jig saw and right away was impressed with how well it cut. I've always had the cheap jig saws...since for a jig saw you only need a machine that moves the blade up and down right?....WRONG! You need a blade guide that stabalizes the cutting edge. you need a powerfull machine behind it to provide a consistant speed stroke. you need a balanced machine to avoid fatique and not have the machine vibrate.  Also. the Bosch blades cut like butter thru the wood.  I was able to make repetative 1/8th cuts in pine without the blade wandering and I was holding the wood on the bench only with my hand..hardly any vibration."
12,"Ape Escape is an awesome game with amazing graphics and great storyline. The game has over 200 different monkeys. each with hilarious attitudes. This was (no doubt) my favorite game of all time. cuz I just love playing adventure/platform games. This game is not easy to beat if you want to complete it 100%. There are time trials for almost every level and cool mini-games. It took me over a month to beat the game 100%. but I'm just an average gamer. I recommend this game. cuz it's fun. exciting. cool. and CHEAP $$$!"
2,"I purchased Several OXO Good Grips including a Lemon/Lime Reamer. Cheese Plane. Wire Potato Masher and Box Grader.  They were all reasonably priced and are made of good quality material.  The potato masher is the best that I have ever used and I use it for everything.  I like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon.  Add a can of black olives in the mix and mash them up also.  I would recommend this brand.  The handle has a nice grip and is nice and soft.  I considered this brand because I have the wire whisks and other products by OXO."
5,"For the price. this is one of the best pop filters. It easily clamps onto my stand and doesn't move around after I place it. However. there is one problem I've had with it. It can easily lose grip of the arm holding the filter. What I mean is that. if I pick up the mic. the arm will swivel away. Granted this was caused by me dropping it once. but before it was fine. So for a good price you get a filter that works."
11,"I bought this game based on numerous glowing reviews of it. however i was somewhat dissapointed in it.Pros:-Deep. engaging game with tons of replayability.-Lots of character choices-Tons of expansions to keep even veteran players happy-Once you know how to play. the game is very easy to understandCons-Incredibly complicated. This game has hundreds (thousands with expansions) of pieces. and setup and tear down is very long.-The board is absolutely massive. It did not fit on my regular dinner table with all the pieces. and the expansions make it even larger.-learning how to play is not easy. and its not something you can just pull out and teach someone."
8,"This stuffed frog is for &#34;small&#34; dogs. and I mean small. It is very small. and my dog is 12 lbs. and she loves it. She loves tiny toys. I estimate this toy is best for mini-pets like Chihuahua or small (under 10 lbs). I didn't actually see this one from Amazon because I ordered it for my best friend's new puppy who live in CA. I saw this at Petsmart and loved it. It is very cute. and from memory. it is about 3+ inches tall. The fur is soft. and I believe it also has a squeak in it."
1,"For the price. this product isn't that bad. but don't expect too much from it.  The 'massage' basically amounts to it vibrating a lot. which can feel somewhat nice. but not as much as I had expected.  As a runner. I've tried many different foot massagers and this one is on the slightly below average end.  The unit also doesn't put off much heat at all.  You can get more heat from sticking your feet near a light bulb.However. being able to control the product with my toes was fairly nice. and I do use it occasionally.  I just don't think it should have been labeled as a'Pro Ultra.'  There's nothing really 'ultra' about it."
7,"Living near the woods. we have all kinds of critters:  chipmunks. squirrels. rabbits. racoons. and deer.  In addition there is my nutty dog. so I don't want to use anything toxic around her.  Deer Off has non toxic ingredients. and so far seems to repel the critters. though it's still early in the season and I haven't yet planted my flowers due to the cold weather.  I especially like that Deer Off doesn't require mixing. an improvement over products I've used in past years.  So far so good. but I'll update on effectiveness when my garden is planted."
6,"Need new business cards fast? Don't want to pay for rush printing and shipping? Then these cards could just be what you need.I had no problems setting up the cards to print. Of course. as always. there are a couple of things you should keep in mind:1.) Do not tear the cards apart when you are done. 'Snap' them apart by bending them toward you.2.) Place one sheet in your printer at a time.Yes. these tips are printed right there in the instructions. But looking through the 1 and 2 Star reviews on Amazon. I think a few people missed those helpful tidbits before they wasted paper and ink.Of course. I didn't need the whole 80 for my emergency card run. Now my son gets some nifty new Math Facts flash cards!"
8,"I initially bought this item to help with the minor pain I get daily from inflammation.  However. I find it works ok for the inflammation. not as good as I had hoped. but by surprise it certainly helps with my night sweats and hot flashes.  They have decreased immensely and I don't feel so uncomfortable when I'm shopping and break out into a great sweat.  Not sure which item in this does the trick. but I'm one happy camper.  I sleep better too!  Give it a try. it's not a bad price either."
2,"I have had this spreader for several years now.  I really like it. but you have to take REALLY good care of it. or buy a new one every year or so.  You must dry it immediately after washing. so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes. but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done).  Also. the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.  This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader. I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that). wash it by hand and dry it off.  Then I let it set a few hours more. and put the item back together again.  If this sounds like too much hassle for you. then you might look elsewhere."
6,"If you are resusing old file folder these are the absolute best.  There is NO bleed through of whatever is written behind it. even if written in dark black sharpie.The labels have some sort of coating on the back that really does block everything out.You can quickly find a template in Word by typing in 8366 in the search box after you do 'File' 'New'.When using these templates I always select the whole document and have the edges of the cells of the tables filled in so that I can tell where the edge of the label is while typing ( In Word 2007 this is under the Home tab in the Paragraph section. it looks like a little 4 square box with the bottom underlined).  Chose 'All borders'.  You can then go back and Chose 'No borders' when done if you do not want the borders printed."
6,"Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets). printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site. downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future. now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive).  Final alignment was perfectly centered on each individual label; no fuss.These are REALLY easy to print and use; the pop-up easy peel feature is great. too:  no more struggling to peel printed labels off the sheet.  These peel quickly from the sheet. simply by gently folding the backing slightly.  Great solution for quickly printing 80 return labels per sheet; highly recommended for EASE OF USE."
1,"I've used an Oral B since 1993. and am on my 3rd one. The first one finally 'burned' out a few years ago. and the 2nd one I somehow left in a motel room. and it conveniently got 'lost' (hope the maid is enjoying it). as when I called that afternoon. 'nothing had been found'...These cannot be beat. Like many other reviewers have said. the dentist's ALWAYS notice the difference when people switch to these.Personally. I always brush on high speed until it beeps. then I switch to low speed. and re-brush. and then go onto my gums and tongue before stopping.A Great Tool. from a Reliable Mfg.. Not to be Beaten! If you've not used one of these. by all means. GO OUT AND GET YOURSELF ONE. NOW!! You'll NEVER regret it! ~operabruin"
11,"okay so i am in love with the wizard of oz! and when i started to inot the world of Fluxx. i knew i had to buy myself a copy of the game. i had played star fluxx and wanted that but when OZ popped up. i couldn't say no! the box of cards come in perfect shape. but after a few days the box started to rip on the sides. ive had to type them. but the cards remain in great shape. it's a fun game of never ending change. and is a great party game. once you understand the basic's your golden."
6,"This oil comes in a plastic container with a nozzle that makes it easy to lubricate the shredder. Yes. it is outrageously priced but it does the job it supposed to do. I just don't believe a product should be given a poor rating because of the price. I do believe that price is a factor in the purchase decision but not in the product itself. But. that's just my opinion. When I run out of the Fellowes lubricant I will refill the container with vegetable oil because of the price but not because of the quality of the Fellowes oil."
10,"Please see my review on DeWalt DW 9043 bulb. as most of that applies here.  Bulb worked great. but runs very hot.  Lens very hot. after 2-3 seconds touch. reflector about the same.  Metal hinge/holder too hot to touch.  Some plastic smell in first 10 minute inspection.  Checked again at 1 hour 5 minutes (total test time) and still the same. No scorched or melted plastic.  A winner...UPDATE April27/12:  Still working great with normal drops and bangs.lens heat not an issue...  UPDATE  dec 31. 2012:  Wow. this bulb is tough thru drops and bangs from daily use; I wish I could find a girlfriend that was as bright and hot (and lasted as long) as this bulb."
3,"This book confused me from the beginning all the way to the end. It starts without any pre story. You dont know anything about any of the characters. all you get is this woman who is scared of men. these two 'hot' guys that work with the girl a best friend who sets something!!! up. it doesnt really say until it gets hot and steamy. So its 0 to 10 in all of 3 seconds. This book lacked details that developed the characters and not knowing details made it seem very unbelivable."
11,"This just seems like one of those instant classic toys. We starting using the Elf on the Shelf last year after our kids were asking about why we did not get an elf and so-and-so does. Within days it felt like we had been using the elf toy for years. Our children enjoy the hunt each morning. especially if Elf has been mischievous during the night. This always brings out big laughs. It does not take much effort to find a place for Elf to be each morning. No worries if Elf decides to stay put two days in a row...it must be a comfortable spot. Notably. Elf's legs have creases to bend. but the arms do not. That said. you can fold the arms. they just do not have creases built in."
6,"There is a lot of debate on whether you should just buy cheap canola oil for your shredder or more expensive shredder oil.  I'm sure both work fine. but is the $5-6 price tag on this really worth taking the chance?  For a moderate home user. 12oz of Shredder Oil will last probably longer than your shredder (maybe two shredders).  I for one think that this is a small price to pay to protect my $250+ Fellowes Micro Cut Shredder.  As far as the product goes. it works great.  I have had my shredder for a couple of years with moderate use and there has been no build-up of oil or slow downs in its function.  It is still working as well and as quiet as it did on the first day.  I use the oil every bag change or if I haven't used it in a few weeks.  Great product at a reasonable price."
6,"One of my summer projects was to file. re-file. and re-organize existing files. Not the most pleasant task in the world. One of the things I wanted to avoid this time around was my messy hand written tab titles for the hanging folders.Voila!These Avery computer generated tab title thing-a-me-bobs are exactly what was needed! Download the template. type the titles. print out and attach- couldn't be easier.I love it when simple products perform their designated task well and make my life just a little bit easier."
11,"Received this as a gift for my 6 and 8 year old on the road.....perfect!  With grandparents it kind of starts a 'conversation' where they can come up with a word. or my kids can. and gets things going around while waiting for food at a restaurant.  Trying to entertain them and stay in their seats when they have nothing to do is simply not realistic. so things like this really make a huge difference (tic tac toe as well). And at $12 you will not be annoyed at the price.  Totally worth every penny. Yes. I'm annoyed the pen is already dried out. but yes. any Sharpie will do. Wish it came with at least 2 replacement pens. would have paid at least $1 each for them since they have the cool eraser at the top (no need for a tissue). A great product!"
12,"I understand that this is an original. but there are some things I didn't quite like with this game. In the Unknown Dungeon. I climbed a set of stairs and then ended up in a wall! I couldn't move anywhere except for out of it and back to the previous level. Eventually I managed to get up without being forced into the wall. Also. most of the game is Blue if played on the Game Boy Color or Advance systems. Gameplay. music. and the story are all extraordinarily great for a Game Boy title."
8,"I love Frontline Plus for my cats. but it gets expensive. And then when I moved to a new neighborhood I found a few stray cats too. Before finding them new homes. I had to use flea control meds and it definitely got expensive.  I'm so glad this was created.  I just hope that something like this can be created for the oral medication for Program too.  I have some feral cats I can't touch and mixing Program in with their food is the only thing I can do. and that gets pricey too.  I'm very blessed I make good money. but still..."
7,"As an avid griller and lover of cooking on charcoal. I can't say enough good things about the Weber Chimney starter.This simple to use chimney style starter quickly lights enough lump or briquette charcoal to fill your 22 1/2 inch weber grill WITHOUT LIGHTER FLUID!!Lighting is easy. Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney. place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal. use this puppy to light your coals. and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier. I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.  On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again.  A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill."
5,"This is a good stand that can be used for both electric and acoustic guitars. The upper brace has an interesting way of securing the guitar neck making it unlikely your instrument will topple over. The stand can be used with or without the upper brace. On mine. the wheel that locks the upper brace in place is not as locking as I'd like it to be. Also. the &#34;feet&#34; don't spread as wide apart as I'd hoped. A few more inches would have been appreciated. All in all. a good but not &#34;perfect&#34; stand."
10,"I've had mine for years and it works great. I use primarily at the Miter Saw since that's the only tool in my shop that is stationary. For any small shop it works great. This used to be my DC for my basement shop before I moved into the garage. The only problem I had with it was on my belt/disc sander. It didn't pick up the dust that well but the there was roughly 25 feet of hose and PVC to go thru. Not the DC's fault. Overall. I'd recommend it for any small shop"
12,"Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good. Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so. It protects the controller fairly well. Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods. The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides. Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it. Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways. Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart. Will update my review if it doesnt last long."
6,"I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is!  It has a large footprint and it's got a significant weight to it...it really will hold up to 300 sheets!  I do find that for some reason. the little elastic cord that runs across it to hold your paper against the back seems to pop off when not in use. so if you move it around frequently to make room for other things (as I mentioned. it's rather large). you run the risk of losing that cord."
5,"CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again"
1,"Every morning I take a 16oz insulated thermos bottle into work with tea. coffee. yerba mate. juice. or something similar. My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle. This bottle brush is able to quickly. and easily clean the inside of any bottle. And for just $5. every bottle should get a decent cleaning once in awhile!Vinyl bristles are nice. don't deteriorate. hold soap well. and have just the right amount of flexibility to be stuffed into a bottle-top but just enough rigidity to get cemented-grime off bottle-walls.Hope that helps!"
12,"...  In more ways then one. it trys to match the style and fun of Goldeneye. but fails miserably.  Considering this game was made after Goldeneye. you would think it would at least have quality graphics. but no.  Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating. where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character.  The missions are vrey booring too.  This game is very hard even on the 'possible' setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game."
7,"This is the cheapest made product I've ever owned.  To insert the 2 batteries. there is no flap that you open.  You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver. then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor.  Insert the batteries. put circuit board and switches back in. insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut (3 each). hoping the screw doesn't fall out while you're holding the nut.  Are you kidding?  I'm returning this. because I don't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries.  I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries. you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle."
10,"I have had the saw for over half a year now. Indeed the tool assembles well. the overall instructions are clear. and the cutting is excellent. However there are some flaws that are rather anoying. The fence moves when clamped making any fine adjustment tedious. the on/off switch bracket keeps on coming loose. The plastic plugs at the end of the extrusions etc. pop out all the time and the blade guard with the splitter is impossible to align. In frustration I had to just remove that system because long pieces if wood kept on wedging the blade. Final conclusion: good saw with some anoying defects. I think that there are better deals on the market offering a superior overall quality."
2,"First off if you are looking for a quiet fan. go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for. As the name says this beast is a WIND machine. it generates a moderate air flow with low volume on 1. a moderately high air flow( close to that of the medium sized Vorandos) and a decent amount of noise on 2. and this thing moves mountains and sounds like a hurricane on 3. I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep."
10,"Yup. it goes in my trunk. or in my truck. It is that important. And. the Milwaukee Offset head fits in the carry case with the extra battery and charger. So. if you are like me. and you must have the proper tool for the job. And the job must be done right. Well then. here is another Milwaukee that is a must have! When you get it. buzz your name right into the outside of the case with your Dremel. And you will be set for many. many satifying years to come. Good Luck. and God Bless."
3,"Ok. I know it's free and shouldn't complain... but sometimes I just can't help myself. Does that make me a bad person? No. just an honest one.  At first It was ok....not bad. but then I signed up for some REAL blogs and discovered that yes...BAD. and getting worse! It's a waste of my time to read about a cooking utensil for something I will never cook or a designer's clothes I will never be able to afford.  There are occasionally some info on books. but I can certainly find that on my own.  Seriously. kitchen utensils. what the celebrities wore at a concert and Korean cooking(which is quite frequently blogged about) are not things that I will miss after canceling my &#34;subscription&#34;.  But hey. That's just me!DawnBee &#60;3(you get what you pay for)"
1,"I bought this lotion after a friend recommended it.  After my first use. the ammonia smell was too much to bear....it cut clear through my clogged nasal passages (I have a really bad cold).  Perhaps I should have known this ammonia scent would happen since ammonium lactate is the 2nd listed ingredient...but for some reason. I did not review the ingredients list so it didn't even occur to me.  This lotion is so very expensive that I expected something different.  Due to the very prominent ammonia smell. I couldn't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.  Surely there is a more pleasant way to exfoliate and moisturize."
8,"In 1994 One of my heavy-chewing Samoyed dogs had a deadly episode with a Nylabone toy.  When I made the President of the Nylabone company aware of the problem with his product. he was extremely cooperative.  He not only undertook settling all the medical expenses but a couple of months later sent my dog a Galileo Souper with an attached note that read:  'Our team of engineers have come up with Galileo. the toughest dogbone around. created just for hard chewers like Rajah.  This is the first bone off the production belt for him.  I hope he is well now and will enjoy Galileo.''Silver Frost Rajah' has since passed away of old age. but his offsprings and currently his grand-puppies are enjoying it.  And. except for some teeth-scrapes. the Galileo is STILL intact !"
3,"I wasn't familiar with Piper until I happened across this 99 cent kindle compilation of five short stories (although I had read the first story 'Genesis' at some point in the distant past).  These are great examples of true classic sci fi stories. originally published in '50s pulp magazines.By and large. the stories hold up well but there are a few 'future' technology details that seem dated.  And like much pulp sci fi from the fifties you can see the unfortunate influence of McCarthyism; but. as with much older fiction if you can get past that and accept it as a reality of the time it was written. the story is very enjoyable.This inexpensive kindle editon is very well formated.  This little book serves as a great introduction to Piper or just as a quick read when you are in the mood for classic pulp stories."
3,"These two have a relationship gone bad and he doesn't know why. She pushed him away because of her fears but he is determined to not let that come between them.  He fights her to get back together with him.This book is a short one but it is spicy.  There is a bar scene (youll read about it if you get the preview copy first) that is cool and my main reason for getting this in the first place.Like I said it was a short book and I know sometimes I feel cheated when I get one so if your not into mini books don't do this one. but if that doesn't faze you its a good afternoon read.The sex is good to if that helps you decide."
8,"I got this for my 10 week old miniature dachshund puppy. She loved it. and unlike a lot of toys. she was able to make it squeak very easily. The body of the toy (minus tail) is about the size of a small mouse (real). so you wouldn't want to get this for a big dog. It came with an extra squeaky. which I loved. Unfortunately. our larger. chewing machine dog got a hold of it and tore it. so the old squeaky is broken and the new one won't stay in.  I might have to order another one. it was such a good toy for the puppy!"
6,"That makes this my first Costco purchase.  I have a one person household so a mountain of toilet paper isn't that attractive.  I'll say though. it was a bit of a shock to see Costco using Amazon.  They seem to have an active site of their own.As to the paper. it is a nice bright white that I don't have to be embarrassed using.  It is the right weight to go through my laser.  So. 3 to 5 stars are certainly in order.  I went with the middle but could have gone higher. if &#34;Loving&#34; paper had a bit better connotation."
1,"I have white tile in all the bathrooms. and the grout gets stained. Nothing for it but to scrub the grout occasionally. Not my favorite job. but this brush is comfy and the handle is at the right angle.Here is the recipe I use to make grout cleaner. I think it works better than commercial sprays and it's cost-effective:1/2 cup of baking soda1/3 cup of ammonia1/4 cup of white vinegar7 cups of waterPour this into a spray bottle (not one use previously for bleach; I would suggest buying a clean. new bottle at the hardware store.) Spray on. scrub. Do not ever mix with bleach; ammonia and bleach release chlorine gas from the bleach and it is instantly toxic to the lungs and can overpower you quickly."
11,"This game is so fun. Being a guy that used play D&D; back in the day but doesn't have the time to play a game that lasts 3+ hours. this is the perfect alternative. You can play with up to five friends or play alone controlling two characters since the monsters are controlled by cards that determine the attacks.It always is unpredictable due to the innovative random tile sets. You can also easily design your own adventures as well.Tons of replay. always action based. not to complex to learn and lots of fun!"
12,"I think it's too late to give a review on this game. but here goes. This is the most perverted game ever made. When you think about it. it's pretty disgusting. 'Aim for the open spot!'. 'I'll do you fast. Peppy old pal.'. 'Fox. get this guy off me!' 'I've got a present for ya!' EEEEEEEEEUUU! Should kids be playing these games?Anyway. the gameplay is fun...for 15 minutes. Then it's bothersome. annoying. and dull. Your team mates have the worst A.I. ever. and they don't get power-ups. The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short. Like. 30 minutes short. Also. the voice acting sucks.I hope Starfox Adventures will be good. This game shouldn't have started the whole Starfox thing. If so. it needed work."
10,"I bought these for my Milwaukee M12 (12-volt) products since Milwaukee. unbelievably. does not make 12V bulbs and puts 14.4V bulbs in their lights which appear dim and yellow.I take away a star for either Amazon's poor packaging or DeWalt's poor protection because. in my first shipment. one bulb was exploded with glass dust all inside the package.This is an 'XPR' = xenon PR bulb rated at 0.7A.  I noted that one bulb had the filament centered. while the other was off-centered and did not give as uniform of a pattern as a result (contributes for taking away a star)."
2,"I had never known of an ice cream maker that did not require either turning the crank manually until your muscles ached. or plugging it up and listening to the awful whirring. grinding. squawking sound of the electric type. Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice. This little maker doesn't make so much noise. no mess.  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream. Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream. With the traditional freezers. you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble. This makes one and one half quarts. which is just enough for one starving person. or six normal people. It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web."
6,"I create presentation boards for design presentations and I often find myself needing to affix a piece of marble. tile or carpet to the board. Glue doesn't hold and regular tape is a joke. Scotch mounting tape. however. does the job. Normally if I affix a piece of marble it has fallen off of the board by the end of the day - I have marble still sticking to the board weeks later and no signs of letting go. This tape is amazing and. though I can't say for sure. it truly seems to be a permanent tape. Highly recommended."
1,"When I go to purchase batteries of odd sizes. like the A 23. they are usually priced at $3-$6. I have other gadgets that require an off size. If I paid retail store prices for these batteries. my money wouldn't go as far. as it is when I shop at Amazon.The tip I would give. is to have a Tupperware or similar type of container. to house all of the odd size batteries. I can buy a 5-6 pack of the odd size batteries. for a fraction of buying one from a retail store; pretty crazy."
8,"As a big fan of the Dr. Noys toy line. I was quite disappointed when this bear arrived. After searching in the bottom of the box for it. I found it drowning in the peanuts (just kidding). This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua. It's too small for our 20lb. mix. and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated. Still. our dog has tossed it around. and I've found Dr. Noy's toys to be quite durable."
8,"I used Advantage for years on our outdoor cats and always dreaded the monthly trial of applying it.  It was messy. smelled. and neither the cats nor I enjoyed it.  I started using Program a couple of months ago and couldn't be happier.  There's a lot of liquid in the monthly dose. but I mix it up with some wet food and the cats don't even know it's there.  They gobble it up and DONE.  One cat is 8 lbs and the other about double that. and neither has experienced any negative side effects.  Since Program targets flea eggs. we combine it with the Capstar tablets to address the adult fleas. as well.  It's made a huge difference. and I'm gratified to see the cats relax in comfort rather than constantly scratching and biting."
8,"I purchased this Jumbo drinking fountain to make sure my cats would drink more water.  More water they drink the less I have to worry about with urinary infections.  All my cats love this fountain.  Some drink at the bottom tray and others will drink from the top where the water is just coming out.It keeps the water cool all the time.  My only problem is when my 2 Labs come into the house and when they drink they will devour the whole thing and I have to watch to make sure that the water does not get below motor.So far I have had this fountain for about 6 months and it is very quiet. easy to install and easy to clean.Julie"
1,"We have had a couple really nice bottle brushes that have recently just given up completely and we needed replacements fast.  We looked at all the stores we regularly haunt. but did not find anything of a satisfactory type and quality.  So online I went and found this great sounding brush and decided to give it a tryout. so far it has performed flawlessly cleaning all sizes and shapes of bottles and containers of all types as well.  Overall this has been a great purchase. and I hope they have these in the future for when this one gives up the ghost in a few years..."
7,"These do everything the company says.  I was surprised at how easy larger limbs were to cut compared to my old loppers.  My wife tried these and was really pleased at how easy it was to cut limbs.  (Hint. Hint. guys)  Let me say I would not have tried to cut some of the big limbs with my old loppers (now gone to lopper heaven).  If the jaws of these loppers fit around a limb they will cut it and so can you.  Only once did I have a problem opening them (handles) wide enough to fit a limb inside a shrub. it was a big one.  Most of the time I could find an angle to reach through with and cut inside limbs with no problem.  I would recommend these to anyone who like me enjoys easy work.  At 66 years old and surviveing throat cancer surgery I need that too."
2,"I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago. I purchased the Presto 6-quart electric version. I love it. but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it. I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric. It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature. It's a good weight. great heat distribution. NOT aluminium. and sturdy. As a pressure cooker. I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully. From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month. I find I use this one three-four times a week. Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust. One of these days. I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version."
7,"The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired. but I can't complain about the adjustability. The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges.The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence. and is big enough for most medium plant pots. It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges.The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon. It seems pretty strong. and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well.For some reason. my set came with four extra metal brackets. and a ton of extra bolts. I wasn't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets. which are metal. like the entire set-up. I will probably recycle them. unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around."
5,"As soon as I got this pedal I put it on my board and noticed it had a high end hum. I have a 2 Behringer pedals on my board and a lot of people say they are bad noisy pedals.but my pedal board was silent till I put this pedal on it. I've only had it for a few days. but the cons out way the pros. Maybe I will purchase a noise reducer to help clean it up a bit. Once I get around to playing with it I will write another review."
2,"We needed a new vacuum and I could not decide on what i really wanted. So far this thing has been pretty sweet for the price. Your are obviously not going to get quiet. super cyclone. bagless. blah blah blah and I was not expecting that. This thing is loud. takes bags and has is not easy to store. But it does the job we needed and that is what counts.I am taking one star off because I really wish there was a place to clip the hose and attachment tubes to the housing for better storage. Other than that. color me impressed."
8,"I've used Nature's Miracle for years on pet stains. and found it to be the best at removing stubborn smells. but I'm always willing to try something new.I tried this Bissell Pre-Treat on some old upholstered chairs my husband purchased at a garage sale for $5. He was going to use them out in his shop so he didn't mind a few stains. but I really minded the old-dog-urine smell!After using the pre-treat as recommended. I proceeded to clean the chairs using my Bissell Spot Bot and was pleasantly surprised with the results. The chairs looked nearly new. only two small stains remained on the light colored material. Unfortunately. the smell was more stubborn. and required a re-wash and application of Nature's Miracle to finally make it disappear for good."
11,"I bought this for one of my sons because he is fascinated by the human body right now. On first glance. this is a very cool product. The book that is included is a fun. nicely illustrated introduction to the various parts and systems of the body.My kids LOVE the squish factor of all the little organs. That is fun. However. they aren't very practical. They are really difficult to get squished back into the guy once you're done. I am not letting them play with it on their own because we are using it as a resource for our science lessons in our homeschool. I think if I let them have free reign over this. it would not last very long. I also wish it had a better way of storing it. because the gummy organs are going to get dusty quickly now that we've opened it up. I will probably end up getting a shoebox-sized plastic tub to keep it in. as the box it comes in isn't going to cut it."
8,"I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't an oily topical that you have to avoid touching for 2 days until fully absorbed.  I know the flea protection works and can only hope that the tick protection works. too.  I like that it's supposed to repel ticks and lice.There is a new one out called NEXGARD that is oral. but I'm reluctant to try it since it currently only lists one tick type and isn't a repellant. so the tick has to bite the dog before it kills it."
8,"My cats enjoy eating Wellness Chicken and Herring (they didn't like the turkey). I like giving them a high quality food. But when I ordered a case several of the cans were badly dented so I did not use them. Not from shipping. because the dented cans were not on the outside of the pack but on the inside which means someone deliberately packed dented cans. This defeated my goal of saving money by ordering online. It is better for me to buy them from the store so I can be sure the cans aren't damaged."
2,"Can I say more?  Well. this neat little ice cream maker doesn't take up much space on the counter when in use &amp; stores easily -- the base is no wider in diameter than a dinner plate.  The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid. After having it in the freezer overnight. when it's thoroughly frozen. you put it on the base. fill it with the ingredients for whatever flavor of ice cream you desire. put the mixing blade in and the top on then flip the switch. About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple. You can cover the original container and slip it in the freezer for later. or you can dish it out and wash and refreeze the container -- it is very easy to clean. Also. by the way. it's the best ice cream you'll ever have. Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry."
11,"Bought this for Christmas 2012 for my daughter who was 6 at the time. She absolutely loved making this book.  You have the option of showing the kids handwriting. or having it typed. You pick a book color and its hardcover. It looks really nice and professional. We have bought additional for gifts since then.  I think it's an excellent educational gift to give. and memories can be created that will last as long as you own the book!The great part is that the assembling of the book is included with the kit that you buy here.  It's wonderful!"
3,"Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot. However. there may be more than meets the eye this time. Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details (*raises hand*). Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK. the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in 'Man of Steel.'"
1,"I use my rechargable batteries for just about everything. Be it remote controls. cameras.and flashlights and I haven't noticed any rapid deteriorating of the batteries. Recharging takes about 12 hrs but I keep extra just in case. The only issue I have had is the price - it keeps going up. I've seen them priced as high as $12 for the 4 pack. I have also seen them as low as $7.99 at Menards they average about $9.99. If you decide to use rechargable batteries just make sure you have extra ones for when they run down."
1,"This is a great little portable magnifier with light.  I bought 2 of them so I could keep one in my purse and have one for my desk.  However. my husband liked the blue one so much he took off with one and now I need to re-order!It is slightly curved so it feels good in your grip.  Closed. it measures about as long as your standard full-sized desktop mouse and about a half inch thick.  The viewing glass area is about as big as the face/screen of a flip style cell phone.  When open it emits an impressively strong light that works like a champ in the darkest of rooms. As it is an LED light it should have a very long operating life as LEDs don't require a lot of power.  Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!"
10,"This is a wonderful sander. Lightweight but good for heavy use. Hook and loop sanding parts are really easy to use. The switch is placed very conveniently. When you place the sanding pad please make sure all the wholes are aligned with the holes in the sander and give a good pressure all around and sand on the flat surface by applying some pressure. Once it's settled the sanding pad stays pretty good. Then you can sand on the uneven surfaces. If you don't follow the procedure I mentioned above. most of the times the sanding paper would fray from the sander. It is one of the most reliable tools I have ever owned. I have helped friend build three living units with this sander. Do not buy cheap Black and Decker orbital sanders."
5,"As a pro musician. I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board. I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner. Digital Delay (2 of them). Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really. really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the 'On' position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars. especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own."
7,"I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy. doesn't heat up. and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head. you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18' handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said. it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles."
8,"I'm suspicious of the packaging because I've never seen it. and it does not match the picture shown.  The package I received has a different dog on it. and the UPC has been replaced with a sticker with a different UPC on it.  I am returning this because it does not match the packaging at my vet. nor at other pet websites that sell Frontline Plus. approved in the U.S.Update: Surprisingly. Amazon will not allow a return on this item because it's considered hazardous. So with that thought in mind. buyer beware."
6,"While not being familiar with the rest of the market. I am impressed by this product.  It is like the metal book holders which I have used before. the ones that keep the pages open.  But it works with documents.  For a researcher. this is a helpful tool in order to type commentary at the computer while retaining the documents vertically.  Set up is simple.  The only problem is that the string keeping the documents in place sometimes is liable to come loose.  Other than that. I really like it."
12,"Despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System (and get used to it. because that lasts until the PS2 era-- aka. the sixth game in the series) this has to be one of the funnest games of all time. It gives a challenge on multiple levels & inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre. Was re-made as Tomb Raider: Anniversary. but I'd prefer the original any day."
3,"When is there a reason good enough to expand your family.  Dan is in love with his wife. Elle.  They have an amazing relationship. a great sex life. and a comfortable home.  So why would he want a baby?  It would change everything. and possibly not in a good way.  Elle is torn. but only because she doesn&#8217;t know what she wants to do when she grows up. but she is already grown and married.  But how would a baby fit in when she doesn&#8217;t feel that she is where she wants to beIs Dan&#8217;s love and understanding reason enough?  Read the story.  The ending will surprise you. well maybe not.Click here for your copy: Reason Enough"
10,"I have logged hundreds of hours with this saw in my hand and it never failed me. It cuts as strong now as it did when I first bought it - a good ten years ago.  I previously had a couple of Craftsmans & and an old Skil but I just gave them away after getting this.  I've used saws costing twice as much and I still prefer this old yellow friend.  She is easy to hold. feels great in your hand and sold while cutting.Of the thousands and thousands of dollars I've spent on tools. this was the best $150 I ever spent.  I usually spring for more money than I need. but I'm sure glad I didn't in this case.My youngest son just bought a house and is in need of some tools (not mine). He's getting one as a gift."
11,"I got this for my 7 yr old son to take with us while we traveled for the holidays.  I worried it might be &#34;boring&#34; to him in comparison to his DS. his books and such.  But he played this with me over and over.  I was so grateful for it while we waited 5 extra hours in the airport.  The pieces are attached. which is great for not worrying about losing them. but they are held on very tightly and we had to work hard together to turn them over.  Don't know if they'll loosen up over time."
7,"I hate to think of myself as having fun at some other creature's expense but - BWAHAHAHA. bite THIS. you bloodsucking fiends!!I first saw this being used on a vacation to St. John.  The employees in the cantina each had one. and were waving them around slowly in front of their faces. almost in a hypnotic way.  Apparently that is the best way to get mosquitoes. according to these folks (who should be VERY familiar with mosquitoes and their ways!)  If you try to swat at them too fast you will just blow them away. but if you move the paddle around slowly they will just fly right into it and go sizzle sizzle sizzle ...!  ;^)Heed what everyone says though: don't hit yourself with it while the buttons are pressed. and don't let kids 'play' with it.  It can give you a nasty burn."
10,"Used this for a week along with theDEWALT Fluorescent Area Lightfor lighting in the evenings at my cabin.  (I can charge batteries at a neighbor's.)  It performed well:  bright and easily carried with the battery attached.  Seems stable on the battery. doesn't knock over easily.  I didn't have much cause to use the pivoting head but I can imagine uses where that would be handy.  Battery life is decent. but for the price it would be nice if it was LED so you didn't have to worry about bulbs and the battery life would be longer."
3,"Wow! out of the chute action. romance and one Hot Outlaw named Cal Ryker!***************This is a follow up from RIDING WEST (believe me when I say it means Celia was 'hehehe...riding Parker West!'..not the compas direction..) I suggest ya'all read that one first!Cal is one dreamy Cowboy. with a quick draw and a reputation that sets the other 6 members of the train robbing gang to thinking twice before denying his offer to trade his share of the take for the woman they took hostage. Cal's original plan to just keep Laurel safe until he can return her to her family. goes awry when they find themselves alone for 2 weeks!.......(2 steamy weeks)What starts out as a hasty rescue winds up as more of a heartfelt romantic tale complete with smart. sassy and sexy dialogue as only Emma can conjur. This is one short tale that packs alot of romantic pillow talk and honest character development that will make you 'sigh' and beg Emma for more. more. more of those West/Evans's stories."
11,"My daughter really loves this PEG set. I would give 5 stars if there weren't a couple of problems. The yellow board the pegs fit into is foam. A harder more firm surface would be better! I was disappointed by that. The pegs fit well into each slot and they are stackable but about 3 or 4 of them did not fit into the other pegs for stacking. I contacted amazon and they refunded me $5 for the inconvenience. They did give me the option to return for a new set but I choose to keep it as my daughter really likes playing with it. Despite the fact that the bottom is made of foam. I think it will last for play thru her toddler years (she is 22months old now)."
3,"I bought this book without reading the reviews. Getting on here now. it seems that they all pretty much agreed with me. This was a fantastic story and sucked me right in. Then it just ended. It felt like I read the first third of the book and then found the rest of the pages ripped out.When you are raised as an outcast. what happens when you suddenly find yourself a queen of the people who banished your parents? Then how do you act when you find out that the last few rulers have all been murdered? Well. we don't really know because the story just ended before finishing the plot line!As much as I enjoyed the story. I would recommend waiting to see if there is a second one before reading it. If this story is going to be finished in a second book. I would definitely recommend it though.This was easy to read and the characters grab you. The only downfall was that it leaves you swinging in the breeze at the end."
8,"I had stopped using Frontline a few years ago when it 'appeared' to stop being effective on my dogs. It was on sale a couple months ago so I tried it again. I don't what they did but I'd say it improved as I found no sign of ticks (or fleas) on the pets. We are heavy with them here in Maine in the fall and so far the Frontline is doing what it suppose to. As long as it does that and doesn't have an adverse effect (which can happen) on our pets we'll continue to use it.."
5,"Not much to say here. Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player. You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style. These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great. priced great and was on sale which made it even better. There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too."
12,"To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there. the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey. the 3rd person view not help. Plus. Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh. and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen. you sad people!"
2,"I LOVE this spreader - I bought one to try it out. despite some negative reviews.  I thought. it's only $5. I'll try it.I haven't had any of the problems that others have stated.  I don't take it apart for cleaning. and I haven't seen any rust spots.  I just throw mine in the dishwasher.After using spreaders from Pampered Chef. I much prefer the Oxo spreader. as it's much stiffer & able to scoop better.  Very useful for peanut butter. cheese spreads. cream cheese. etc.  I like it so much. I'm ordering more."
2,"As many folks out there. including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers. After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual. as if for a school test. The rocker type is really totally harmless! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds. less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner. Cleanup is also very quick. The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat. which is essential for good flavor. Anne Burrell always says:&#34;Brown Food tastes Good&#34;."
10,"The factory fence sucked bad. I added the Rousseau 2600 fence system and it now a different saw. plenty of power. now very accurate. I use the portable setup in the bed of truck. sitting the saw on the tailgate at least 3 times a week ripping material for jobs. Bought this saw for $151 atHD so even happier at that price. Rousseau was $101 with all the Amazon deals available at the time. $30 off. Gold Box. and A9. Believe it or not I still like my old 2708 better."
6,"By way of disclosure. I received a sample of this product for evaluation purposes.The only guillotine trimmer I ever used with any frequency was my mother's.  It was a heavy unit. made largely of hardwood with a heavy spring-loaded arm.  It was hardly portable -- it weighed a lot.This Swingline trimmer is much lighter. with the surfaces made of plastic.  It's easy to get it out when you have a job that calls for it.It has a sharp blade that cuts paper cleanly without requiring excessive force.  It is reasonably stable on a table.It can deal with sheets of paper bigger than the standard 8.5&#34;x11&#34; size. having a 15&#34; cutting length.  If you need to trim legal paper lengthwise. this trimmer can do it.Overall. it is a fine trimmer and isn't too expensive.  If you only need a trimmer for occasional use. I'd recommend it."
7,"For starters. there are no instructions. Look at the pictures. There only two screws and they hold the body to the base...kind of. There's a door on the front. seems intuitive. but when you pick the grill up by the bail the grill tilts forward and the door flops open. Maybe I'm slow. but it took a good ten minutes to figure out what went where. Also this is a pre-seasoned grill and there are no directions as to use and preserve the coating.Edit: I just used it and could not dump the ashes. Even a cheap hibachi has wooden handles to grab. With this you have to heft it by the bail and tip it which isn't easy to do one-handed given the weight of this thing. I really want to love it. but. so far. we're not doing well."
5,"Well thought out unit that does what it says it will. drop all that POP! I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized. it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer. allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing! And then; and now for the really important part: everything stays where you last left it. Hell. even my cats can't do that. and they're porcelain."
5,"I love this pedal. I bought one used at GC the other day for $30 and never looked back. Before it I was using a Joyo Vintage OD that is also an excellent 808 Clone but this pedal is able to tweak the highs and lows better. I have it set so the level is set to 9:00. Low is set to 1:00. High is set to 9:00 and the Gain is set to next tuesday. I prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that. It also is a nice smooth OD not too crunchy.For a cheap 808 clone this is the best I have used hands down.Maxon 808 - $150Ibanez TS9 - $100Digitech Bad Monkey - $60Joyo Vintage OD - $50All great pedals for the money but not really sold that the Maxon is 2 1/2 times better."
6,"Easy to assemble!!  Sturdy!!  Works very well.  I thought the clear plastic was a good idea.. With it. you don't really need to remove the item to see your Computer screen.  It seems to be of very good quality.  I didn't give it another star 'cause I wished it would have been a bit easier to remove when needed.  It kind of 'bends in the middle' when moving it.  But. all in all a handy item to have around."
1,"I've been using the Braun cartridges for years with no complaints. The new packaging from Amazon is a nice improvement - the four cartridges are packed in a single box that is shipped as-is. Less cardboard waste than the old packaging. and a better price per cartridge.To make the cartridges last longer. re-use the plastic tab that covers the openings to keep the cartridge sealed when not in use. I run my series 7 through a cleaning cycle about once a week or so. and can get months of use out of a cartridge as long as it's kept capped to prevent evaporation."
6,"You buy a nice gift and you want to wrap it for that special person to whom you are going to give it.  You found the perfect gift wrap paper. cut the paper perfectly and fold every crease to perfection.  Now use the best tape there is to seal the deal!Scotch Giftwrap Tape has a unique satin finish that helps the tape disappear on the wrapping paper.  It seals tightly and it is easy to dispense and cut.  It doesn't yellow or show air bubbles and provides the finishing touch on the package.  Tape that doesn't show up so much that it steals the beauty of your wrapping job.Don't forget the ribbon!"
5,"Best articulate bass string for the money.  I have one of the first versions of the Fender Precision Lyte bass from the 90s.  I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued.  They sound great and stay in tune.  Sound like Rotosounds.....think Roger Glover. Geddy Lee. and Chris Squier.  Nice bright and deep sound with fingers or pick.  I am not a slap style player so I can't comment on that.  I set my action fairly high to keep every thing clean as possible. Try them. you'll like them and your bass guitar neck will be happy."
2,"this is a wonderful cooker.  The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.  Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.  The only problems I had were in the beginning.  I thought you needed to keep the pressure regulator jiggling to cook the food but if you do that the heat is too high and it burns the food so turn the heat down once it starts jiggling.  Also be careful when you wash the lid.  If the pressure plug gets caught the steam escapes and you think the cookers not working and the food will burn because you cook it too long or have the heat up too high."
12,"This game is fairly short and can be beaten in a matter of ten minutes on the easy route. but it does provide other secrets and ways to go about the game.  You can go through three main paths. but you can quirk the paths if you decide to or if you screw up on one part of the level.  You definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score.  The rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title.  The voices are also a nice added feature.  Buy this game guys."
12,"The battle system could of been a lot better.  Number one: There's too many battles in the first place.  You take three steps you get in a battle.  You walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle.  You take one step. most likely you'll get in a battle.  Also. let me point out that once you're in a battle. you can't move around.  And plus summoning whatever it is you're trying to summon. like Thunder or something. you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once.  It's hard to do.  However. I think that the game was engaging and never let ya go.  It was entertaining. and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucks$...but...the battle system could of been a lot better. I'm sorry."
8,"I don't know what it is about the Galileo. but my American Bulldogs looooove it. They will actually fight over it. I don't know whether its the shape or flavor or what. I usually get them Nylabones dura chews (as they are strong chewers) and this holds up about as well (though it is hard to gauge as they really chew this one so much more). The biggest size is much larger than the second largest size. so despite the big price jump I still think its worth it."
10,"I've been using this sander since 1976.  Back then. it was made by Rockwell.  Porter Cable bought out their tool division several years ago.  They know a timeless design when they see one and this sander needed no improvement.  This is a heavy. heavy duty orbital sander.  It uses its own weight to do the job.  Using half sheets of sand paper. it cheaper to operate over the long run over having to buy round sheets that come 4 or 6 to a pack and can be pricey.Since I've owned this unit. I've only had to replace the power cord. thats it. and it was in a production shop environment for 3 years.  I have used it in place of a belt sander at times. with an aggressive grit paper. its that good.  Highly recommended for the serious wood worker."
10,"All the settings right out of the box are spot on. No adjustments were necessary. The dust bag collected all the shavings and none were left on the ground. I was really surprised as most dust bags are virtually useless. This is a fine addition to my DeWalt tool library. The price on Amazon was less than the B&M stores and delivery was overnite with 'prime'. Always a good experience with Amazon and thats why Amazon always gets first crack at my purchases. As far as the dust bag goes. make sure you empty it frequently and Im sure you will be more than satisfied with it. Made in Mexico. not China."
2,"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.  3 were from the manual that came with the machine. and one was from the internet.  All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.  The ice cream was not creamy and melty. it was either icy or fudgy.  I like the machine. it is easy to use. but also quite loud.  We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.  I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well.  The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream. but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it."
10,"I recently purchased the Dewalt DW318 SCMS and ordered this clamp at the same time. I was disappointed when I compared the clamp that came with the saw with this one. The stock clamp has a smaller knob on the top for tightening against the work piece. and only the DW7082 has the quick release button to quickly raise or lower it. The stock clamp does have a bolt on the back of the arm that can lower it on the leg. but the fence of the saw only allows 1/4' of play unless it's slid out of the way. Originally I only ordered one DW7082 clamp knowing that the saw would already come with a clamp. but after comparing the two side by side. I ordered a second DW7082 and put the stock clamp aside. To invest in the saw and not have accessories that perform the way I want them doesn't make sense to me."
12,"i loved the first and second tomb raider's and this one is just amazing. i love the story. the graphics are good. the gameplay is really easy. and it's relatively easy. i know that many people say that this game is way too hard. but there seriously mistaken. it's really not that hard. it's much like the other tomb raiders. i still play it. it's such a good game.get this if you liked the other tomb raider games. and pay no attention to the reviews that give this game 1.2 or even 3 stars! just stick to that 4's and the 5's.oh. one more little thing... if you have vista or a laptop you may have some sound effect problems. but it usually fixes itself after you play it for a few hours."
1,"I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared. leaving just the medicine in place. I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus doesn't get immune to it. As you might know. there is NO cure for nail fungus. not even by prescription. you can only control it.  This product here is an oil. think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc. Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied. This product is no good."
3,"I have read several Shannon Stacey books and the Devlin Group series is by far my favorites!  This book is the 1ST of the 3 book series (in order:  72 hours. On the Edge. No Surrender).  I never read books twice. but I will definitely be revisiting this series and I saw on the authors website that a 4th one is in the works!  I can't say enough about this series and can definitely not pick a favorite!  I have read some other reviews on this 1st book and can't say I agree with the 3 and 4 star ratings. but for those of you who would be willing to read more. finish the series before you write a complete review."
11,"TTR is pretty much my goto game for any group of folks 'new' to modern adult board games:-very simple gameplay - draw some cards. play some matching cards. put trains on the board. lather rinse repeat-rules can be taught to even attention-deficited folk in a matter of minutes. No long boring recitation of rules. Just unpack start playing and explain while executing first turn(s).-while simple to play/teach. there is enough strategy in the game to keep more experienced players 'in' the game-short play time and quick turns prevents new players from becoming bored and losing interest. Also permits firing up an immediate second game if the first go is a hit."
11,"Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players.  Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly.  Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values.  Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play.  My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed.  Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it.  Overall it is highly recommended."
10,"I purchased this dado a few weeks ago and I would purchase it again. It comes with 2 blades. 3 chippers. spacers and shims. It's really easy to setup for the thickness you want even if you need the spacers or shims. The more common widths typically use just the blades and chippers and are really fast on setup. For example. one blade will give you 3/16 and 2 blades for 1/4. 2 blades and 1 chipper for 3/8. I've only had to use shims once on an odd ball width I needed. I have noticed some minor splintering on some edge cuts on pine. and I made a 3/8' dado that was 1/64 short. but you should always do a test cut first anyway (at least one test cut for a new width) and then you could just add a shim. I think this Dado is definitely worth the price. I'm pretty happy with it."
5,"OK. so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. I've been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything. depending on what your playing and your playing style you'll want to choose different thickness and materials. However. I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw. folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be."
10,"This is my second purchase of the Hitachi Saw. now for my son. who started using mine over 15 years ago when he was in high school.  The saw is the most precise miter saw I have used (I once bought a cheaper saw for off-site work and discarded it as unsatisfactory). much less bulky than a 12 inch saw.  has more cut capacity than the larger blade models and has smoother travel along its double rails than comparable sliding saws.  Yes. it looks expensive. but. after 15 years.  I'm glad I stretched my saw budget a bit to get a good one.  Naturally. since my son learned on the Hitachi saw.  a dad can't gift him an inferior grade."
10,"This is a great saw. and they've improved the dust collection -- my only complaint with an older model.  Buying it from Amazon/toolcrib. however. is a nuisance.  Trying to get presales support was useless. with conflicting information or tech people just reading me things from the web site.  More importantly. the delivery time they gave me was a window of more than two weeks. and it took nearly 3 weeks to get the thing.  AND. it arrived BROKEN.  Fortunately. Dewalt is sending me a new one. but clearly someone had dropped this saw along the way since the lockdown pin was bent and the handle housing was broken.  I bought from amazon only because they had a (...) when I bought the saw. but the price they quoted changed from day to day on the web site."
5,"I like thin picks myself. and this one is VERY thin. You won'tuse it all the time. but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off. it is ideal. Also. if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar. it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy. but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and it's grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most. it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!"
3,"Another great read in this series. I absolutely loved the first one and had to have the second and I was not disappointed. If anything it had only hooked me on this series even more. I love the characters and how everything interacts and flows together. It's written really well and I'm able to just immerse myself in the story and the world that has been created and I don't want to leave. even when the book is done. There is plenty of action in this story to keep your attention.  Now to get the next one :)."
12,"I am a major player of 007 games. I have played nearly every single one. but I have to say. GoldenEye is one of the best that there is. even years and platforms later. Even though I have a GameCube with all of the other 007 games. I still to this day find myself returning to play a round of Goldeneye.GoldenEye has a great plotline (in my opinion. even better than the movie) and long missions. which allow a lot of replay value. The graphics are a bit blurry. but that is to be expected in an N64 FPS.Overall. I love this game. and would reccomend it to any 007 fan."
11,"Last Night on Earth: Growing Hunger is an expansion for the Last Night on Earth game. I love it because it is so much fun! My friends and I get together once a month for game night and this is one we always pull out. This expansion add heroes. props. locations and scenarios to the main game. You do need the main Last Night on Earth board game for this add on to help you in any way. If you would like to know more about the main game there is a video on you tube from Wil Wheaton on his tabletop gaming blog style show called &#34;TableTop&#34; they played last night on earth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhLU2-BuhMIIts a great explanation of the game and how it works! However I took it to the next level and I hand painted my hero figures. I will post the images."
1,"My nails and cuticles have been so dry and were looking just awful!  Some peeling of nails. but don't think it was fungus~just cold winter and using bleach to clean while at my daughter's house with no gloves.  Ran across a bottle of this stuff while looking for nail polish. remembered how it had cleared up a toe fungus years ago. and decided to try it on my nails. just to see if it would help.  WOWOWOWOWOW! You wouldn't believe the change in my cuticles and nails in the last 3 days!  Whatever is in this stuff is just really great for dry. peeling nails. with or without fungus. dry cuticles. and who knows what else! I may try it on other skin issues now.  GREAT stuff!"
10,"I absolutely love this jigsaw. so much that I actually try to come up with projects requiring its use. Plenty of power. rock solid cutting. easy-enough blade changes. and with the Progressor blades. amazing cutting speed with great smoothness. I was. like many people moving up to this kind of tool. replacing a older Ryobi-Craftsman -- one that I thought was pretty decent -- but there's just no comparison. The Craftsman got sold at a yard sale for $4. The newer Bosch 1590 model has gotten some wishy-washy reviews. so I went with the proven performer and I don't regret it a bit."
6,"We buy a lot of paper each year.  Mead provides a good basic (cheap) paper that will no doubt meet the needs of most students. However. I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day. It's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option but for wide-ruled paper (for younger students) I think it really shouldn't be quite so thin.Pricing Note (not part of the review):The price as I write this review is $1.33 for 200 sheets of wide-ruled filler paper. That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping. If the price is higher as you read this review you may want to consider coming back at the start of the next school season and stocking when they are on sale."
1,"I have been using this product for close to a year now with my Braun electric razor.  The product works very well in cleaning and refreshing my razor.  I use it after every shave.  It has helped keep my razor sharp and non greasy. I like the fact it isn't loaded with a bunch of toxic ingredients yet it gets the facial hair and grease out perfectly.  The product lasts over 30 days for me. It also has a pleasant fragrance so when you use your razor again it has a nice fresh clean and not overbearing fragrance to it. This product will help my razor last a very long time. The price was good. The product arrived two days before estimated delivery date in perfect condition. It was packed in a Braun package so they ust have just grabbed it off the shelf and sealed and shipped it. All in all the price was good.  I love the subscription option.  It saves you a nice amount of change over time."
11,"This ship is an excellent support ship to have flying alongside the falcon or y-wings. Just don't expect a attack ship. It is a very limited ship without the upgrades.cons: the pins that come with the ships are a little flimsy and are prone to cracking. Fantasy flight needs to put out a replacement pack. With this ship in particular the pin glued to the inside of the ship snapped on the 2nd time we were setting up to play. I will need to glue it back together but I wish they were a little stronger than that."
8,"This is the only 'hard' synthetic chewy my dog is really interested in. It is slightly pliable rubbery material - but he's had others with a similar feel that he wouldn't chew as long as this. Not sure if it's the nubby texture? I bought this size hoping he could hold in his paws. but it's still a little short (he's a 20 pound dog). We end up holding one end while he chews - with his eyes closed and an expression of pure joy. He works pretty hard at it for 10 minutes or so."
5,"Arrived on time ... works as intended and maybe more.One day. I was pondering how best to de-clutter my wall receptacles from a glut of power adapters and also my table from a spaghetti of ensuing power cords used to feed various 9V-12V DC equipment on my table or rack. Fortunately. I chanced upon this little gem and in an instant ... my problem was solved. I chose the 12V adapter with the highest rated power output and used that as my primary 12V DC source and this little gem to power all the other equipment on the table or rack. I also bought another similar unit form another source here on Amazon and used that to supply the 9V DC source to power the rest of the units that needed a 9V source. Everything worked fine and I relegated the remaining adapters to storage. Been working without a problem to this day."
3,"I wrote a 'downer' of a review yesterday...then realized that I hadn't read the entire book! Silly me...This is a very good 'cookbook' with clear directions and quite a bit of good help that isn't in the basic Kindle User's Guide. I know I'll have more fun with this new best friend of mine after I finish the cookbook and start trying all the things listed that one can do. Just the thought of being able to access my Gmail while going down the road in our RV makes my mouth water. Add to that the ease of reading with larger type...well. this Western Reader is one happy gal. Thanks. David. for all your hard work!"
6,"Avery have literally set the standard for pre-cut adhesive peel-off labels and these are no different. Easy to remove from the backing (much easier than some other brands) and high quality paper and strong backing glue make these labels perfect for your label needs. I printed a bunch with a photo background and they look almost as good as a glossy print. Plus Avery always offers templates for the most used software packages (outlook. excel etc) so printing alignment and pre-filled info is handled for you so no need to perform multiple test prints before doing a proper print.It may seem like a simple thing to print onto labels but anyone who has used generic labels which don't conform to any standard will know just how many you can waste before everything is lined up. With Avery's labels the hard work is done for you and your labels will look perfect first time."
11,"I can totally see why this game was endorsed by Mensa. I bought this for my 5-year old's birthday and we just opened the box. The pieces are very nicely made. and feel high quality. It took some time teaching my son how to play the game. but he eventually picked up the basics. While it is a simple concept. there are definitely strategies that can be enacted to make this game more complicated and technical than it looks. For this reason. I believe that it would be enjoyable for a range of ages. from 5 to 100+."
7,"I love this little blower!  I can grab it at a moment's notice and blow the leaves. pine needles. and other debris out of my courtyard.  SOOO much easier than dragging out the corded electric blower for quick light jobs!  Fits my 'girl hands' nicely. not too heavy. not too noisy. lasts about 15 minutes.  For the big jobs. I'll still get out the 'monster' electric blower that works like a hurricane coming through. but with this little guy I find myself blowing leaves and stuff frequently now. instead of dreading getting out the big one for a small job.  I'm going to look at the other items they make that uses the same battery pack too."
11,"You should pick up at least one of every expansion pack to this game.  They add new pilot and upgrade cards that are quite useful. in addition to another ship.  The model is perhaps the most detailed pre-painted model at this scale I've seen. and certainly the best value-for-money in that regard.Every Rebel Squadron should have a Y-Wing. they are great support craft.  I won a pre-release Millennium Falcon with 2 X-Wings and a Y-Wing.I also suggest you buy TWO of the starter sets. so that you get double dice. spare templates. extra cards. and 6 ships to start out with."
11,"'A Creativity Tool for Innovators' is great marketingspeak. but it's a lie.After making a few patterns over the course of a few days. you and your kids will grow bored by this thing. It's more like a toy you'd buy on a lark at a dollar store; 'It looks fun. and it's only a buck.'At this price range. I expect some longevity or some real true fun. and this thing provides neither.***EDIT (three years later)*** -- my two year old boy  is now turning five. and he can't get enough of this thing. mostly because it's a BALL THAT 'EXPLODES' when you throw it or drop it."
1,"i can't say this stuff work wonders.but I can't say that it doesn't help. Consistency is the key to all work outs and lower calorie intake. There those who truly believe in this product So don't take my review to heart. It could work for you better then other people everyone is different and since we all have different metabolism and health system it will work wonders for some and for some it won't. this is a case of try for yourself and see if it works for you.  Since individual result may (will) vary."
1,"I ordered this scrub brush with the intent of using it on sinks and showers. I first used it when I threw my microfiber couch cushions in the laundry and they came out stiff. I used this brush to easily bring back the softness that microfiber is known for.Since then I have used it for sinks. tile. shower. and linoleum. It has worked fabulously each and every time and it is now my go to scrub brush. It is extremely comfortable in my hand. they did a fantastic job with the ergonomics. It is easy to apply gentle or firm pressure based on the situation.If you need a versatile brush that works well and is comfortable in your hand. this is it."
6,"I bought this paper after purchasing an Epson Aritsan 730 printer. only to see it not show very good print quality on generic printer paper.  I had tested the Epson Photo paper. and found it to be superior in quality to the HP premium paper that I had used for Photos. so I figured perhaps I needed to go with better paper for my basic printing as well.  Made a huge difference.  Text looks wonderful on it.  Paper is a nice thickness and doesn't feel as flimsy as most generic papers.  It should...afterall. it's roughly double the price of bargain paper.  But when you're looking to print something and have it look nice. better to go with good quality paper"
2,"I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another.  The first one broke after using it a three or four times. but since I like Oxo products in general. I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out. it uses tiny. metal teeth to grip the lid. which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless. so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a  spoon.  Works better than Oxo. that's for sure."
3,"So I actually started The Darkest Night first then realized this one was first so had to pause DN to read this one :PI liked this short. first look into the series. Kadence and Geryon were a heartbreaking but sweet tale. Although this story was very short and at times it seemed a little rushed. I loved the emotion behind this couples need for each other.The fact that they could forge that connection while in hell made it that much more potent.I never thought I'd like a half-beast man...oh. who am I kidding? I want aliens. vampires. Lykae. Gods and Demons at this point. Half-beasts actually seem tamed compared to that :pNow that I have the back story. I'm dying to go and finish Maddox. He was KILLING me. Ungh Violence. I'm coming back for ya baby!"
7,"This does exactly as advertised. The Black Russian Truffle Tomato i put in mine was growing famously. Actually. it's growth was fairly unprecedented. until....the whole thing fell and the plant's main stem was crushed. See. when the planter is watered properly. it is also incredibly heavy for its size. So. the lesson there would be to make sure whatever you hang it from can hold quite a bit of weight. I would say it needs to be able to hold at least twenty pounds. since the total weight of a fully grown plant with the planter and all the requisite soil and watering will at least end up weighing this much. It might be safer to shoot for 30 pounds though. However. that was a user error problem on my part for not planning properly. The planter itself is great. You cant overwater. as any excess will simply run out the bottom. A good solid and inexpensive purchase."
10,"Plan to spend an extended amount of time tuning this plane and sharpening the blade. I am operating on a very limited budget so I had to go with the cheaper route for my planes. I'll have the plane set up nicely when I'm finished with it. but it is a significant amount of work out of the box. The sole wasn't flat. the mouth wasn't square. the bed wasn't flat. the blade.... basically a butter knife. and it did take a good few hours to make it a decent tool. For a plane of this size. it wasn't a huge effort. but it is an effort and it is time spent tuning rather than time spent working wood.If you can afford it. get the rabbiting block plane from a highly reputable name instead. If not. go ahead and get this one but don't cry when it takes you hours to get it into good shape."
12,"I read alots of review about this game.alot of people said that Ape Escape was good.so I decided to buy Ape Escape for myself.Geez they were right.this game is great and fun.This is a fun game I mean I have to catch those monkey on different level and sometime each land have 4 or 6 or over 10 that each of the land that the monkey stay.There about 8 weapon/gaget that I can use to kill the enamy and to help me out on some hard place to reach.This game have 25 level and 200 monkey to catch.this game can be play for everyone.&quot;like the esrb rated said on the front&quot;.Ape Escape is mild animated violence.there no gore or bad word on it &quot;just wanted the parents to know it&quot;.I never get tired of playing Ape Escape.this is a really fun to catch the monkey.Get this game you won't be dissappointed.I haven't too!"
8,"Historically. my family has had great success with frontline. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because I know it can work (based on the flea population characteristics your dog comes in contact with).We had been using this for 2 months when my dog went to a friends house while we were on vacation. When we got back. he had fleas galore. We put on the next frontline a week early and it did not even phase the fleas on him.We switched to K9 advantix II and the fleas were gone within a couple of days. I know that some fleas are now resistant to Frontline. and that certainly seemed to be the case for the fleas on my dog. I would recommend not buying any more than a 3 month supply at a time in case your dog gets fleas like mine that aren't phased by frontline. If you try Frontline and it doesn't work. k9 advantix II might. as it did for me."
1,"man! i wish i knew about this when i was younger! I never knew that there were pills about this to help with lactose intolerance... do you guys know how much i suffered bc of milk when i was young? all that diarrhea? it sucked! One day I was like hmmm what if there are pills we can take for lactose intolerance? And there was! I was eager to try it. I'm partly lactose intolerant and It's not that severe. I only get diarrhea when I eat a lot of dairy but ti's not too bad. I take this whenever I drink milk and it does work. I don't get diarrhea like I use to. Now of course this might not work for you bc everyones body response differently to pills."
2,"My wife is from Brazil. so she is a foremost authority on pressure cookers as they use them there for almost every meal daily.Originally I tried the very cheap aluminum alternative for $15 on sale at Sears. and it failed after one use.This is better than the ones that last 20 years in Brazil. It's efficient. it's durable. it's just plain a good product. and you really shouldn't pay more for a pressure cooker than $40-$50 as it's a very simple item."
2,"I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.  It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.  The only thing you have to remember is to keep the freezer inserts in the freezer and that the ice cream will be soft when finished churning.  I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.  I wasn't all that happy with the recipes I found in the booklet (didn't want to use heavy cream or cook the base) but there are skazillions of recipes on line and after some trial and error I made up my own.  I saw some people complained of the noise. but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.  Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.  [...]  I am very happy with this purchase."
2,"The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they're spread out.  That's ok IF you use this brush to remove food from utensils prior to placing in dishwasher.If you're trying to clean pans though. this brush won't be perfect.  In that case. consider a brush just meant for that purpose such as this one:Cuisinart Round Head Brush.  Black.I recently discovered the advantage of using both kinds of brushes depending on what I'm doing.  This way. the kitchen brush isn't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items.  The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one. but I found it better this way."
1,"No kitchen should be without one of these.  This has replaced my two other dish and bottle scrubbers.  I now use this when washing dishes almost exclusively since it gets down into glasses and cleans the inside of them very easily.  I pop it into the dishwasher when I run it. It is flexible enough to get into anything but still sturdy enough to get the job done fast and easy. Works well on dishes too so it's not just strictly for bottles but for anything in the kitchen.  Nice long handle also. I wish I had found this years ago."
12,"Mega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man.  The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures.  Game play is fun and easy to learn.  The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value.  easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you'll only spend oh...one week or so one it.  Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages!!!"
10,"Was going to just build my own originally but for the price I figured I would save myself some time and buy this with the saw.  Glad I did.  Well built and works very well (can't say the same for the extension table that came with the saw). For the time I would have spent making my own it would not have been worth it.  Use this every time i use the saw.  I very rarely collapse the table down but when I do. it collapses easily and always returns to the same position."
7,"Really. this is a very effective means of pest control. The safety feature of having two buttons pressed in order to activate it. and having them displaces so you dont accidentally turn it on is nice. When you strike. you get a big blue jolt. which from my experience. makes it fun for the kiddos. Also. i touched the racket while it was on....the current is definitely pretty strong. It wont kill a person. but it does hurt. which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much. much smaller insects. They dont always die first zap. but it always stuns them at the least. allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $10 IMO."
3,"I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have passed over this book. It just did not look that interesting and it seemed like this was the one and only book written by Samantha Cruise so it cannot be that good. can it?Boy was I ever wrong! This is the most eroctic. most sensual. most passionate. most sexiest. hottest. steamiest. most graphic book I have ever read. Did I say hot. did I say sexy. did I say extremely eroctic. then let me repeat myself again! I am not sure if Samantha Cruise has written any other books and to date I have not been able to find any but I hope she writes more books. This book was so hot that made I left my husband a very happy man! I would highly recommend this book! Great Job Ms. Cruise!"
2,"Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker. It's so easy and the results are amazing. I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream. It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find. Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream. I've made mint chip. premium vanilla bean and strawberry. I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream). Sorry. Haagen-Dazs. I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!"
11,"Why do all the best board games originate from Europe?I read about this game on an on-line game site. highlighting some of the best family board games out there. and this is one that made the list. It looked fun and easy-to-learn. so I picked it up in time for the holidays. I had a lot of fun playing this with my family over Thanksgiving and Christmas get-togethers. The game is simple to learn. simple to play. and is really pretty casual. There's a small amount of luck and strategy involved. but most people can play this on an even footing and it is not geared towards competitive game-play. More fun with the full five players on the board. it can still be finished in about 1 hour of play. I highly recommend trying this game out!"
7,"This past summer I tried a charcoal grill for the first time and as a result my gas grill was never taken out of the garage.  It's become an obsession of mine and now I have three different grills. one smoker and a collection of different wood chunks.  My newest obsession never would have taken root if there was not an easy. foolproof way of starting the lump or the briquettes.  I don't have any other chimney to compare this to but it works perfectly every time.  Two sheets of newspaper. dump in your fuel of choice and light it.  10-15 minutes later the coals are ready to go.  If you think the newspaper gives too much ash try paper towels sprayed with some cooking oil instead.  If you grill on a deck be careful when you light it or where you put it after dumping out the coals as it gets very hot."
7,"I feed birds all winter and the sparrows. cardinals. finches. etc. - all come to eat.  In past years water that wasn't ice was the one thing they needed to sustain them.  I bought this to use in a birdbath so that my birds could drink. as well as. eat all winter.  It's very economical to use and the birds think it's just a rock at the bottom of the bird bath.  I'm very pleased with this item.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in keeping our &#34;feathered friends&#34; going over the winter."
12,"Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).Some championship races and cars can only be 'unlocked' by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally. and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it. be sure to rate it as helpful."
6,"These labels are nice. thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're made for reusing packaging/mailers with a more professional appearance than traditional labels. which allow the previous printing to show through. They're completely effective at blocking what they cover. and the print jam-free in my laser printer in both the tray and single-feed input. They peel easily from the backing. and very easy to handle because they're thick and don't roll when you remove them. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label. due to the gray layer on the adhesive side. which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. They're crisp looking labels. and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something."
10,"It sure is nice having a flash light that I always know there is a fresh battery in.  This is the case because I have multiple of the 12-volt DeWalt batteries and always keep one on the unplugged charger fully charged and ready to swap out for a dead battery. This flashlight is well balanced and feels nice in the hand and turns on and off easily with the thumb of the hand holding the light.  My only complaint is that it eats the battery up pretty fast. I am unable to make a run to the outhouse and back without the flashlight going dead (or at least very dim).  And I don't stay seated long.  I end up turning it off while seated."
6,"This can come in handy for different home projects and decorating. For example. I decorated a huge bathroom mirror with small framed pictures using this double sided tape. it looked great. Perfect when you can't or don't want to ruin a wall with a nail.  I also decorated the ceramic tile backsplash in the kitchen with the same sort of small framed pictures.  The tape is not too hard to remove from the glass/mirror/tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls.  A little sanding of the residue is needed."
7,"Pricey? Yes. but well worth it!!  I have purchased many bird feeders over the years (including Duncraft) but this feeder is the Rolls Royce in design. construction. durability and ease of use (filling. hanging).  Squirrels have eaten the last of my birdseed - this one will definitely keep them out - so ingenious!  I also purchased the weatherguard to protect the birds. as well as the seed. from the elements. I am sooooo impressed with this feeder - I hope the birds like it as much as I do!  (ha-ha)The weatherguard was a little tricky to install but if I can do it. anyone can!  Just follow the instructions that come with it."
8,"I guess I'm in the minority.  I had heard that these were a problem and shrugged off the warning as one from the few malcontents having a bad day and bought this.  Good chewing BUT.....they made my dog sick and he barfed five times.  And guess what came up?  And. yes. the sharp little edges were still there.  No more nylabone products for me. I feel so strongly about the danger of these products that I am making the effort to go to every nylabone product on Amazon to post this warning.  mb"
6,"I do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price/design ratio.  The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it.  The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair. with two plastic attachments to it. For this price a few extras should have been included. I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply cannot handle the weight.Overall. it works ok. but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect."
2,"This is my second Eureka.  The first a Eureka  100 - a BIG Floor standing Model.  This died on me after fifteen years.  Was too big and heavy.The Mighty Mite was ordered and delivered within one week.Tried it out the same day - This machine S U C K S !! (I mean the DUST)The lightweight is very handy.  Did my 3 Bedroon unit with upstairs and stairs without much effort.  The extra brushes. and long handle and tubes are very good for window sills and odd corners.  Does hard floors well.The free shippind was a great help.  With a little addition to qualify for FREE SHIPPING - I got the Bissell Featherweight Bagless. which I ordered together for areally great deal.A very good buy through Amazon.  Very Happy with machine. Thanks Amazon for assisting  in the Free Shipping."
11,"My nephew-in-law got engaged  and the last couple of Christmases Jessica got gifts from me from The Body Works which was good. but this year I gave her this game and she went nuts. She brings it over every time she comes. My husband and I  have played this for years. It is one of the  very few games that  is good for 2 people. You just use 40 cards instead of the whole deck. If you are looking for a good game for 2 people. this is it. Each hand is quick and you can stop at any time. You can earn bonus points if youare lucky. What more could  you ask?"
3,"Author Steve Peek will have me sleeping with the lights on for a while. I thought I was over being afraid of the dark. but not after reading this book... Why do I need the lights on?Answer: Longclaws...Steve Peek's writing style is masterful. unique. Just take a peek between the covers... He has written a story that addresses the human condition. our capacity to deal with the unimaginable. and find a way to carry on. I totally enjoyed everything about this book: the plot. the characters. the style. the pace. its unpredictability. and above all. even my coming nightmares when I turn out the lights! I highly recommend this book.Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofStory Tellers: In Pursuit of Happiness"
3,"I wouldn't say that Crystal Jordan's 'Treasured' is a spanking novel.  I would say that this book is an erotic novel containing a lot of sex with a spanking or two thrown in for good measure.  That said I still really enjoyed this book.  The focus may not have been on spanking. but it was still a hot read.Becca was the perfect protagonist.  She was strong. independent. and could sword fight better than a man.  But when she and James were together. she was completely submissive.  Her loyalty to James was both sexy and endearing.If you are looking for a steamy novel to read. this one is perfect for you.  It is well written and keeps the reader engaged.  I only wish it had a few more spankings amidst all the spicy sex.Katerina of BottomsUpBookReview"
7,"I like the 10' size.  It holds a substantial pot. whether you change the plant three times a year. or keep one perennial as I do.  The holder goes onto your deck rail in a few minutes.  While it is not heavy duty. it will hold even a tall pot easily and securely.  Holds enough soil for a second story deck like mine to trail a vine twenty feet. or a huge Swiss or trailing begonia.  Not much else to say except no problems and sturdy enough to last for years."
7,"We had a woodchuck last year. a big woodchuck. that decided to set up camp in our backyard.  She(I believe it is a she) ate everything she could get to. nothing was safe.  Thankfully the vegetable garden had a fence but we lost half of our unfenced flower garden.  As soon as things started sprouting this year I started spraying but not what I thought was excessive.  We have not seen our big friend in our garden this year but I did see her in a neighbors yard the other day so I'm hoping it was the Havahart Deer Off and not that she moved to a better neighborhood.We don't have a problem with rabbits or deer and the only issue we have with squirrels is they like to bury nuts in our garden and flower boxes in the fall. so we will see how it goes with them later in the year. The sprayer works well and I'm really interested to see how long the pump lasts and will update as to that also. Recommended."
1,"We buy these for my 89-year-old mother.  It is so much easier than having a little bottle that she cannot get the top off of.We buy them on Amazon.com because we live in a remote area of Montana and shopping is 60 miles one-way away (besides. the prices are up to 40% higher and with Amazon delivering FREE to our door within 48 hours. why go anywhere else?)Anyway. these are the same name brand I have bought elsewhere for a lot more and they are excellent."
8,"Cheap 'n' cheezy. just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older. sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market. since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags. but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid. so have to be replaced despite being lined."
6,"This is nice thick card stock that does not bleed through. I used these for invitations and printed a full color picture on front. black & white print with a color image inside and a color image on the back. They looked fantastic! Of course I did need to keep the pages separated for a minute. so the ink could dry. but nothing smeared and they looked fabulous. The only trouble I had was that I couldn't find an option for this Avery size in my Word 7. so I used what I thought was closest to that size and it worked just fine (and that is why I didn't give it 5 stars). I would definitely purchase these again!"
2,"OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things. there is so much you can do with them.use them to store stuff in a home/apartment. on a vacation. a fishing trip. the list of uses is limited only by one's imagination.I have a 15 gallon one(not sure if they still make this size) & I thought that held a lot...this one is so much bigger & roomier...the 24 gallon holds almost 2x more than my 15. & is built just a solidly as the former.After filling this. it can be used for extra seating. a footstool. an extra table maybe...These things are built like a rock!!These are like the ultimate in storage boxes.Would I recommend this to my friends?  yes I would."
7,"You will not be disappointed with any Fiskars product. and no. I do not work for the company. Wish I did. All the Fiskars axes adn hatchets are wonderful. I went a little crazy a few months ago and ordered about one of every size axe/hatchet that Fiskars make and I love each one equally. The handle. the look. the design. the price. This is a top of the line product. Anything else other than a a Fiskars is a waste of your time and money. Ohhh. Just had a thought....I did buy the Fiskars sharpening tool as well. The Fiskars sharpening tool is a piece of junk. It broke when I tried to use it the first time and I was completely unimpressed. but I did not return it to the vendor. too much hassle. The axes/hatchets are GREAT though and you will love them."
7,"Purchased this item at 11 AM.  Used free supersaver shipping. Received the next day. Unreal.  Apparently these are stocked in local warehouses. I live in a small Ohio city. The tracking number immediately showed a UPS exception. This was a first. The product itself is nice. Well made.  Easy to use.  Some commented on the shipping carton.  It was a long box. with 2 separate box pieces taped together.  The UPS man told me it looked like it may be damaged.  It was fine.  I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage. The box is so odd shaped that nothing else will be piled on top. This will be a useful product. Added:  Minor dissapointment.  Just saw this in my big box grocery store for $ 69.00-full price. This is a full price store-not a discounter."
5,"I like them. but these strings are probably not for everyone. The EXP16s do provide a crisp. bright sound almost leaning towards metallic. This tone is actually refreshing on my old shallow-bodied Ovation. However. I have to imagine that on a dreadnought or jumbo this sound might be quite different.While I was not expecting it. my favorite aspect of the EXP16s is the playability. The play is a little more elastic than I thought it would be. and they are amazingly easy on the fingers.The only downside that I experienced with the EXP16s is the fact that. while giving once on the guitar. they are a little brittle off the guitar (I almost snapped my E getting it set up). Other than that. the strings are just a little squeaky. I personally like a little squeak. but at the current price point. I don't think that it would be a deal breaker even for those who don't."
6,"I've now owned two shredders.  The first one. I decided didn't need to be oiled -- despite the owners manual telling me otherwise.  What do I care if the blades are oily?  They just spin and cut. right?  I never have to oil my scissors......wrong.  After a while (albeit a few years). the shredder blades simply stopped working.  Paper was getting stuck in the strangest of places and I guess the motor eventually burned out.Enter the second shredder and a new bottle of Fellowes Shredder Oil.  I'm following the manual with this one and you should too.  Different oils are meant for different purposes. so get one that's meant for a metal shredder.  This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long. long. time."
11,"My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep.  This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out.  The new quests. intrigue. and building cards are great.  Adds some new fun ways to play.  I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though.  Some of them are shoe-ins to win the game and others are almost impossible.  My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play.  I'm sure other people have been thinking the same.... But other than these new lords. the new game play is fun!"
8,"sure. i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner)!! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can! Which means my doggie can run much farther too! Which means she gets tired faster! and goes to sleep sooner!! this is the best thing ever created!!!! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way) she goes insane!! it also doubles as a water bowl. one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot. I had my camelbak on but i didn't bring her water bottle. I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that. pretty nifty. eh?"
12,"Whatever happened to the days when games were made to be fun?  Whatever happened to the days where replay value was through the roof and graphics were not as heavily emphasized? This game is well over 10 years old now and it is still fun to play.  Even in this day and age I see kids enjoying it.  This should be one of those games that developers look back upon and say what made that game so much fun?  What can we learn from this aside from improving upon the old school 3D graphics?  Spyro may not be the best game of all time but it certainly is a fun one for me that I have had a lot of fond memories playing."
7,"Received this Toro for Father's Day and I love it. Sweeping and raking are two of my least favorite yard chores. and this unit has instantly become one of my indispensible tools. Although I was able to vacuum up green hedge trimmings w/o any real problem. I went ahead and ordered the replacement impeller from the heavy duty Ultra model (they are interchangeable). for an additional $30. I was going to mount it right away. but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears. then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this. as the magnesium impeller is very light. yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra. which helps at the end of the day."
1,"I've tried many different lotions & creams to end up with dry. irritated (sensitive) skin. Nothing seemed to work. At first the price of this made me now want to try it. because if it didn't work I was out that money & left with a bottle to pawn off on family.After just one use (after showering) I put this on & my skin didn't feel tight. dry. itchy or irritated. My hands are always cracking & itchy because of washing so much during the day & now I can go a couple washes without adding more lotion.My skin is really soft. not oily or greasy & I will continue to use this lotion for how ever long I can afford the luxury of buying it. I'd recommend to anyone with sensitive. dry or problem skin."
11,"Our 3 year old loves animals and fell in love with this puzzle at first sight.  After a little coaching from us. she is now able to work on putting it together all by herself.We enjoy doing puzzles at our house.  They are a great educational tool and can be a nice quiet time activity.  I often get this out to keep her occupied while I'm cooking dinner.  It has been fun to talk about all the animal names and remember our own trips to the zoo.The packaging and pieces are both good quality.  This puzzle contains 25 pieces and forms 22x22 square.  The puzzle itself is very colorful.  There are a lot of fun. interesting things to see in it.  This would make a delightful gift for any young animal lover."
2,"When I used the ricer. I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out.  They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps.  My family was disappointed as well.  They were looking forward to the light. creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer. but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side. it is sturdily made. and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles.  If you have any problems with your hands. this is definitely not for you.Overall. it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
10,"I've used this joiner on various projects over the last couple years. finding it functional and easy to use. but when I recently put it through some considerable work I was seriously impressed. I just made around 400 slots in order to build a half dozen chopping boards. It cut through both jatoba (Brazilian cherrywood) and maple like butter. making clean. consistent. and accurate slots. The blade is very high quality. The dual rack-and-pinion fence is very accurate. easily adjustable. and stays where you set it cut after cut. The gauge is easy to read. a plus when your protective eyewear is covered in sawdust. The preset stops make it easy to choose the proper slot size too."
12,"This is where the epic Resident Evil series began. The first adventure see's you tackle zombies. snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion. which is very atmospheric. Don't be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes. bear in mind that this was made in 1995/1996 and so for the times it's pretty good. This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series' of games on the Playstation. The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star game is the slighty disapointing ending. But this is only a minor flaw. and this is still one of the best games on the Playstation."
1,"This product changed my bladder problems from bad to better. but I still have flow problems.The main thing is that a full 6 tablets caused me to have spells of disorientation. I take no drugs. so it wasn't a compatibility issue. I now take 1 in the morning and two at bedtime with no ill effects. The full dose of 2 three times daily caused me problems.I am 68 and a major cancer survivor. but I don't think that affected it.UPDATE: 3/26/2013Working well now. I have chronic bladder problems. but I take 2 tablets in the morning. 1 in the afternoon. and 2 at night. I think I've adjusted to it now. Still have some flow issues. but the bladder discomfort is long gone. I recommend it! Better than Rx drugs.TaosGuy"
2,"In my humble opinion. most of blenders are not great.  The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit. I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.  So if you are doing a lot of entertaining. you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.  You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down. Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients. Also. you should look at the recipe book.  The recipe book gives you hints on how to 'layer' the ingredients.I made some awesome hummus by following their directions.As I said earlier. if you are doing heavy blending work with ice you may need a professional unit.  I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill."
10,"I purchased the Dewalt because their tools are historically of good quality. This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper (my little mouse sander does better job) and as for other features. I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect. But my variable speed option still works though.  After using it on a project for about 20 hours. the bearings went and I had to get it fixed.  Once this sander quits on me. I think I'll opt for the Porter Cable."
5,"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills. tough as nails. and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals. this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail. or get up close for some bass response. or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic. 25-ft cable. cable tie. carry pouch. and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra."
2,"My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker. but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it. I got this 4-quart one several weeks ago. and I am super happy with it!!  I have been pulling an entire beef top round and pork shoulder straight out of FREEZER to cook in pressure cooker. and I was able to serve dinner in an hour.  It's perfect for a poor planner like me.I did read the manual over and over to make sure it is safe. and yes. it is safe!"
3,"I read this and felt the tears coming. How moving. I'm not certain if it was just me being overly emotional. but this book lead me to tear up and weep along with the stories.I've always imagined that I would be reached by loved ones and that they would send me the message that is necessary for my moment - a moment of encouragement. What a true blessing (and I don't use that b word much) for those to have received such a gift. Reading about it gives clarity. insight. and hope. so I can imagine that those who are actually touched by these events must be clearer about life and living."
8,"I saw fleas after having been using an oral medication for my dogs--it seemed to have STOPPED working..threw the kids in the tub...bathed them - then RAN to PetsMart and bought the Advantage....in less than 24 hours my dogs STOPPED scratching and slept the night.  I have ordered their next doses from Amazon...but at the first sign of the fleas I wanted IMMEDIATE action..LOLand per another reviewer I did in fact notice a whiff of 'altered' breath on one of my (small) dogs---but it was't awful--but definitely 'changed'"
1,"I suffer from year round allergies with nasal congestion constantly. This saline mist is the best I have tried. It is not drying like the others. The spray bottle is easy to use and gives off a nice mist spray. not alot of fluid just to run back out your nose. I have purchased other spray bottles that were so hateful to use such as the spray hole too small. or the bottle loses it's shape making it hard to squeeze. etc. This mist does the job I need it to to moisten and help clear my nose..sorry gross. Great price here at Amazon also. I'll be buying it again."
1,"I have been using these for several years now.  I wish they would last longer than they do for there is a bit that evaporates over time.  But. it does a nice job cleaning the shaver.  It is recommended to NOT refill these with alcohol. although i often check these and when they are around 2/3's full. i will add some alcohol and fill it back up.  I do it only the one time and this makes them go further.I did that once when the unit was about 1/4 full... and it actually made it more difficult to get my shaver clean.  However. at 2/3's full or 3/4's full... and then adding some alcohol... that works well and i get an extra 2 week'ish.Thanks."
8,"My Rottie has food allergies to poultry. beef and dairy. I've had a difficult time finding a toothpaste that doesn't make him allergic and he enjoys the taste. This toothpaste is peanut flavor (smells like black licorice). He loves the taste and doesn't wiggle as much when I brush his teeth every night. The price is ok. but I do wish that the tube came in a larger size. Soooo. if your pup has allergies or doesn't like his/her current toothpaste you might want to try this one."
10,"This is one of my all time favorite power tools. It's easy to load and it's super smooth to operate. I keep the clamp lever attached to the power cord using a zip tie to make sure it's always handy. It also helps a lot to use it out doors if possible but if you are using it indoors try and have some air/filtration dust collection solution to protect your lungs and keep your home or workplace clean. There have been a few times when the counter-balance got stuck so it vibrated but if you power it off and tap it with your hand a few times the balance will free up and all will be vibration free again."
5,"I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive. yet lightweight. flexible. and of more than acceptable quality. The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness. which feels nice at first and feels 'more studio.' but when you're actually using the cable. it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things. For instance. Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are.For just a few bucks more. I prefer Pro Co Excellines. since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler. just call Sweetwater). which feels nicer to me. but I like these just fine."
12,"This is my all time favorite wrestling game ever made I really enjoy this game alot the modes you have are exhibition tag team special matches like 2 on 1 you have also a 40 player battle royal which to me is my all time favorite feature in this game what so ever winning the titles in this game is alot of fun and to me this game is alot better than the overrated smackdown here comes the pain and it is alot easier than that game as well I don't get why people say smackdown here comes the pain is so great when in reality it sucks because the ai in season mode is very cheap and I hate ai like that but in this game on easy mode the ai is way to easy but to me this game is just awesome and I still play this game alot to this day I never get tired of it."
6,"I've been using Avery labels for years. primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE. it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. Word has templates for labels. so once you find 8660. enter your text and hit print. The clear address label does go on completely clear. which would especially be useful when using high quality paper. such as sending out wedding invitations."
12,"Unfortunately this game is just a hodge-podge of elements from the other games.  There are some interesting new units. and I did enjoy the much larger maps.  My biggest complaint is that it is so short.  You are just getting to use some of the more advanced units and the game is over.  You never get the big final battle like at the end of the last two incarnations.  This is by far the shortest game of the bunch.  I finished each side's campaign over the course of three nights. about 9-12 hours of game play."
1,"I haven't even received this yet. but I've used it years ago for warding off sinus infections and colds. It washes out germs from your sinuses and is very soothing if you already have a problem that started. Helps heal the sinuses. I also use 8 oz. heated filtered water with a quarter teaspoon sea salt dissolved in water and pour it down my sinuses over the sink which works. too. But this in a bottle is more convenient and an excellent price and a huge quantity so you don't have to buy for a long time."
6,"1.  For baseline. I have used an Epson 1280 for the past two years.2.  The only reason to get this printer is if one wants longer life prints.  The print quality / image is MORE difficult to achieve with this printer--not impossible. but more difficult.  Overall. the paper profiles are fairly good (epson papers)--the colors are fairly accurate.  However. the prints are definitely &quot;flatter&quot; (ie less contrast. less saturation) compared to the 1280--this can be worked around to a large extent by simply increasing contrast (esp the black point) and saturation...around by 10 points.3.  Overall. I like the 1280 prints better to a slight degree. but if viewed by itself without a comparison print. the prints from the 2200 are good.  Furthermore. with the increase in print life. overall it's a decent compromise for me.  One has to evaluate their own priorities to see if it would be worth it for them."
7,"SO living on a mini ranch I got this to cut down on flies and mosquitoes.  The mosquito attractant did a good job. but didn't last that long. and was expensive to replace. The pesky 'flies' go to bed at night so they aren't attracted to it.  Otherwise it would just attract 'non pesky' bugs in my opinion like moths and I felt really bad hearing them sizzle and zap when they didn't bother me. One night I went out and noticed there was a lot of moths and huge ones all around the bug zapper. I felt like they were trying to tell bugs and moths to stay away. so I took it down.. I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside. and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy. but that is how I feel :)"
1,"I've been using the Mach3 for so long I literally can't remember using another blade. To me all blades are expensive but getting these through Amazon has saved me over twice the amount that my local store charges. Good deal plus I didn't have to go in a store to get them. I'm not what one would call hairy so I'm easy on blades. One will last me about a month shaving once a day. I get a clean close shave from the Mach3. If you are new at shaving make sure you do it correctly because if you don't then no blade will be good to your face. There are plenty of tutorials online so look for one. I suggest 'Shaving Tips From Gillette'."
7,"I have this attached to my rails on my back porch.  I just planted a bunch of geraniums(red and white)and put the pot into the holder when I was done.  Very sturdy-that was one thing that I was afraid of was that it was going to fall over. But the brackets are very firm-dont think I will have a problem with them this summer.Nice product. It looks better when you get it. When I saw it on Amazon it looked very cheap but not when you get it.Might buy a couple more to match the one I just got!"
10,"This a fine quality machine. It really is very basic and quite simple in its design. Although not as refined as some sanders out there this unit does one thing well. SAND.The ability to adjust the speed is a must on any sander.This tool will easily withstand the daily rigors of loading and unloading your work truck.I do recommend upgrading the sanding shoe and I wish porter cable offered that as a standard.From the rugged american craftsmanship to its simplicity and fair price this tool is a big hit.Two thumbs up on this one.Now get out there and sand something."
12,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character. (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
12,"All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together. The great thing is that theres no real violence at all! Mario can perfect his fireball move. Fox McCloud can shoot his laser. Link can throw boomerangs and bombs. while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers. All characters have different special attacks. They can all punch and kick. but they all throw. smash. pound. pummle. blast and burn diffrently. Also. items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents. Pokeballs. (which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things) swords. hammers. Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field. With an awesome multiplayer option. this is a sure Nintendo Classic. Try this game. you'll fall in love with it fast."
5,"As a beginner guitarist. a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks. partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully. that makes sense).  However. when I was handed one of these. it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say. now that I have my own guitar. I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed."
2,"It's does not vac at all.  I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica. they worked great.  Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well.  My only good vac was the upright that's cordless.  It does not clean very well. but does the everyday job of picking up dirt.  My ex-wife got it and still using it.  I need to get one.  Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too.  Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy.  3 strikes. your out Hoover.  I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
2,"I have owned this can opener for 3 years now and I am still mostly happy with it. It features comfortable rubber grip handles and an ergonomicle hand crank (my favorite part). Due to the design. I notice less stress and strain on my hands and wrists using this product than I had with cheaper models. I have not noticed any rusting or other problems as far as functionality is concerned. The rubber handles have loosened a bit and slide down occassionally. but this has not been problematic as of yet. All and all it has been a good product and if I ever needed a new one. I would be willing to buy this same model again."
2,"This peeler works very well. comfortable handle. Stays sharp.  Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe. too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless. The leverage is wrong at the tip of the peeler blade.We own an older model OXO Good Grips peeler with the potato eye removers at the base of the blade. near the handle.  Much. much better. The eye removers near the handle are easy. quick. and accurate.This older model has one eye remover on each side. so it works equally well for right-handers and left-handers.Sometimes the best model does not win in the marketplace."
2,"I rather enjoyed this peeler. In fact. when I first used it. I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel. This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure. The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand. The head swivels a bit so the blade can adjust to the contour of the vegetables quite easily which is necessary when you are peeling things like potatoes. I am glad I bought it."
11,"I am very impressed with the quality of this skirt; it is very well made.  This is our seven month old daughter's first holiday and her elf just arrived tonight on Thanksgiving Eve.  We added this skirt and other accessories of our own to personalize her a bit more.  She now has a pom-pom on her hat. a bow. and even pearl earrings!  She looks so sweet!  I uploaded a picture...check it out :)I highly recommend the skirt if your elf is a female.  It really adds something special to this already spectacular elf!  Happy holidays :)"
11,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong. but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player. and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly. I usually loose. but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
7,"Using peanut butter and marshmallows in a papercup as bait I have trapped and transported 4 out of a family of 5 raccoon away from my Koi pond.  I take them 8 miles away and release them near a small river.  Only one left is one of the teenagers. I'll probably get them next week.  If I had hired a &#34;critter getter&#34; to trap them. they would have killed them which I didn't want.Easy to set. easy to pick up without exposing yourself to the animal inside.  I like the way it opens. I cover the trap with a towel so they can't see me and just pop the door up.  The minute they see the opening. they are gone.If you are going to transport them remember that it is against the law in some areas.  Also recommend that you put some wood underneath the cage in your car to protect your interior.  Anything they can reach they will try to use to claw their way out."
8,"There's a good article comparing the flea products: [...]The condition of the surrounding and pets all need to be considered before choosing the right product that suits your needs. I have a cat and dog. My dog is a flea magnet and the only product that works for him is Revolution and I love the fact that it's a heart worm prevention med also. However I put the cat on Program since she is an indoor cat and I feel more comfortable using this on her because my dog licks my cat but not vice versa. I use the Greenie pill pockets to wrap the tablet and has no problem at all enticing her to eat it. So far this combination works perfect for me. Every animal is different. It takes a little trial and error to find the best product for that animal specifically."
7,"Very happy with the product.  The heat is consistent and I love the ability to adjust airflow.  The only suggestion and reason for 4 starts instead of five is that condensation tends to drip out.  The plastic could have been moulded with the lip turned up and drain ridges put in which would have kept the condensation in.  It doesn't pour out or anything but I've had to put a piece of cardboard and a garbage bag under the unit to prevent it from ruining my table.  Also happy with Amazon shipping to Japan for me since. even with shipping. it's cheaper than what is available here.  Will definitely be ordering more Hydrofarm products in the future."
5,"People complain that these aren't really rolling string trees. despite the fact that the description *never* says or even implies they are. in fact. 'rolling' string trees.  Honestly. they don't need to be. at least for most guitars.  These small. round guides are superior to the flat. wider styles of most string trees because they have way less actual contact with the strings.  Less contact means less friction. less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don't have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move.I put them on a cheap Telecaster copy I have and noticed the results immediately. and I did not replace either the tuners or the nut. those are still the cheap stock parts.If you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot. rollers might be a little better. but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade (anyone can change them. all you need is a screwdriver). it was a no brainer for my Telecaster."
7,"As others have stated these gloves do have an over whelming &#34;plastic&#34; smell to them when first opening the package. but that smell did go away. They do repel heat fairly good. but my gripe with them is that they are waaay to slippery. You cannot grab any type of meat or pull any meat apart as your hands will slide all over the place. I didn't use them to grab any hot metal objects. so I cant comment on that. But I rarely use them now only to grab meat from the grill (with a fork or thongs as I don't trust these gloves and the meat might slip out of my hands) and place them on a plate or cutting board. so for what I paid I cant be to upset. Also I didn't want to get water inside the gloves when cleaning them because I didn't know how the glove would dry being wet so I wear them and wash them as if I am washing my hands with warm water and soap."
6,"This divider/label kit helps you step by step through the process of printing labels for your dividers. either with a downloaded Word template (which I used. with Word 2003) or online.  (Word 2007 comes with the template already. according to the package.)  Once you download it. it will appear under an 'Avery' tab when you open the 'New Office Document' menu.  I tried printing both text and picture labels. and fed the label sheet twice through the printer - it came out looking great and was as easy to apply as in the photo.  You can also print labels for both the fronts and backs of your tabs at the same time.  There is even a test printing sheet as well as extra labels to attach separately in case you want to reuse old dividers.  The binder is also very nice. with a rubber-coated lever and two pockets inside both the front and back covers."
1,"I had purchased (on Amazon) a battery operated remote door bell which I added to my front door.  Needless to say. the little 12 volt battery that came with the doorbell was an unknown brand and didn't last very long.  I could not locate the replacement battery in my local area grocery and drug stores.  I looked on Amazon and sure enough. they had them available!  I was especially pleased the batteries were Energizer. exactly the type I needed. and was a two-pack!  I really do tell my friends that if they can't find something. or if they do and it's too expensive or too far to drive to get it. look on Amazon!"
4,"Because this is one show I watched in the 90s and never forgot. I was grateful to find it on DVD now.  And there is a bonus of episodes from a follow-up series to the original. something I missed when it was aired.  Michael Kitchen is a riot. sublime in his comedic delivery.  The romantic leads are wildly hot.  All the supporting actors are perfectly cast.  There is one actor whose accent is so thick. I barely understand what he says; however. his acting is so clear. I totally get what is going on in his scenes.  There's a brief scene with a dog....  You don't want to miss any of this program."
11,"This is an amazing game for any Zombie enthusiast. First of all I have only played one other board game and that is ZOMBIES!!!. Now that is a good game but this one truly blows that one out of the water! First of all you get these sturdy game pieces and lovely plastic miniatures. secondly you can choose different types of scenarios that change up the game ...think of it as choosing a different zombie horror movie and lastly it is encouraged that you make your own scenario. They supply you with extra pieces so you can modify any scenario or make your own. The rules do take a game or two to finally master. but once you have got it down its all fun and mayhem afterwards."
2,"I picked up a OXO Y-peeler. like the above model. except with a red inlay on whim in Krogers. about.. 5 to 6 years ago? I still have it and it works great! Tried to take good care of it.This peeler is perfect if you have Big hands. and want a functional peeler. and want to peel manually like nobodies business. Used to use a peeler. that wasn't a Y shape. but was just straight with a long U shaped point blade. My hand cramped up so bad all the time! And I'm a young guy. So I got this and have never looked back.I absolutely love this kitchen tool!Anyways. this will be a good investment when peeling potatoes or carrots. Haven't really used it on anything else."
4,"I don't really want to talk about the religious aspect that everyone is arguing about... I just think that this is a great movie. It is done very well and looks stunning. The acting was great. It is a violent movie and I don't think anyone knows for sure if Jesus' death was that violent... in fact I don't think anyone knows for sure if God even exists (that's why they call it faith right?) People who say they are 100% certain that God exists are always whack jobs. People who say they are 100% sure that God doesn't exist are just as whacky. But one thing is certain. this is a very entertaining film that is done well and really should be considered one of the best movies of all time."
12,"At first glance this game may look easy but its not.You could spend many hours just trying to figure out what everything does and even more making your numerous attempts at unsuccesful cities.The graphics are pretty good  but you need an intense system for the game to run smoothly.Maxis has once  again added their own humorous touch to the game which can add to the fun  factor.You probably won't get sick of this game very fast. If you are  looking for a huge improvement over SC2K you won't find it here.I have made  this game sound bad but it really isn't. this a very fun and challenging  game and would reccomend it only to one who likes this particular genre."
7,"This a very good tool and cuts very nicely. I agree that it does a nice job cutting. however. I give it 4 stars because the handles are a bit weak looking and flex easily when trying to cut live branches that approach 3 inches. and I am afraid I will snap the handle if I put too much pressure. That happens when the handles are fully extended or not...so 4 stars. With that said. it works as advertised. It can be locked closed. Be careful and it should get the job done relatively easily. I just wish the handles were sturdier."
5,"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it. plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack. Best Buys no where else. I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself. but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way. I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards.ffsalsa"
7,"I just tried my stovetop smoker and was amazed at the results.  I've used a large outdoor smoker for years. and was skeptical about the stovetop smoker.  I used it to prepare chicken breasts. and they cooked fast and were juicy and tender. and had just the right amount of smoke flavor.  I'm looking forward to using my stovetop smoker for seafood and vegetables.  It's a great way to add flavor to food. and a very healthy way to cook.The smoker is constructed from heavy steel and is well made.  I could smell the smoke as the food cooked. but it wasn't intense and there was no smoke in the house.  I'll still use my outdoor smoker for batch cooking or for smoking large birds. but expect to get a lot of use out of the stovetop smoker."
10,"When I got the tool. the fence was not alligned with the blade.  The slots on material would not line up parallel. and did not fit well.  The fence is attached with two screws. and is movable.  Other machines (I also have a Makita) use a design with two machined. parallel surfaces. and this is not a problem.  With the Dewalt. it is.  After aligning the fence. the machine works. but out of the factory. it was not even close."
6,"I hate wrapping gifts. so I really liked how easy the tape made it.  You couldn't see the fingerprints. it has a nice finish to it. and the pieces are precut to a nice short length.  I found this all very helpful.  I read on one of the reviews that there was a complaint about the amount of tape that was on these rolls. and I have to agree that there wasn't as much. but for me that was a minor negative.  I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient."
12,"This is the best racing game i've ever played and the most funest. The game has a cool unique to a racing game. it is tons of fun. and you can play either Mario. Luigi. Peach (The Princess). Toad. Yoshi. Bowser(King Koopa) & Donkey Kong. There are three types of trophies you can recieve. either the Mushroom trophy. Flower Trophy. Star Trophy and A Special Trophy. Cool Hu. Well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone. Peace OutIf you liked this game then check out all of the Mario Games."
10,"I got this kit and it took me 15 minutes to disassemble. install and reassemble my Ridgid saw. Literally. I don't know why others have had such a hard time. The wrenching is tricky and you need a big one. but c'mon now!For my saw this was an EXACT match (the Ridgid branded one was $150! What???)If you are not mechanical or not very strong. you'll need help. but if you are... Just get it!I got another for the Jet saw at my company's shop and it unsurprisingly worked perfectly.Completely recommended."
4,"This is the most accurate and inspiring of the Passion Plays ever done on film.Those who find it alarmingly brutal miss the fact that the Crucifixion of Christ was beyond brutal.Without the suffering of Jesus. the Christian religion is pointless.I cannot watch this film very frequently. but I well remember the first time it was screened in Houston on Ash Wednesday.The Catholics. with ashes on their foreheads. quietly watched. The Evangelicals came to their seats with big boxes of popcorn. which they dropped on the floor as they witnessed the horror of the performance. Christianity is not a saccharinesque religion.. Many people learned this for the first time as they watched The Passion of the Christ."
6,"This is an excellent double sided mounting tape for small items. However. you have to make sure the surface you attach it to is absolutely clean. If there is oil. dirt. grease. etc. it is not going to stick for very long. And the surface you attach it to has to be dry and stay dry and it has to be strong enough to hold whatever you are mounting. If the surface has been waxed. it may not stick for very long. All you have to do is clean the area where you are going to use it and it will do an excellent job. This is a light to medium strength mounting tape and should not be subject to heat or vibration. If you want to mount something in your car or boat. there are other very high strength mounting tapes. If you want to mount a small picture or similar then use 4 good sized pieces. one in each corner. don't use just one in the middle. This mounting tape would be excellent for mounting poster boards."
2,"...the spring rusts. I own both the 12' (for normal indoor cooking) and the 16' (for grilling). I have used both countless times. They grip food well and you feel as though you have a firm hold of the hood too. In all the times I have used them. I have discovered two main flaws. The first flaw is the flexibility (bend-ibility)of the 'hands'. the part of the tongs that actually touches the food. If you grasp the food too tight. they bend. This means the they will not close tight without bending them back into shape. The second is the metal used in the spring. This metal is prone to rust and when it rusts the tongs no longer have their normal spring and often get stuck. My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a hight quality."
11,"This game is a lot of fun. specially when you have too many players for things like dominion. ticket to ride and catan. The game is a little complicated to play at first. as there are several roles and different buildings you need to understand properly to form a strategy. Yet with not too much time you will start understanding the patterns and the dynamics that form each player's strategy.One particular thing that I enjoy in this game is its impression of unbalance (which is fun. as it makes you feel like you are winning). but in the end. it turns out players have nearly the same score. The details are what count. not the majestic buildings."
7,"I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are. was different. They support all the weight of this big bird feeder. and its heavy when filled...its good its a big one. filling less often interests me. BUT...the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this. and I am thinking in time. just from the elements and the sun/heat that with taking this apart to fill. refill. etc the plastic will fatigue...then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels can't even TRY to get into anymore.To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder. On the upside. it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made. it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions."
11,"Some of our friends introduced us to this game. and after playing it one time we knew we would soon be purchasing it. The game is very simple to learn and easy to play - simply matching colors or shapes. While there is some strategy to the game. there is more luck involved than anything else. One thing I especially like about this game is the wood block construction. Extremely durable! This is not an educational game. so if that is one of your primary goals for game purchases. look elsewhere. However. if you're just looking for a new family game that you can play at parties. at the campsite. at church youth functions. or just around the kitchen table. this is the one you're looking for! You will not be disappointed!"
11,"We really like this game for family game night.  My daughter asks to play it over and over.  I also own Dixit: Journey and have folded the two games together. but mostly I like the cards and the components to this game better.  This is a great game for kids that allows them to expand their imagination. and also fun for adults to come up with creative ways to describe cards that kids will understand.  Really fun. and I saw this on Wil Wheaton's Tabletop show and knew we would love it.  Great addition to family game night."
1,"We use these bags in two of our trashcans in the kitchens.  We have a kitchen on the main floor and in the basement and these 13 gallon bags are just the right size for our kitchen trash containers.  By the end of the week they are pretty full and we dump some smaller trash cans into the sacks as there is still room and then they are full to the top.  I have never had one leak or tear on me and I like the tie flaps to close the bag securely and to carry it outside.This is a good product and we will continue to use it and I recommend it to you.  The price here is high compared to what we are paying and you might want to shop around."
2,"Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor. easy to clean filter and good accessory package.  Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors. However. it has 2 problems.  First. the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily.  It has no reinforcing. so you don't want to step on it or bend it around a corner.  Second. the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length.  This gives the hose a little strength. but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds.  I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it.  If it feels weak. I need to take off the hose and shake it clean.  In good clean condition. it works as well as any canister."
8,"My 2 yr old standard schnauzer will chew through anything.  I've been searching for a bully stick that will last more than 20 minutes with her. and still haven't found one.  For some reason though. she plays with this toy differently.  Handles it gingerly and is more interested in playing catch with herself than tugging and tearing.  That said. this is the first non-animal-part toy that has lasted more than 5 minutes.  It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours. which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last.Update: one eye is missing from the bear. but all the seams appear to be intact and she's still very engaged.  Very impressed with the item. although I'm sure it would be torn to shreds if it was her choosing."
2,"I bought this unit in hopes it would fill in a gap in our 'desert self-sufficiency'. that is our ability to make rather than buy whatever we were craving and avoid having to hump into town for supplies.This gem of a unit has the frozen desert category covered.It IS bigger than it looked - but only about the size of standard Cuisinart food processer as far as footprint.  We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.  Note on the bowl:  its possible to make two batches before refreezing. just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise. but for us its not too much.  Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.  Sweet."
12,"As part of the core Team at SONY Computer Entertainment that worked on the development of the Crash series. and helped propel Naughty Dog into the Video Game Industry as a premier Developer. with these million seller Crash games. I'm proud of what we did. and I STILL enjoy the Crash Bandicoot gameplay and graphics. Buy them up folks. I had to buy these because my little girl gave my copies to her little friends back in the '90s. I hadn't given it much thought until now. and realized that I just had to have my own copies again. Yes. I STILL have PlayStation 1. 2. & 3 consoles and WILL buy the second generation PS-4."
1,"Guys if you have a thick beard that is prone ingrown hairs. this product may be your solution. By cleaning and lubricating my Braun shaver with this solution. I have significantly reduced painful razor bumps. While the shave isn't as close as premium blades. the loss of pain is well worth the shortcoming.Two tips: 1) I  recommend cleaning the hair particles out of the shaver manually so as to get the most out of the solution. Occasionally. I will even clean the foil and block with ethyl alcohol before placing the saving2) Prevent evaporation -- consistently leaving the saver in the stand will help preserve the volatile solution more effectively.  If you live in an extremely arid climate and are extremely frugal. covering the whole stand with 2 gallon zip lock bag might help."
4,"This is MUCH improved from her first video. The music is not annoying. she's got good people demonstrating proper positioning. and I really like how she narrates instead of talking while doing the routine. I think more videos should do that! I love her opening prayer and how the moves really put me in a spirit of praising God.This routine just seems too easy. like for senior citizens. It's nice to do on a rest day to keep myself limber and for meditating on the wonder of God.I will look for her new power version looking for something more challenging for the muscles.  Keep it up Laurette! We all learn from trial and error."
4,"BUY IT!!!  I saw Dr. Ben Carson on a news program and was totally impressed by him. That was before I knew his life history.  I was surfing to watch a movie (any movie) and came across &#34;Gifted Hands.&#34;  As I watched it. I found myself saying what an incredible story it is.  This movie will inspire you.  I highly recommend it to all parents of school-aged children.  It's very. very good.  I watched it twice and loaned it to my daughter of three school-aged children.  She agreed that it's the best docudrama she ever saw.  She is inspired and acting on what inspired her.  My husband (not a movie fan) watched it from beginning to end without complaint!  IT'S GOOD!"
10,"This is an excellent sander.  I really work this machine and it just keeps on going.Brace your feet. hang on tight and keep on moving; this is a powerful sander.I usually sand with three grits and when changing belts it is rarely necessary to touch the tracking adjustment.The 4 inch footprint is more resistant to tipping than my 3 inch sander and ergonomics are perfect for me.Cons:  There were 2 flat spots on the metal front roller 180 degrees apart which cause a barely discernible bump but it's not really a problem.  It just sometimes makes it hard to tell if a belt is about to separate or not.Recommended."
6,"Avery always makes great labels and gives you the best templates and software to go with them. so it's no surprise that I'm very pleased with their clear easy-peel address labels. The healthy 1' x 2 5/8' size allows for plenty of font choices.I use tan parchment-colored envelopes for my business and slapping a white label on them gives a second-class mail look.  The clear labels impart a more professional appearance. and while I don't know it to be a fact. I think recipients are far more likely to pay attention.Finally. the easy peel feature prevents both frustration and inappropriate words in the office. Highly recommended."
5,"After trying out a few other styles and brands. I settled on this stand. wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall. The overall design of the stand is great. but I had to return my first stand. as there were severe quality issues with the finish. There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn't stick to the metal. and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out. The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right. once it was clamped down to the main stand body. Disappointingly. the replacement unit I received also has this issue. but only about 7-10 degrees worth. I'm going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish. and truly worthy of my guitar."
6,"I have two different laser printers. each with a special envelope slot that is meant to feed envelopes so that you can print an address directly on each envelope. There are two problems with both. First. you can feed only one envelope at a time (they won't accomodate a stack of envelopes). Secondly. half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem. So. I have given up on running envelopes through my laser printers.The Avery Easy Peal mailing label sheets fit into the standard 8.5' by 11' tray and feed flawlessly through the print track. I can print 300 labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly.The drawback is. you must run a sheet of 30 labels through the printer even if you need only one label. But if you have a lot of mailing to do. this generous quantity of labels helps get the job done quickly and inexpensively."
12,"Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a well-made game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles.  The battles. which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy. are simplified by Z-Targeting. which aims all attacks at the enemy.  It takes a long time to beat (months). as any good RPG (Role-Playing Game) should.  Unfortunately. it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls. although they're pretty easy. in messages which you usually must read.  I suggest this for all people. especially those that enjoy a good challenge."
5,"Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I'd had in high school.  This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness.  I did want collapsible legs. which this has. and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand.  Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory. and has been in constant use for months now.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The height is easily adjustable. and the shelf tilt is easy too.  Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid!"
12,"I'm 23 now. got the game when it first came out when I was around 12. Still the bet snowboarding game of all time. So much fun that I still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game. Has a time attack mode. trick mode. racing series. and a mixture of them all. Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself. Great game...that's highly reccomended."
10,"I purchased this for my Delta Platinum Contractor's Saw with Unifence.  Installation is pretty straight-forward. although I have to modified my Rockler outfeed table a bit to accommodate one of the mounting brackets.  Once installed. the blade guard works very well.  I particularly like the easily-removable splitter -- very handy when I am using my sliding table.  My only gripe is that I wish there is a vacuum port in the blade guard.  The saw dusts seem to be focused to fly directly back at you -- I guess that is a good reminder not to stand directly inline with the blade!"
6,"If you're fed up with half-wits pestering you at home in the evening. this device is a godsend. I had been receiving an average of three calls each evening. which I tried to deal with by turning down the answering machine. But I still heard the 'beep' each time a call was received. Worse yet. some of the callers felt the need to leave a message.The TeleZapper cuts off these calls before they even get to your answering machine. or to you. There are competing products that cost less. but this one is the most effective that I've found."
2,"I love this peeler!  I had one just like it for many years (until I somehow lost it!) and it worked perfectly EVERY time.  I couldn't remember where I bought it and couldn't find another one in any stores - until I finally looked on Amazon.  Thank you. Amazon!  Not only is the gripper handle perfect. the blade works as it should.  I purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and I was very disappointed.  Their blades kept slipping over the vegetables without cutting.  Very frustrating.  I even tried a kitchen Aid brand and hated it.  So save yourself the frustration and the tired hands and just buy this one!"
7,"Bought two after watching neighbor's do fairly well except for watering neglect.This year will have her hang closer to our yard so we can keep eye on it.These two. when set. will be accessible to daily watering as needed.  It doesn't look to be any 'foam ring' in these 2.  BUT one can always stir 'foam packing peanuts' into dirt/potting mixture. which will create some lightness to over all hanging weight. as well as help with water retention.As to Fabric rotting/giving out after one season vs the earlier reviews. Sounds like the typical of past 4 yrs of IMPORTED product where the MFG has reduced the quality of the fabric."
10,"Earlier this year. I found an affordable LED reading lamp I liked at Target. but sadly. it stopped working this week. Hoping for an even better alternative. I checked again at Target. and also at Ikea. Target still offered a variation of the lamp I'd bought before. but for triple the price of this similar LED lamp from Ikea.I particularly like the compact light housing on the Ikea lamp. and the heavy base that ensures the light stays where I aim it. My only complaint is that the power switch is in the power cord rather than a toggle switch on the base as it is on the Target lamps. The light output is also a bit less. but I consider that an advantage for reading in bed.My wife doesn't like the look of the Ikea lamp. but I really do like it. so form your own opinion from the photos.Recommended."
12,"This is the best puzzle game ever made. Although I love the Puyo Puyo style games (Dr. Mario. Columns. Bust A Move. etc.). I have to say that Tetris is the cream of the crop. After all. Tetris is what sold the original Gameboy. and it was logical to make Tetris DX a launch title when the Game Boy Color came out. I bought the GBC the day it was released. and I bought Tetris DX the next week. and Tetris DX is one of the most-played titles on my GBC...the sheer addictiveness of the game is so frickin' awesome. and I love how blocks fall faster in later levels (so it has an 1980's old-school style to it...I love &quot;old school&quot; games)."
5,"I can't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer (FOX).  If you haven't started in the mic-collecting business. trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below. you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one.  I've always wondered why I can't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet. and I finally realize it's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't.It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives (face it. those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use).  It's very directional and 'selective' (rejecting room ambience and background noise). so it's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications.  But for announcing. broadcasting. vocal performance and vocal recording. I don't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it."
7,"With the included attractant I caught one yellowjacket.  They preferred to go to the hummingbird feeder and when I took the feeder down they flew away.  Using apple juice I caught some even with the feeder up and more when I took the feeder down.  They live for several days and most of them eventually escaped at night.  Next year I will put this in the refrigerator each night to chill the yellowjackets. kill them while they are torpid. and then put it back up.  Apple juice worked in the fall but something else might be required in the spring."
4,"I would give this video 10 stars if I could-it is the most wonderful of all the S.S videos I have bought(and I have about 20) The characters are incredibly adorable. and make the process of learning the alphabet fun. not just a task for kids.Unlike a few of the other reviewers who think Baby Bear and his 'lisp' should not have been the focus. are being ridiculous-there are alot of kids out there with speach impediments who talk just like Baby Bear or even worse-I know of 3 in my daughters Pre-k class. Sesame Street shows kids in wheelchairs and kids with Down Syndrome on the show. I guess they should not be on the show either????So. I think he is a welcome addition to the video. Check your attitudes at the remote before playing the video for your kids if you feel that way-it may be annoying to adults-but it is what the kids can relate to and understand that matters."
1,"The G-U-M stimulators do exactly what they should do - get the bad stuff out and away from around your teeth.  Even after brushing long and thoroughly. there is still stuff left under the gum rims. The G-U-M Stimulator tip removes the bad stuff without hurting your gums.The difficult part about the G-U-M stimlators is getting the rubber tips onto the metal handle.  It takes a lot of hand strength.  Moistening the tip with hot water helps. but it still takes a lot of hand strength.  The other downside is that a single stimulator is good for only about 3 or 4 uses - then the tip begins to break.  Time to wrestle a new tip onto the handle."
7,"Purchased this snow removal tool for my wife. who uses her car on a daily basis for work.  While the car trunk is already filled with an assortment of semi-helpful gadgets. assuring her safety on the road. the Sno Brum is unquestionably in the top 5.  The tool is simple. effective. and does &#8220;what it says it does&#8221; easily. The tool doesn&#8217;t scratch the car body. is lightweight. and yet durable.  Don&#8217;t hit the snowy roads this winter without it!  All the more in Connecticut. a state in which a regulation will go into effect whereby cars may be fined up to $1000 for excess snow and ice flying off."
5,"This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.  The strings last a long time. in my opinion.  They keep their bright look and sound. even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.I have always liked D'Addario's packaging.  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge. D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green. the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory). the high E is silver. and so on. I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly. It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great. but the first few times. it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.D'Addario is my favorite string. hands down. after almost 40 years of playing."

12,"THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy. difficult to totally master. and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original. and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good. better than the &quot;save the princess&quot; generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time. an eternally youthful forest girl. a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain. a rebellious fish woman. a determined royal guard. a sexy thief. the &quot;princess&quot;. and of coure. Ganon the bad guy."
4,"One of my child hood favorite G-films released on a DVD of incredible quality. This DVD has even more special features than 'Mothra vs. Godzilla'. with an image gallery included. This time David Kalat was the `G-expert' selected for the commentary. I think he delivers an entertaining performance as he mainly focuses on the evolution of Godzilla from a serious villain to a campy and comical hero. He tells us his opinion on the matter and how it really affected the original series. The image gallery has some nice photos with captions and in the end another great classic media release."
8,"This may be the best of all the Mutipet toys! Previously gave great reviews of others. but this one never stops! They bite it.  step on it. sit on it and hide it from each other. It always gives itself away tho with its 'OOOOONNNOOOOOO!!!!' I keep 2 around here and have given several to friends. I think it's particularly popular with those of us who remember Mr Bill. but it sure translates to the dogs!While these are really durable for us I don't think real chewers will take long to dismantle this. My guys are over 80lbs bot don't chew or pull things apart."
10,"I bought this saw 22 years ago and have used it since. I am a professional electrician and use a circular saw from time to time on the job for wood braces and supports. The saw has never been serviced or repaired. Some 7 years ago. I bought a Freud carbide blade from Home Depot. That's all I've done to it. and it keeps on going and going.  When it no longer works. I'll get another. But. at the rate that it last and last. who knows when that will be."
2,"Cuisinart. I thought. built quality products. Then they started manufacturing this mess that they call a blender. What a stretch to call it a blender! It needs help to puree the ingredients for a smoothie (you must frequently STIR the ingredients yourself.) The blade assembly eventually cracked. There is now a black residue around the black whirly thing on the base. My husband thinks that it over heated. All that damage from making SMOOTHIES?! Yep. Cuisinart take note-I AM NOT BUYING CUISINART PRODUCTS AGAIN. I would venture to guess others feel the same. I'm happy that some folks had a good experience with this 'blender' but I am not one of them."
1,"There are so many water bottles out there today that it's easy to end up with a collection of 10 or 20 before you realize you have nothing to use to clean the very bottom of the bottle.This brush does a great job reaching those tiny corners way down in the bottom of the bottle.  The bristles are flexible enough to be pushed into even small bottle necks so it will work for pretty much any water bottle out there today.  You can be brave enough to drink tea or juice out of your water bottles once you invest in this!"
6,"I'm a big fan of printing my own return address labels and these are the best ones so far.I went to the Avery website for the free templates and using Microsoft Word.I printed the best labels I've ever printed & it was faster and more accurate than it's ever been.The labels themselves are are the best I've seen so far.you just bend the sheet at the column and the edge of the label pops up so you can peel it off.so much easier than in the past.The reason these are my favorite labels is because they are 1/2 an inch tall and 1 3/4 inch long and are perfect for putting on printed return forms instead of trying to fit my clumsy handwriting in the tiny writing space.I really like these...They're Great!"
11,"Not very easy for my little kids to use but it works. They get confused on the up or down arrow. Not sure on the settings until after a minute. then the clock shows the minute/time. They like to see the seconds too but this doesn't  have the seconds. I keep one in the van so when we are on the road I can keep track of their reading. The library gives them awards/prizes for minutes read in the summer. They will read for prizes and this is a good way for me to keep track."
6,"We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens. with the white barrel. medium or fine points.  I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design.  It says white barrel in the description. but I hoped to get this new color.  Luckily I did.  The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside. and it looks more interesting than the traditional white.  But. I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it.  It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always. too.  Not as good as the Cristal pens. but decent.  The Cristal pens have a wider point or something. even though these are both labeled as medium points.  If you want a basic blue ballpoint. this is it."
4,"Maybe this is all part of THE JOKE; to get people caught up in the reemergence of Kaufman fame and then to purchase a totally CRUMMY product. HAHAHAHA! I bet Bob Zmuda (Andy's best friend) was a behind this. HAHAHAHA!  Just reading the reviews got me to laugh. Part of Andy's act was bombing on  purpose. Go back and watch this again or compare the part in the movie when  Kaufman wanted the ABC special to look as if it was messing up. (MAN are  some people gullible...)"
11,"Great instructional book and human body model.  It is smaller than I thought.  Other reviews warn that the parts of the body will get scattered about the house if you let young child play unsupervised.  Well. my science savvy 4 year old grandson and 6 year old granddaughter started out exploring the parts and were able to put the body back together themselves.  However. after a while. they created some other games and now. about half the parts are unaccounted for--I think their dog ate some.  So parents. this is great for older children. it is a great tool to learn about the body. and great for younger ones with supervision.  Has anyone seen a spleen?"
5,"I've been using one of these Kyser's for a good while now. I only have one so it usually stays with the mandolin but works just as well for my banjo. If you never used one. it's makes it MUCH easier to change keys although I usually only use it when I'm playing chords. when I solo I like to play with open strings and this makes it a breeze to pop off and put back on. With a little practice you'll be able to do it quickly without having the strings buzz."
8,"I gave this to my mother for Christmas. She has an old cat who loves to play in water and she had always talked about some day getting him a pet water fountain. I had read a few other reviews and was a little leery as to how well this would work. but gave it a try.Her cat loves it! From day 1 there have been no problems with it. And best of all. it VERY quiet. You can't hear it at all! She has it set up in her living room. I didn't even know it was there.I would just make sure you always have it filled with water so the pump doesn't burn out on you. Because cats drink so much water with this. when you first get it. you should watch the water levels so that you get an idea on how often you should replenish the water supply.Absolutely great product!"
2,"I love this fan. We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it. It's pretty simple to figure out. It has three settings: High. medium. low. This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air. It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high (which is kind of expected).Overall. this is a purchase I have not regretted. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan. You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store. I got mine at Dollar General."
12,"Once again. Crash Bandicoot takes a big step up to greatness! 'Crash Bandicoot 3: WARPED' was fantastic! It was even better than the second one. Better graphics. story. music. and gameplay.The enemies were fun just like in the first one and the new vehicles available were awesome. like the bi-planes. space fighter. Pura the Tiger. and the jet-ski. Also. it wasn't as difficult to gather the Crystals and Gems as it was in the second part. The environments were better and the new powers that Crash Bandicoot acquires are totally awesome: the Super Belly-Flop. Speed Shoes. Death-Tornado Spin Attack. and the totally awesome Fruit Bazooka! This is definitely one of the best of the games in the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy. You Crash fans MUST get this game!"
7,"I cooked a Turkey on my Charcoal Rotisserie for Thanksgiving 2010. I used the Pecan Wood Chips according to the instructions on the bag. and WOW!!! They put a taste into that Turkey that is hard to describe!!  It was so delicious and jucy. I always wondered what Pecan Wood smoke would do to meat. and now I know. No turning back now. I must try some Ribs with these chips next. and a Roasting Chicken.....mmmmmmmmm!!  Highly recommended. Will purchase again."
12,"my uncle gave this to me for christmas. i didnt know what it was until i got a gamecube and bought resident evil 4. then i knew what this game was. i wasnt crazy about it when i first got it. then i got resident evil 2 and tried the uncut version.it was ok. i started playing it now and then. a month later. i found the orginal resident evil and i compared them. And the uncut was a little better because you can use the analog sticks.and instead of gettin only 2 ink ribbons. you get 4 every time u pick them up. the bad part is that the graphics haven't improved. it is also very scary. like the big snake boss which scared the hell out of me. Still i think you should own both of these but if you want only one of these. go with the uncut one."
10,"I bought this saw and have used it a lot in refurbishing an old house.  It is a powerful and excellent saw and it cuts exceptionally true even through very thick stock.  The only problem some people might have with it is that it is quite large and heavy.  I have large hands so this is not a serious problem but thank God I did not buy the even larger Bosch model which is REALLY huge!  Also. changing blades is a pain if you do not do it all the time since the procedure is overly complicated.  No wonder they put it on the barrel of the saw!"
12,"Golden Eye on the Nintendo 64 needs no introduction it redefined the FPS genere it had great controlls for it's day stuck as close as it could with the movie it was a major killer app for the 64 around  97-98. The music was good the graphics were decent enough there dated now but this game was & still is the $**t. Golden Eye never has failed on any level I still play it from time to time & the multiplayer back in the summer of 98 me my friends or my brother or his friends or my cousin we all played the multiplayer to death. Should you get this game well it's been out since the late 90's & & if you never played it your missing out it warrants a purchase of a N 64 for this game alone. Golden Eye for the 64 is as good if not better than movie."

8,"In all honesty. I'd rather not use this type of chemical product on my dogs.  I resisted for as long as I could but the so-called natural products were. sadly. ineffective.  I was pulling off a tick a day from them and I found a few of the little suckers crawling on me.  That was the last straw. so enter Frontline.  Bottom line. it works better than anything else I've tried. There's nothing more to say about it. except if someone knows about an effective natural/less chemically product. please let me know."
11,"My daughter and two granddaughters received this for Christmas.  There ages are 10. 6. and 4.  The little ones need some help from their mom but it was a great experience anyway.  My 10 year old is hiding the book until she gets it published; to surprise us with her life story..  The kids of all ages really enjoyed it.  High quality. will purchase it again.  Can't comment on the publishing stage as we are still in the &#34;writing the book&#34; phase."
12,"I could go on and on. but look. it is really very simple. It's hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly.

1,"I bought these batteries thinking they where rechargable. but they aren't!These batteries lasted a very long time. I would say about 4-6x longer than my rechargeable batteries. in my ebook reader.Pro's:Long enduranceHigh power outputExcellent for both high power devices (like digital camera's or flash) as low power devices (clock or ebook reader).Cons:Non-rechargableDon't last as long as they mention on the package (4-6x not 8x longer than rechargeables. and about 2x longer than Duracell batteries)Conclusion:I would never buy these batteries for the sole reason that they are non rechargable.Otherwise they are excellent for small electronic devices like clocks and small portable radio's and ebook readers.For high power devices. though these batteries are excellent. I would especially recommend to get rechargeables!"
2,"I had a great little OXO brush with a suction cup that stuck to the side of the sink that finally needed replacing.  Sadly they don't seem to make that kind anymore.  So I replaced that with a longer handled brush and liked the price ($4.50 as an add on item) and the reviews.I wasn't sold on it the first use. but then I started getting more comfortable with the different style. and I like it.I would have liked the bristles a little closer together. but I figure I'll buy another round dish brush if need be.  It's great for glasses and even for scrubbing pans.  There is a soft plastic scraper tip for caked on stuff.I hand wash 75% of my dishes. so I use dish brushes a lot.  This is a good value dish brush and I am quite happy with it.  It's not worth paying $10 - $15 for a perfect brush when this is really good for a lot less."
12,"I played Croc 2 more often. but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young.  These games were so fun. as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them).  The controls are a bit stiff. but this did release in 1997. so that should be expected.  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple. but the game is fun nonetheless. and for me it's a pretty timeless classic. that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.  Definitely worth the money."
4,"I have been waiting for this for what seems like ever. and I have not been disapointed.  This was one of the few films that I have watched through the whole of my life and never been tired of.  Whether it was the English or Japanese version I loved it.  Everything about it was awesome and even if the DVD didn't have special features I would have purchased it the moment it touched the shelf.If you are a fan of science fiction. kaiju. or just monsters in general then do yourself a favor and pick this film up turn the lights down low (where applicable) and get ready to be amazed by the cheezy monstery goodness that came to you from a long long time ago from a far away land across the sea.A simple plot with enough mystery to keep you plugged in and enough human drama to make you car abou the characters and enough monsters  and sci fi to keep you happy.  Just watch it and see for yourself."
8,"My dog's all-time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt! ball.  She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her.  After a while though. it gets slippery. so when I saw this Launcher I wasn't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try.  Well. it does work!  It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball. and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand.  Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog.  Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog's mouth.  This comes in several sizes.  Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat. or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it."
10,"These may cost a bit more but they last and save time not to mention money.  Use them to remove material that has not been coated with any type of VOC poly or paint and they will outlast other types of belts.  They are too good to use in a situation where heat and goo will clog the grit .  Better to use a cheap belt first then go to these for efficient quality removal.  Clean the belt often with a belt cleaner especially if you think it is getting so hot that it is melting the finish instead of abrading it."
2,"A pizza cutter isn't something you think about all that often until you need one. Well. I did. Not only does Pizza Hut never cut my pizzas all the way through. but frozen ones don't come with any slice cuts at all. So you gotta have one of these. My old one must have been about as sharp as a spoon because it took many. many rolls across the pizza surface to make a cut. Missed a lot and created too many super narrow slices. This little guy does it perfectly in one pass. so I'm a fool for having waited so long to buy one."
12,"It's true that Pokemon is pretty much a passing craze due to (for some odd reason) the invention of TOO MANY POKEMON! However. this game is amazing. The graphics. attack animations. and sounds are very simple compared to later installments of the series. but who cares? At the time. this was like nothing anyone had ever played! The music is extremely catchy. and there are so many things to collect. you'll just find yourself playing for hours. Also. you can trade Pokemon from other people since the Red and Blue versions have Pokemon exclusive to that version. Also. if you feel the need to 'catch 'em all.' trade starters. or evolve certain Pokemon with a trade. The bottom line: it's a great guilty pleasure and introduced what is now the most faded franchise ever!"
11,"The negative reviews this game has been getting for not being compatible with expansions are not deserved. This game is great and the best co-op board game available 2nd toDays of Wonder Shadows Over Camelot. This game is a remake by Fantasy Flight and is an improvement on the original. If you have to have the old expansions then sure buy the original game but this new verion stands on its own (I think Fantasy Flight might be working on revised expanions anyway). The artwork and design is beautiful! You really need to strategize. especially before heading into Mordor or you will lose! Non-gamers and gamers alike will both love this game! Makes a great companion toThe Hobbit Boardgame. Same artist and game designer on both."
4,"I held off watching this movie because I had heard so much about the blood and gore. But I knew that I would eventually see it. I embrace the story of Christ and the power of his teachings. Though this film contains only a few scenes of his life and ministry. the depiction of torture and the crucifixion aptly conveys a message of love - that is. what Christ was willing to suffer for all mankind. The imagery of the devil was well-placed. And. to me at least. the story moved at a good pace - not too fast. not too slow. Moreover. James Caviezel's performance was outstanding. However. I was not moved emotionally (or. spiritually) the way I had anticipated. Perhaps it was the hype. But I'm glad that it got so much (well-deserved) attention."
12,"Super Mario 64 is one of the most amazing games I've ever played. In fact. it's my second favorite game of all time. next to Super Mario Galaxy. You get to explore the large levels freely. and do most of the levels in any order you want. Gameplay and controls are simple and easy to pick up.  but they're very fun. Not only do the good graphics look 3D. but the music also sounds 3D. Some things in this game are just too great for words. it's easily the game of the decade for the 90's. easily beating out Super Mario World (The second best). which is amazing. This game is far supirior to that overrated Zelda Ocarina of Time. I rate this game 100/100. It's Perfect!"
1,"Braun's cleaning system is efficient and effective and saves you from manually cleaning your shaver every day. You just have to decide if it's worth paying about $5 per month to have your shaver cleaned automatically for you. For me. it is. I take a tiny bit of pleasure every day in clicking the 'on' button after shaving and walking away. knowing the shaver will be clean and ready to go when I need it. When I travel. I don't bring the cleaning unit. so I use a brush to manually clean the shaver every day. which (a) takes a few minutes. and (b) isn't as effective as the cleaning unit. So it's four stars. withholding one star just for the price."
7,"They are soooo much easier and not near as scary as the old ones.  I don't have to worry about losing my fingers.  I put peanut butter way in the back on the rod instead of where they say to put it. and I catch them every time.I do catch some mice that are small enough to not be harmed. but at least I get them.  And eventually they are not so lucky.  It's so easy to bait and so easy to catch them. Even my kid can do it without harm to her."
10,"I recently picked this up for $79 on clearance at The Borg and am thrilled with it.  I already have a large heavy duty belt sander. but I rarely use the monster because it is so aggressive and heavy.  However. there are times when a random orbit sander is just too slow for the job at hand.  With this little Makita I have excellent control and reasonably aggressive removal rates.  Mine was Made in England. though I'm not sure if they all are.  The belt tracking is automatic.  Just slip the belt on and go.  The balance is just right.  A very nicely engineered tool which I'm glad to have in the collection."
5,"I don't know if this is a common problem. but i have these on both of my basses. and one of the arms that attaches to the actual body of the instrument is starting to show some sort of blemishing. like metal does before it rusts. it is literally only one of the arms out of 4 i have so i think it was just a random thing. The problem is that it makes it so my strap doesn't just spin free in it so the screw keeps getting loose. and one time (the first time) i didn't notice and it actually fell out. Notice i still like the product. this was just one of those things i think. so I would still recommend it."
11,"With a fast pace and ever-changing rules and goals. this is a great game. especially if you might be pressed for time (my wife and I finished a game in about 5 minutes. which. of course. all depends on the shuffling of the deck). Pulling sci-fi elements from multiple sources (Star Trek. Star Wars. 2001: A Space Odyssey. and Firefly. to name a few). you. too. can enjoy trying to put together a crew of spacemen or discover an city of robots. Well worth the minimal cost of the deck. this game has me interested in getting some of the other themes in the Fluxx line."
5,"For a good. basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings. it's difficult to go wrong with D'Addario's EXL110s.  The range of thicknesses generally works well. and D'Addarios tend to be pretty consistent.  Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s (e.g. coating. super brightness. and so on). and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string (e.g. sets that start with 9s or 11s). but for most purposes these work great. hold their tuning well. and seem to last pretty well. too."
2,"I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years. After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one. It does not fit properly in my kitchen window. but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window. The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much. I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised. The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air. The fact that is reversible is very useful. Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house."
2,"There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker.  It...Cannot keep the handle tight. I have to tighten it down about every other use.Cannot form a steam tight seal. steam leaks out around the handles. making them hot to touch. and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off...it doesn't.Cannot keep the broth (fluid) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level.Has no opposing handle; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down.In a word. we got what we paid for...the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market."
10,"I have owned and have regularly used this saw for over three years. As others have pointed out it is almost impossible to get 100 percent accurate cuts from this saw. Tightening the lock down knob does push the blade out of alignment. The only thing you can do to improve this is to not over tighten the knob. but keeping the blade from shifting is still problematic. There is also some play in the blade which allows it to deflect slightly from the work piece. no matter how expensive or stiff a blade you use (worse when cutting hardwoods). But I've discovered that miter saws by their nature aren't accurate enough for fine work. To get extremely accurate crosscuts you need to use an accurately tuned table saw."
11,"I can't say enough about this book and doll. I had days of fun moving it around the house for my grand children's benefit. They enjoyed looking for the next place he was hidden. The story was read over and over by request. and it kept them on their best behavior knowing Santa's elf was watching their every move. I ended up buying it from Barne's and Noble. because after ordering from Amazon backed seller and being told I'd receive it before Christmas. I received an email telling me I would get it until January 15th. Obviously too late for the holiday season. Amazon refunded my money without any issues."
6,"I love these clear labels- Avery is always top-notch. Printing on them is easy- Avery's site provides four ways that you can design and print the labels. I used the 'Avery Design and Print Online'- no downloads required. You can also download the templates to use in Word or on other programs. Anyway. Avery online has lots of designs and it's simple to use. so all I had to do was type in my address and print the labels. They dry right away and the print did not smear at all. Highly recommended product!"
2,"Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.  A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.  Never thought I'd own one (grew up with one -- home cooking). so thought I'd try it myself.So you know. bought one at Walmart (has the Wearever brand)-- $40.00. and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon's 30 day return policy (make sure you read that before buying anything here...surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days. even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences.)"
7,"I am very happy with this deck box. It is very roomy. I keep all my garden supplies there. It was very easy to install. just 5 min. snap all the parts and it is ready to use. It is sturdy too. We sit on it and it holds me. my husband and my 3 years old with no problems. I actually store there some vegetables and fruits. like potato and apples. when I do not have room in refrigerator and I know that animals won't get it. It nicely blends with my white walls of the house."
4,"In a world where most movies have a Hollywood twist and pervert the truth of the scripture. Mel Gibson has does a wonderful job showing the pain that Jesus Christ went through for all of us. James Caviezel does an excellent job playing Christ and showing the human side and physical pain! The location of the film (where it was shot) is absolutely realistic. the characters of the film are realistic and it felt as if I was there. Without the Spirit of God. you won't enjoy the film ... you'll call it a horror film. but this film so much more. Even if you don't believe that Jesus Christ was the Christ. it is still a powerful movie ... and the question that comes to mind is how another human torture another human can like that? It is just unbelievable that we can be that cruel!"
11,"This is a great game. it has a lot of depth.  There are multiple ways to play the game to win.  You can focus your efforts in one area or diversify to gain honor in your village in several areas.  This game has tons of replay value.  I have been playing it with my 9 and 10 year old kids despite the 12 and up tag.  It is simple enough that they were easily able to play it. and complex enough that it is fun to play again and again.  5 stars. this is a great game!"
12,"This games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun. Tenchu had competant graphics for the time. though ugly by 2012 standards. The controls definately had issues but lets face it. this is the best Tenchu game to date. Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments. Years later. the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certain games you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back. This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread. The first one is the best in the series. in my opinion. Priority was never graphics or packaging. It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack."
11,"I bought this for a 7 year old and there is no way a child that small could use it.  Even an older girl -10-11 would struggle a little.  The materials and concepts are adorable. It really does have neat ideas but its just too much for a young girl to do without her mother. which is why I buy these things. because the like to do crafts on their own.  I think a 13-14 year old girl would be fine but not sure if an older girl would be interested in doing this. I'd also say if &#34;Mom&#34; is interested in helping. it would be a lot of fun. But Mom has to do the work. the kids just get to create."
1,"I bought these for my friend. who needed refills for his Braun shaver system...I told him that he'd be better off getting them through me because I can get it in 2 days with my Prime Membership--and they'd be cheaper than the drugstore prices.I was right about the drugstore price comparison.However--when they didn't show up in 2 days. I called Amazon.  It turns out that the shippers require that these be sent regular-speed (something about Hazardous Materials). so it took 10 days to get here.  You cannot order these with the 2 day shipping.As far as the quality--they are the refills that are designed for the unit. and work just perfectly as expected.The Braun Shaver Systems rule :)  According to my friend. at least ;)"
12,"I only gave this game 2 stars because if you're die-hard South Park fan. it's possible that you might enjoy this game... but I like South Park. and I HATED it. The controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use (you have to use the C buttons most of the time). the gameplay is repetitive and boring (all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys). and the multiplayer part is boring too. One pro is that the guns are pretty original &amp; the South Park kids say some funny things. but the novelty wears off after a while. I bought this game when it first came out. for .... and I sold it for $5 at a stoop sale... I just wanted to get rid of it. it's really that bad. If you really have to get it. at least rent it first."
11,"I've found School Zone workbooks to be useful in introducing various subjects. and to review what my child already knows.After completingTransition Math K-1. my son breezed through this workbook. Most of the pages contain counting exercises for numbers 0-12 (they had a great way of explaining zero to little kids!). and shape/pattern recognition. The intro to addition and subtraction used pictures to describe the concept.There was one page about clocks. and a few pages about sequencing and greater/less. At the end of the workbook is a review section of everything that was taught. along with an answer key. and a cute certificate.The School Zone workbook we are currently using isTime. Money and Fractions."
6,"I coveted this trash can. which my sister owned for years. until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly. and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern. as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag. which means every time I empty it. I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot. so if I wait until it's full. it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy. sturdy waste basket!"
9,"I got this because it was cheap and because our pans have all warped over time.  This pan is made of very heavy durable metal.  I don't think it will ever warp considering it weights near 10 pounds.  Anyways. this is a fantastic grill.  Just made an egg on it and it cooked in like 4 minutes.  With our warped pans. it took like 15 minutes after fidgeting the pan around on the stove level to make it level with the grill.  In other words. this pan is excellent and should never warp on you.  It fits our stove perfectly and I am glad I found one this cheap."
7,"I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk/branches of a dessert bush; NOT!!!!!It was worth a try. but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush. I am back to the pick and spade.I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this.I'll give it to my brother.  :>)Note: My rating is strictly for the said application."
10,"Maybe I shouldn't complain; I got this product on sale. However. everytime I cut a dado I have significant tear out on the back side of the cut and the bottom is ANYTHING but smooth - so I smooth it with a float. Also. the plastic holder broke. but I suppose that is just the way plastic containers are. As the other reviewers mentioned. hang on to your instructions - they are just a small piece of cardboard. If I had it to do all over again. I would read the other product reviews and invest in a higher priced dado set and hope that the bottom of the cut is close to being smooth. There are a lot of folks that like this product. so maybe I just got a lemon."
6,"Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is pretty much everything you want from a gift wrapping tape.  It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled. even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure. which I find to be a good thing.  Half the presents that most people wrap are going to kids anyhow. the easy break tape allows them to get into the present without much struggle.  But of course it is still strong enough to go through your general present jossling."
1,"I've used Mederma in the past and it worked really well. Well. I've had to purchase it again because of my lovely doggie Isabella. I have so many scratches because of her jumping and playing. I've been using it for a little over a month.and again it's working. This is good stuff. I saw improvement in a week. Of course I would purchase this again.if fact I'll be doing that real soon. I would recommend this to a friend. I think Mederma deserves more than five stars."
4,"Wow! David has done an excellent job of research and using original documents of the Founding Fathers and religious educators to back up his positions. I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement 'Separation of Church and State' I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers. We have been asleep at the wheel way to long. and I want to thank David again for waking me up. I will no longer give into the ant-religious zealots who want to remove religion from the public arena of this country.May God Bless our Great Nation"
11,"Okay. my title might be a bit confusing.  I will get back to that.  My neice and nephews came over on New Year's Day and I brought this out after everyone finished eating and carrying on.  They all loved it. but it would probably be better to bring out in the beginning of a party or get-together so you don't necessarily think it's someone trying to get you to do something solely for the game.  For instance. if you are trying to get a person to say 'no' to getting you a drink.  You ask them without having them realize that it is the game that you are playing.  Thus. if you are carrying on and talking. one might think you really do want them to get it for you.  I hope I made that clear enough.  So just 'play' it while you are chatting and not an intense 'game'.  They all loved it though."
12,"What what game I'm describing.  It's old. it's puzzling. and it's a blockbuster game.  It's. you guessed it. Myst.  And that is probably the easiest puzzle you'll get concerning Myst. too.  Since it is a popular game  that was released a quite a long time ago. you've probably heard of it by  now.  I'll just say this one thing:  If you're deaf or impatient. AVOID.  There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones...heck. even if you're  NOT deaf. it's still quite a puzzler!  But don't fret...you can beat this  game in FIVE MINUTES if you know how. and it can be found in the many game  walk-throughs of the Internet.  After all. with the difficulty of THESE  puzzles. rest assured. you'll be looking for one!"
10,"This is the third finishing sander I've owned (I got it free when I bought my compound miter saw) and of the three its the best in terms of sanding quality and noise.  However. I'd go with a random orbit sander to get better quality.My biggest complaint is that the dust attachment (DW4111) comes separately (and is not carried by very many suppliers. including Amazon).  The dust bag that comes with their random orbit sander pulls apart and fits a standard 2 1/2 inch dust hose.  Why couldn't they do that with this one?"
6,"This replaced a smaller. somewhat flimsier paper cutter and while that one was merely adequate. I feel this one is ideal for home use.  It will accurately and neatly cut up to 10 sheets of standard paper or approximately 5 pieces of medium card stock at a time.  While this may fall short in an office setting. for our needs at home. it does a great job.Although it's considerably lighter. smaller and easier to store. it shares several important features with its more expensive commercial cousins.  It has an alignment grid and a ruler to ensure that your cuts are accurate and it boasts important safety features such as a guard rail and a blade lock to prevent you from cutting something you don't intend to.  And that's a good thing too because the die-cast metal blade is very sharp to begin with and is self-sharpening as well.The Swingline ClassicCut Lite Guillotine Trimmer is a well-made product that fulfills its promise."
6,"Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes. and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer). and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back. which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them. or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer. at least. isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll"
11,"After reading the reviews of others. I still purchased this toy as well as the one to make silly faces of the same make - I also purchased a couple of small magnetic boards (after reading that the actual sheets to put the magnets on are not magnetic) and clip the sheets onto the magnetic board before having my grandson put the magnetic pieces in place - this works out quite well!  But. yes. I agree the sheets should be magnetic that's why I did not give this toy 5 stars!  These toys are great for stimulating imaginative play as well as learning face/body parts!"
12,"Luckily. I got my expansion pack with Donkey Kong 64.so I didn't have to spend 30 bucks for it. There is a significant difference with the 4 megabytes of extra video memory. but it's nothing revolutionary. However. because quality games like Donkey Kong and Perfect Dark require it. it must be purchased. There are also several games that don't require the expansion pack. but benefit from its use (Top Gear Overdrive. Rouge Squadron). The bottom line: if you're a 64 owner/player. you should probably buy the expansion pack."
6,"The paper quality is good. and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site.  The templates range from wedding invitations to get well cards. to office-oriented announcement cards.  You have to provide the actual text; but the background images are part of the templates. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time.  Helpful instructions are close by.  The templates on the web site are for all versions of Microsoft Word; I had no trouble opening them with OpenOffice.org software."
10,"I bought this about a year ago. still having great results.  I use it all the time.  $10 delivered for a great torche.  It is a bit of a battery hog. but it places out some serious directional light that you can adjust.  What I like about it is the fact that it does not go from working to NOT working. when you are up in an attic or crawl space.  It will slowly start to dim so you know it is time to swap out the battery for a fresh one.  Always check to make sure it is compatible with your rechargeable batteries.  How they can free ship a quality Work Light like this for $10 is beyond me. but I am happy with the purchase one year down the road."
11,"I love the game (x-wing) and this mini is almost a must have for imperial players or starwars collectors. If you have played the game then you know the imperial player have it a little easier when it comes to points so I would suggest buying at least 3 to have a small squad. If you wanted to (and I suggest that you do) buy more than 3. When you start buying these minis you can't just stop at one. these are great fighters and are very VERY FAST. They can more a 5 straight and it is considered green for them plus they introduce the boost ability. I strongly recommend all of the minis for all players.Being these are made from plastic they feel very easy to break and they are. As with all miniatures be very careful when handling. Sometimes simply knocking them to the floor can cause them to break or snap depending on the floor. Just be mindful when handling these things and I would recommend not letting anyone under 10 playing with them."
9,"This Spalding Tack Basketball is very tacky. It makes it easy to palm the ball and provides a light soft touch. Using the ball mainly on indoor courts. it holds up well. I'm doutbful that the texture could withstand a lot of use on an outdoor court. but after a few uses outside. it is still in perfect condition.I like this ball a lot. but I only gave it 4 stars. because I noticed that whenever we pick the 'game ball' for our pickup games. everyone shies away from these balls."
7,"This is the second 4 foot hydrofarm grow light ive purchased.  I bought one last year and then again one this year. (The first one still works great)  I use the grow light for my seed starter kits and noticed that the seedlings directly under the light grow alot stronger and healthier than the ones on the outside edges.  So thats where the 2nd light purchase came in.Having the lights hang from the adjustable strings is a pretty nice feature.  As the plants grow you can raise the light up by the pull of a string.The only thing i would change about this light that would make it better would be if it had 2 bulbs so it covers more area."
4,"Honestly to say the least i thought this movie was going to be an ok movie. something to watch when it comes out on dvd or cable. but my cousins had invited me to the movies. who were going to pay for me so i went. this movie was so emotional. anyone who doesnt feel any emotion to this movie. is absolutely heartless. i recommend seeing. but not constantly. maybe once in a long while. its not a movie to keep watching over and over but a good movie to own. I without a doubt give this movie 5 stars. Great job Mr. Gibson on a directorial accomplishment."
2,"We got rid of the automatic can opener because we wanted one that could easily be cleaned after each use.  We do not put the Oxo Good Grips into the dishwasher. but we do rinse it after each use.  After a few years use. even tho the blade itself has no rust. the recessed screw area and portions of the handle has rusted badly.  You'd think that it would not be that costly to use stainless screws. washer. and nuts. and it would certainly improve the quality greatly.  It works easily and smoothly enough. even though it is a little bulky for smaller hands and in the drawer.  We thought that by purchasing one of the more expensive brands. it would not rust. so that part is disappointing."
1,"I was very disappointed that the local grocery store and CVS both stopped carrying this tape at the same time. Are they discontinuing it? It was always more expensive than the other brands (store brand. NextCare). but you got what you paid for. I bought 3 rolls to hopefully last me a while.Unlike competing brands. the Johnson and Johnson cloth tape is:1. Easy to cut2. Easy to write on with sharpie. will not bleed and will not fade3. Very sticky4. Does not leave adhesive residue after being pulled off5. Relatively waterproof"
10,"This is a great book for anyone interested in getting their feet wet with Pocket Joints. I bought a Kreg Master Kit and built the bookcase in this book as my first project.  It came out beautiful without a hitch. Did my own variation for the trim but otherwise followed the plans exactly. I am planning on moving on to a chest of drawers as my next project and have no doubt that it can be done with the basic kit I have. There is one caveat. you will need some extra clamps to make working with the pocket joints a lot simpler. They are like having extra hands a crucial points in the assembly process. I read the material over and over so it is in my head when I go to work in the shop."
9,"I am by no means an expert knife sharpener. Although I am happy to say I have some very nice knives. I've always felt a little stupid for not having the skill nor the equipment to properly sharpen my knives. I bought this stone and I have to say that it allows even a novice to do a fine job.In fact. I have nothing but good things to say about this stone set. I am SURE than an expert knife sharpener would have a different frame of reference but it allows me to put a razor-sharp edge on 154CM. 440. S30V and M390 blades that I own. I'm very happy with my purchase."
4,"As most movies. this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out. it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph. his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)."
12,"I recieved this game for one of my birthday's many years ago. At first I was excited...but when I played it...oh boy. The Graphics were horrible. too rough and generic. To make matters worse. they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.The missions were dull. Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse. you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping. so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun. but it gets dull fast. Basicly. it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points. other than that. this is probably the worst game I have ever played. Don't buy this game...rent it at most..or borrow it."
7,"A decent quality product that appears to be more or less accurate however. I'm not thrilled with the fairly ambiguous rating system for the test results:  I conducted all four tests on a veggie garden soil sample.  The pH test was great - clear results.  The N. K and P test parameters are pretty loose. though.  Essentially. you can tell whether your soil is deficient but it's pretty difficult to discern the difference between the &#34;adequate&#34; reading and the reading indicating an overabundance of the given substance.  I posted a customer pic on the vendor's listing to illustrate results.  Who knows if they will post it.  I don't think I would re-purchase this item."
12,"I've played this game when I first got the Playstation around the year of 1997. First Mature rated game and after all of these years I return back to the dungeon to claim victory. Luckily. I did. Deathtrap Dungeon is not for the gamer who is use to FPS. Fighters or 3D Games that runs on the Quake Engine. This game is for collector's of games when they were in the early stages of become Platinum Hits in the world of gaming as of today. The game works fine but. keep in mind that when you order this game get ready for a journey and one heck of a challenge. Its not hard but. this is a game that you really need patience with."
1,"This bottle brush is well made and GREAT for most things. but it has a THICK stem that will NOT go into regular size water bottles. so don't buy it for that! I tried to use it on the VOSS water bottle I use (recycle.) and for spice bottles. and my sport jug - it was hopeless. You need a regular old fashioned 'baby bottle' brush with the thin wire stem for regular drinking bottles. OR TRY this incredible brush:Way Clean 33030 Bottle Brushwhich is under four dollars AND has a thinner shaft to fit more bottles. glasses. etc. and which is SLANTED to facilitate a thorough cleaning!"
2,"Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff... NO Problem and the adjustable part of this holder is that the two parts that actually hold the book swivel so you can move them in or out to accommodate the size of book.... SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.  I am using it to take notes for study.  Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it... could not turn the pages.  This is a winner"
7,"I have been making compost for several years now. I have a compost tumbler with a crank handle that rotates it. I started a batch in late winter and was having a hard time getting it to heat up. This compost starter did a great job of really getting it going. If it is really cold outside you will have to be more careful to have your ingredients shredded and in the proper carbon to nitrogen ratio. Otherwise this starter will work well if you have more brown than green. In the summer when I am composting mostly greens. then this starter is pretty much unnecessary. I save some of the finished compost from each batch to start the new batch with. If you are doing a passive pile then this stuff is even more of a help because you can add it to each new layer as you build the pile."
1,"After using one for 7 years or so the old professional gave out finally.  The NEW one I had to buy at Target (sorry Amazon when your toothbrush is broke asap is more important then price).  I did the full charge last night and let it run down without a brush on and I am charging it back up to full.  Just got done using it again before bed.  This electric toothbrush is better then their last model and more powerful.  I can tell by how clean my teeth are.  Thanks a bunch Oral B for the High Quality Product."
10,"My previous blade was an old craftsman 6' dado. Not that i have anything against craftsman (my table saw is great). but these things were so old and worn that they burned the wood away instead of cutting it. This influenced me to get a new set. I am glad i did. With this set. the saw dosen't even bog down in going through the wood. Wonderful to be able to cut something without buring it. Cuts an *almost* flat-bottomed dado. I have only done cuts about 3/8 wide max. and it seems that the chippers leave a *slight* raised area at the middle. I am not sure if this happens with larger sizes. The carbide teeth on the chippers are nice and large. which makes me happy. Now. if it can only help me think straight and not make four left legs instead of two left and two right. Oh well. I'll have to practice more."
1,"I was taking part in a filmmaking seminar in Maine. and everyone had two tools: a Mini Maglite and aLeatherman.  They all wore them on their belts. and they came in handy on numerous occasions.  Of course I picked one up and I love the little holster that comes with it.  If it didn't look dorky I'd probably wear this and a multi-tool all the time.It's not just good for night use.  Changing a fuse. adjusting equipment. finding something under the desk.  For those kinds of everyday. all-the-time uses. the Mini Mag is much more handy and useful than the largerMAGLITE. which I also own and keep in my closet for emergencies and camping.  Highly recommended for its simplicity. utility. and durability."
12,"I have never played anything like this since. Everything from Sly  Racoon. to Ratchet and Clank. owe it to this.Wicked witch Gruntilda takes Banjo's sister to hey layer. miles away in a realistic 3D cartoon world.Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it. You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps. Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way. You can fly. It was amazing. A full adventure all the way to end. We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again. The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time. It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one. This is one of the best N64 games ever."
9,"We've had this stove for upwards of 25 years. and it has withstood the test of time. weather. and all kinds of camping conditions. The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska. Canada's wild lakes (for canoe and kayak camping) and on our average family summer camping vacations.It is lightweight. sturdy and a great way to prepare hot cakes. eggs and coffee in the morning.For larger families. there are of course larger Coleman stoves. But for a family of two to four. this item is perfect."
7,"I think this feeder is just adorable and the finches love it. Although it is made from plastic it is very sturdy and the perches 'lock in' to the tube...generating a very solid feel.  The 'comfort perches' are amazing...the little guys feed longer from this feeder than any other. and the finches who are waiting for 'their turn'. sing up a storm of sweet melodies in anticpation.  The design allows for the seed to stay put without spewing all over and wasting expensive seed.  The size of the 6 little feeder holes discourage larger birds (doves. pigeons) from stealing the seed from the 'little ones'. The screw on cap makes it easy to fill and clean.  I live in Las Vegas so I will be careful not to leave it in the blazing summer sun. I highly recommend this feeder for bird lovers/watchers."
1,"I live in the southwest and had pretty dry skin so my doctor recommended I try this stuff.  After about a week of use. once a day every day. I notice an obvious difference in my skin.  Areas that were dry and peeling aren't anymore and my skin is noticeably softer.  I ordered this size because I like lotions that have a pump. I find I used them more frequently and the bottle isn't as messy. and this one is no exception.  I would certainly recommend this product!"
5,"I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment. Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy. I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version. Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle.I've owned it for a couple of months. used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times. Zero hum or buzz from the unit. I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board."
6,"My wife was having soreness in her wrists that may have signaled the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome. I ordered the Belkin Wave Rest wrist pad. and since she started using it. the soreness has subsided. She loves the pad. It's about an inch wider than the keyboard she's using. so she doesn't have to move her hands off the pad. I've used it a few times. and I liked it enough that I may get one for myself.I think the wrist pad is worth trying for anyone who may be developing carpal tunnel syndrome or any related problem."
7,"The Gilmour Flexogen is definitely the best hose I've ever had. and they are made in the USA.  Thanks Gilmour!  Mine stay outdoors year round (we have mild winters with only a few freezes per year. but very long. hot summers). They are very durable and don't kink.  I have never had a reason to take advantage of the lifetime warranty. but other reviewers indicate that Glimour makes good on their promise even decades later.  I've noticed a few negative reviews here where the reviewer is mistakenly commenting on a completely different hose."
4,"David Barton. as a first-class researcher. has furnished the indisputable historical proof of the godly heritage in the founding of America. Watch and learn as you explore the fascinating details. events. and personalities of US history. Great care is given to the unfolding drama of our nation's godly tradition as the DVD set covers a massive amount of captivating amazing-but-true stories.Some of the topics covered are how faith influenced American:- Education- Religious freedoms- Civil and judicial domains- Cultural and societal arenas- Separation of Church and State- And much moreOver twenty episodes that will thrill you and your whole family. Great for church Bible study or home school."
6,"These are great. functional labels at a very reasonable price.  The 2x4-inch size is big enough for hand-written addresses and still fits 10 to a sheet for economy's sake. many more labels per sheet than the slightly larger sizes without much loss of usability.  The 'TrueBlock' ability to hide what's behind them -- seemingly due to a gray layer behind the labels' white surface. like primer under a coat of paint -- is nice. though this was never a real problem for other labels to begin with.  Simply put. these work great for their purpose."
9,"This is a very nice street hockey set.  The sticks are very durable and they assemble fast with a phillips screwdriver.  The net is assembled by pressing the PVC tubes into the corner joints; Easy to do!  Both sticks work for left or right handers: Only slightly can you notice that one is for left and the other is for right.  However. we have all kinds of neighbor kids use them and they NEVER are concerned about the &#34;proper&#34; fitting of the stick.  They just use them....PERIOD!  Again. a great product and price."
10,"For hardly a little more than the cheapie template guide sets you get a very nice one from Porter cable. The nice thing about it is if you have a Porter cable or Makita router you simply slip the guide into the existing hole in your baseplate and secure it with one of the provided nuts. Insert the right sized bit and you are now ready to go to work on whatever guide you need to follow. Much nicer than changing your base out with one of those universal kits . which use three screws to secure the guide to the base. If you need a template guide kit . you can't go wrong with this one."
10,"I really wanted to like this saw. but ultimately. it is too cumbersome for my taste.  Basically. this is an old fashioned tool that has its merits. but could benefit from modernization.Cons:-Offset from left side of shoe to the blade is ~3 9/16'. making using a straight edge saw guide not the easiest.-My saw arrived with a miscalibrated bevel indicator such that the 0 degree bevel setting was not in fact perfectly square with the blade.-No spindle lock to change the blade -- you have to manually immobilize the blade.-Knurled knobs for depth of cut and bevel adjustments are difficult to adjust and fall off if you unscrew too far.-Motor feels a little bit underpowered and takes a while to get up to speed.-No case.-Worm drive requires checking and maintaining oil level.-Expensive for its lack of modern features.Pros:-Stiff and stable shoe plate that is adequately sized for good support.-Very durable.-Fairly light weight and nimble.-Worm drive provides lots of torque.-Classic tool."
11,"I had great expectations from all the position 4 and 5 star reviews of this game. I have a few board based fantasy games like Descent and Heroscape. both great games giving hours of replayability. and obviously high quality of design and materials. This one disappoints. All of the pieces give the word MINIATURE and new definition. The pieces are so small they are in the description realm of RIDICULOUS. FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity. Some of the pieces. like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4' in height and diameter.  The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well. The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old's hand. The board is quite large. about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard. Not much here folks. especially for the cost of the game. This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price."
9,"Thank you for the nice ear protectors!I have already put them to the test and they work great since my ears have become more sensitive over time and a product like this is like heaven sent.I did not mind the battery installation being a little difficult since maintenance of your equipment requires you to know how.It did come apart easy enough once you know where to install the thin flat screwdriver to separate the ring from the cup.I like it's ability to compact to take little room in a range bag by folding up like a ball."
1,"I purchased quite a few toys over Christmas that required batteries. Luckily Amazon has batteries at a low price in large bulk to cover my needs.The batteries show up in Amazons no frills frustration free packaging with an expiration date several days out. Other individuals. unfortunately. have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and. if you have a volt checker. test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities."
6,"Avery has some of the best products. and this is one.  These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels.  I remember the old days of having to order labels from some company.  Now. you can do all that stuff yourself right at home.  As I mentioned. this is simple for anyone to set up.  The instructions are very clear on how to do this.Not only are these great for making your own return labels.  They are also handy for many different applications such as file folder labels. labels for kitchen items. yard sale price stickers. etc...."
4,"I enjoyed it but was disappointed that even though i chose 55 minute option cardio- kickbox workout sort of stopped at 30 minutes. she then worked our legs for 5 minutes? Then that other guy did training of some sort that I skipped. then another training....which wasted 10-15 minutes and then there was cool down.  The good thing about this DVD is that you can select to play certain segments....only one segment can be played at a time though. Warm up was good. Good 10 minutes but cardio type with some stretches that I didn't do- I skipped rope instead."
6,"The TrueBlock technology works really well.  I had some folders with old labels that I had written on with Sharpies and ballpoint pen.  I have tried using other labels to cover the old writing. but I could always see through them - especially the labels that I had written on with marker.  These folder labels blocked out the old writing completely.Avery's website also has some really nice free online tools to create quick templates for printing labels - no downloads required.  I used the 'Design and Print Online' feature to create a sheet of labels on my MacBook. then I printed the sheet on my Brother laser printer.  It worked really well.  It took me less than 5 minutes to get my labels typed in. choose a font. and get them printed using the manual sheet feeder on my printer.  It was impressively easy."
5,"Seriously. this is a great pedal. I can't improve upon what others have said. but I will mention a few points.1. I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone. or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. It's run before time based effects (delay. phaser. etc) for me.2. I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster. while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. If it gets noisy or 'self oscillates' after a while. change the battery to a fresh one. Better yet. use an AC adapter.I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews. Otherwise. it's been on my setup for about seven years. I take care of my stuff."
9,"While trigger locks are not intended to make a gun safe (you can still place a round in the chanber of most firearms). They can act and serve as a deterrent to the use of the firearm.  The lock easily attaches to the trigger guard of all firearms.  It is only effective on firearms with fixed trigger guards. I prefer a combination lock because it eliminates the need for keeping a keyring with multiple keys.  I keep and store each of my firearms with one of these combination locks."
10,"This product was a fine addition to my Dewalt compound miter saw. It allowed me to securely place eight foot lengths of crown molding on the cutting table. Amazon shipped mine without the end retaining bolt. but I was in too much of a rush with my project to raise concerns. Besides. not having that bolt did not affect the product's performance. Once again. this was a great addition to my saw.Update:This product sucks! It worked well with flimsy MDF crown molding. but is an absolute waste of time with any real wood. No amount of adjustment will make it support my hardwood projects square against the fence. Save your money and build your own fence and table extension."
9,"Have had this lodge round griddle for years now and it hardly ever leaves the top of the stove.  This is the pan we used to fry eggs. potato slices. grilled cheese. garlic toast. etc. Nothing sticks to it. Wipe clean when you're done. add a touch of oil or bacon grease to season. and it's ready for the next meal.Not too bulky on the stovetop either. Cast iron cooks nice and even and you can get it hot enough to put a nice crust on potatoes and/or whatever type of meat you're cooking.Bought this for my husband to use so he would leave my pans (and not mess them up) alone. I find I use this griddle almost as much as he does! This griddle is well worth purchasing!"
11,"Someone told me about Elf on a Shelf earlier this year knowing how into Christmas I am! This is a wonderful idea for parents who want to create a running dialogue with their kids about Christmas and all that goes into it.The book included with the elf tells the story of how Santa knows whether a child is naughty or nice by sending an elf to their home to report back to him each night. As a parent you can put the Elf somewhere and then your kids can play hide and seek to find him. They can also tell the Elf what they want for Christmas and how they would like Christmas to play out.It is easy to put a faith based element into your play and story as well as any other customs you may want to impart. The Elf makes the anticipation for Christmas more keen and kids enjoy playing hide and seek as well as talking to the Elf."
6,"While address labels may not be the most interesting thing I buy. getting good labels that are easy to print does matter to me.  And the Avery White Easy Peel Return Address Labels 8167 were exactly what I was looking for.They truly are. as advertised. easy to peel off the backing.  And they don't smudge after being printed. nor do they jam in the printer.But for me. perhaps the most important thing about labels is the ease of using the printing website.  I found the Avery site easy to use.The bottom line?  Five stars.  Easy to print and use and economical.  Win win win."
10,"I bought one of these in 1990 (maybe 1989).  I am still using it to this day.If you are looking for a impact driver to for 3/4 bolts then this is not for you.  If you need a reliable cordless screwdriver with enough strength to get the job done with out snapping the heads off your screws and bolts then this is what you want....I use it a lot for assembly / disassembly and it is perfect for the job. and with a chuck adapter light drilling.The only problem I have had was the need to replace battery pack once or twice ( amazon carries themMilwaukee 48-11-0100). but that is acceptable in the course of over a decade of use.note: a drill chuck and a 1/4' socket adapter is a must have addition."
10,"Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer. However. if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar. In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle cannot be used without the extension. this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality. Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route. and have succeeded."
4,"Well produced script and story of the man we have come to know and respect as one of the great minds of our time! Enjoyable. considering all they tried to pack in from childhood to fairly current times of his life it flowed fairly well. These types of movies tend to be a bit rushed and corny but the writers.cast.director.editor etc. did a great job! I would recommend it as if focus' on his rise to becoming a downright genius of a surgeon etc. and skips his current personal politics so anyone can pick it up and enjoy it!"
2,"I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.  AWESOME bargain!  My kids have enjoyed apple ring snacks (smeared with peanut butter and sprinkled with granola) and baked apples with brown sugar!  My son has a habit of munching the apple through the core. but will not eat an apple that has been cut up.  This corer has been the perfect solution. as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.  Very sturdy. easy to use and a steal for the price!"
12,"A very exciting and fun fighting game; Super Smash Bros. is definentally worthy of my approval. In this great multiplayer game you fight opponents using awesome moves and killer items. There are also a variety of levels. each containing their own special dangers. The object of the game is to knock your opponent off the edge of the thing you are fighting on. It could range from a spaceship in the star-e-ness of space to the tops of skyscrapers!Each fighter has their own special moves and abilities to crush other fighters with. Their moves are not hard to learn. so you can get pretty good at the game in a relitively short time.Also. Super Smash Bros. doesn't get boring after you beat it. I've had the game for about three. four years and I still love it. And if you get this AWESOME multiplayer combat game hopefully you will too."
10,"definitely a *major* improvement over not having one.I remember having a bit of a problem getting the screw holes in the hood to line up with those in the planer. but no hig hammers or powertools were required to overcome this minor hassle.The silliness is that you can't flip up the outfeed with the  hood mounted. and unmounting the hood each time isn't rational.  My planer is mounted under a workbench. and I just left plenty of clear and in the back.I'd say this ought to be bundled with the planer - which is a  great planer by the way - this tool produces *volumes* of chips!  some form of dust or chip collection is a requirement. packaging it separately is just a form of gouging.I've never noticed any chip compression pitting as described by another reviewer - either with or without the hood.  btw. I'm using a 5.5hp Sears shop vacuum with it."
1,"I got two of these - one for my mom and one for my mother-in-law. both in their 80s.  What I wonder is why i didn't get one for me?  I will be wanting to order another for myself.  These were a big hit for these ladies and so useful.  As we age. we need more light to see what was once easy for us to read.  Often we are in areas where the lighting is poor or minimal.  This answers that need.  If you are looking for a product like this. try it.  It will meet your needs."
11,"My son is 7 and very smart so I thought this could be a good intro to simple programming.  It is definitely a few years beyond him.  I didn't realize that Recon would do nothing at all on a basic toy level--it is all somewhat serious programming.  There's really nothing my son can do with it at this point so we will be storing it away for future use.  Once he gets to the level he needs to be. I'm sure this will be a delightful learning toy."
6,"I've long been a fan of Avery products. Every time I buy an off-brand just to save a few cents. I always end up with paper jams or unusable smudged. smeared. or incorrectly placed labels. Avery products are always well-made and supported by every device that I use in my office. The Avery File Folder Labels are no exception.Speaking of software and formats. even if the program you have doesn't support Avery (I can't imagine which one that would be...) you can go to their website and download templates or even use their website to print! (This one is great because our office includes not only PC's but also several Linux machines).Lastly. I was happily surprised to see the inclusion of 2 'Box Tops'. My children's school does an excellent job of collecting these and turning them in. It is nice to finally see these great incentives on products other than snack food.When is a label not just another label? When it's an Avery label! :)"
7,"I see some reviews state that this is just a smaller version of the larger kettle grills&#8230; and that&#8217;s not quite true. This one is not portable unless you grab the whole grill&#8230; there&#8217;s no way to pick up the whole unit by the handle. The kettles have a handle and wheels so you can roll it around&#8230;once lit this unit isn&#8217;t going anywhere. Also. there&#8217;s no place to put the lid once it&#8217;s removed&#8230; the kettles have a hook so you can hang the lid right on the kettle but all you can do with this one is lay it on a table or the ground. Other than that&#8230; it&#8217;s a perfect grill for the two of us. it&#8217;s easy to assemble. it&#8217;s built rugged and it&#8217;s easily worth 5-stars. I would have given it 4-stars had I not known beforehand that it cannot be moved with the handle&#8230; when it&#8217;s cold you can just throw a bungee cord on and you&#8217;re good to go."
6,"The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. We bought three of these (one for our house. shop. and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (likeBelkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which. although limited. does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is 'backlit' and draws power directly from the phone line. allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial. we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH"
5,"This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  We've used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and it's nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.  Guitar folk will like this unit with the fx features."
6,"Return address labels save you time. and the Avery system is easier-to-use than many.These labels perform exactly as described. They feed perfectly. are perfectly spaced on the label sheet. are easy to peel and position. and they can be repositioned many times yet still stick firmly.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5267Type in what you want on the labeland Print.The label sheet even shows you which end to insert in your printer.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking return address labels."
2,"I love this little guy!  I use it for just about everything!  I make salad dressing all the time. and yesterday I made topping for a cherry crumble.  Easy to use. easy to clean!  I never put any of the parts in the dishwasher. I think its ok to do so. but from past experience. these sort of items tend to wear out more quickly if they are subject to the heat of dishwasher drying. so I don't do it.  This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.  Great for gifts too!"
12,"For those who don't know this is the very first Spyro game. This is such an awesome game.Pros1. The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated. but looking back they are comical.2. The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3. The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [Spoiler Alert!] the reason Gnasty Gnorc (the main villain) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4. There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1. I can't think of any"
4,"After taking a few kickboxing classes at my gym (and loving it). I picked up this tape.  I had heard of Kathy Smith. but had never seen any of her tapes. but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular.  Her approach is calm and knowledgeable. and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move.  Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this. but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!  Great for those mornings when it's just too cold/wet/much trouble to get to the gym. and good for the kickboxing newcomer."
12,"This game is awesome! It's a must have. This game must have the most color in history! It has many levels just like the Original for regular nintendo. Plus it hs a few more opotions. It has a challenge mode which is extremely hard. a Vs mode so you can play your friends. and a &quot;You VS Boo Mode.&quot; It's a very good buy. You'll like it!I got a secret to tell ya too. There are secret levels in this game that are beyond hard! You have to get over 5000000 points in the original mode. If you think about it. it's not so hard to get that many points. It's actually really easy.Well I HIGHLY recommend you buy this album. It's a good buy. well worth your money. and it's fun.Don't forget. this game is for GBC ONLY! That means Game Boy Color."
4,"This is an inspiring movie about Ben Carson. the neurosurgeon who was the first to separate conjoined twins who were connected at the head. This is the story of his life from childhood on and how he (and his brother. as well) received victory over struggling with adversity and anger issues and went on to become successful. He owed his overcoming of trials to God and also his mother who encouraged them to never give up and to know they could do whatever they wanted to do in life. Ben Carson is a very gentle. humble. peaceful man.This is a great movie for youngsters. young adults. and older as well. Very inspirational story for anyone."
9,"Arrived fast. I blew it up to check for holes since we don't plan on using it until this summer. The oars were fairly easy to assemble. The pump is cheap and fell apart easily but we have a nicer one that we use anyway. The kids loved playing in the boat once it was blown up (even if only in the living room). I can't wait to take this to the lake this summer. It's going to be a huge hit with the kids. Deflated easily for storage."
1,"I had this Interplak until for just over 1 year and it just stopped working for no apparent reason. The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out. the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt. Overall I'd rate this unit as 'build quality: poor. life span: short. effectiveness: disappointing'."
10,"To be honest. even though I have been an avid woodworking hobbyist for 40 years. I have never used a plunge router.  Already having a pretty healthy herd of routers. the last thing I need was another router. so instead. I ordered this plunge router base.  I am absolutely amazed at how it changes my previously fixed base routers.  It is almost infinitely adjustable. very well manufactured and has completely revolutionized the inlay work I do.  With the plunge base. it becomes a breeze to take progressively deeper passes. to a predetermined depth with each pass. simply by turning the depth turret.This is a surprisingly useful addition to my router arsenal.  I love it."
12,"I've played this game many. many times. But unfortunately. it's one of those games that you will either love or hate. which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly. gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun. especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans. but like I said. don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do. some don't. Simple as that"
1,"In an urgent need to fix badly cracked/chapped lips I turned to Amazon to find a lip balm.I first tried outBurt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm Tube. .15-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)only to end up with no improvement after 3 or so days. Although this might not be a fair amount of time I was in agony over my lips and needed a quick fix. I was in need of moisturizing my lips and repairing them. not just protecting them from further damage.I turned to Mentholatum Natural Ice hoping this would be an improvement over Burt's (for me. not that either product is bad) only to find out they were pretty much the same. There was no noticeable difference and my lips weren't improving after another 3 days.I would recommend this product for proactive lip protection. but I would look elsewhere for a moisturizing lip balm when being reactive to cracked/chapped lips."
4,"&quot;George Lucas in Love&quot; is the funniest eight minute short movie that I have ever seen.  What if George Lucas. the creator of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. had a muse. like &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; suggests that the Bard did?  Well. imagine George Lucas living in a dorm at USC. struggling to create a short picture.  And then the fun begins.  This short is laden with layer after layer of inside jokes.  I've watched it over a dozen times. and each time I see another joke that I missed before."
10,"I use this cordless screwdriver at work as a HVAC/refrigeration tech. It works okay. Not as strong as I expected and the battery does not last as long as I expected. I had a Craftsman cordless (made by Black & Decker) before. The battery on that one would last a week with frequent use. this one only lasts a day or two. Maybe there is a better battery available. haven't checked. The old one was more for home use so it did break after just a year or so with what I use it for. this one has a 5 year warranty which is good."
10,"I have owned the DeWalt vertical clamp for about a year now. and it works well on my DW703 compound miter saw.  It is a bit large and clunky. and your finger can get slightly pinched by the release button. but the clamp is solidly built and holds tight every time.  If there is a fault. it's with the miter saw itself.  The holes for the clamp post in the saw's base could be placed better. and the saw wasn't designed with other clamping methods in mind.  In many instances. the DeWalt clamp is the only possible way to hold the work piece in place."
5,"I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way. once plugged in. it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar. a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good. if not better.  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole. this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar."
7,"This is the 2nd roll I've purchased. so that should tell you how much I like it.  I got a 50' roll first. and liked it enough to buy another 25' roll so I would have enough and some extra to cover all my yard.This is the first hose I've used/owned that you didn't have to be super careful not to kink.  It always seemed like the higher end the hose was. the softer it was. and the more it would kink on me.  I can just roll/unroll this hose when I need it. and no issues so far.  Highly recommended."
6,"I needed more space for 'digital devices'. I have a laser printer and needed a place to put the office scanner I just purchased. This fits perfectly on top of the printer without making the printer unusable. The paper comes out of the printer and the scanner sits right on top of this awesome device.The stand is metal and very sturdy. It can easily hold an old CRT monitor... though. who even has one nowadays?It is marketed as a monitor stand. but you can (obviously) use it wherever you want and put whatever you want on it."
11,"I saw this game on the cover of a magazine. and in several stores. and it was all the awards it received that got my attention. I needed a game that me and my husband could play with our kids. (ages 6 and 14). That is not an easy task to find a game for such a broad spectrum of ages. We usually stick with Uno. But this looked promising. so we picked it up. We played it wrong the first couple of times. but with each play we figured out the rules better. (it is not one that you can just skim over the rules and 'get it' right away. But once you do 'get it' it is super simple.) It kind of works like Uno crossed with the strategy of Scrabble. We love it."
10,"Stanley has been making planes for a long time. They do know what they are  doing. I have a few of these around for general purpose work . I also have  some Lie Nielsons and I love them but I keep them safe and out of reach of  others'. I don't care who uses the Stanleys. I know if they get ruined .  I'm not out much. With a little tuning a stanley will do a respectable job.  Lap the sole and the iron .put a good bevel on it and it will cut  aggressively or produce a fine shaving. The adjustable throat is a must for  avoiding tearout. I like the low angle version of this plane a little  better. It is easier to control .It also makes a finer cut. It won't cut as  deep however. To get a better plane you will have to spend at least twice  as much so this is not a bad deal."
12,"Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 and does not own Mario Kart should just throw it away.This is a classic N64 game that's a ton of funeven today where there are games with better graphics.The point of the game is simple: win the race by any means.There are no plot twists. no complicated storylines.It has all the classic Mario characters includingMario. Luigi. Peach. Bowser. Wario. Toad. Yoshi and others.Once you finish everything. there is a bonus optionwhere you can play all levels again but backwards!Seriously. this game is an awesome classicand a great addition to any and all N64 game collections.Overall.5/5"
6,"Great product we used it mount all our travel photos above are bed. One helpful hint. be sure to allow the paint to cure for a few weeks. so that it doesn't lifts off easily. Also. we found it worked best when you prime the walls before you paint it makes a difference when using mounting tape. The paint and texture don't come off so easily when you take the tape off later--which is great. We change out the photos every few months when we go on another trip. We have some photos that have been up for over a year and there is no lift in the corners like you see with other mounting two side tape."
6,"I have routinely spent a lot of money on nice. colorful gift wrap and then. when I get the gift wrapped all that seems to stand out is the tape that is used to seal the package.  This gift wrap tape actually becomes invisable on the package and lets your gift wrap show through.  It doesn't cost much more to make your gift wrapping look really professional.  I used this tape on both a solid blue colored wrap and a mulit-colored paper and it worked great on both.  It was also invisable where I used the tape to attach the little envelope with the gift tag and note.  I recommend this tape and will probably end up using it for more than just gift wrapping.. it's a very nice tape for everyday use as well."
10,"Check your blades. This goes for all brands of planers. The dullness factor creeps in ever so slowly and you may not be aware that your blades are too dull. I felt the old blades and they seemed sharp. but the normally fairly quiet Makita seemed too loud and the boards were not sliding smoothly through.The new blades were obviously much sharper and things went back to normal once installed. The Amazon price was the lowest I saw and they arrived quickly. although strangely packed in a big torn-up box.So. don't be cheap. Be proactive and replace those blades. You spent a lot of money on the machine. so keep it working well. Same goes for bandsaw blades (same basic experience). saw blades. etc. It is an expensive hobby for some and a business expense that can't be circumvented for others."
12,"This game rocks the most. Quite possibly the best racing game for the N64. Beetle Adventure Racing packs so much into a single game pak that you wonder just what exactly does go on inside of that cartridge. Unlike other N64 racing games. BAR look just as darn good as anything you'd find on many Dreamcast games. The graphics are lush. Plus. there's stuff going on off of the track. Trains go by. warehouses operate and some freaky looking pumpkin things dance around. It offers much more to look at than. say. any Crusin' title. The control is superb. even the poor handling cars are a blast to play with. There's a Goldeneye multiplayer rip off where your car is outfitted with missles and bombs and the such. you get to go around collecting beetles which is just an excuse to kick the living daylights out of your annoying kid brother. Not that we :cough: ever do that."
10,"Everyone loves this saw. or so it seems from the reviews.  I like this saw as well. I own it.  I've had it for over a year and a half and I've cut everything from 1x4s to 6x6s. mostly for framing.  I still think it lacks power compared to a worm drive. which isn't all that much more expensive.  Here's what I'd like you to consider before buy a circular saw: try out a worm drive before buying anything. Brakes are a definate plus. for you don't want to slow down when you're on a roll and they make for a downright safer cut.  Also consider the $60 Skil 13amp saw with a laser.  Skil is a great name when it comes to circular saws. and what a great price.  If you want to spend more look at the Skil worm drive saw.  If you want to buy milwaukee. buy the version of this circular saw with a brake. you'll thank yourself later."
1,"It took me a while to realize that one has to keep these closed when not in use (a few days between cleaning) otherwise it evaporates. Naively. I assumed that whoever designed the cleaner for my braun shaver thought of it already. But they did not.OK. that part can be dealt with - just keep your original cover. and put it back on every time after use.But what surprised me the most was that my cleaner says that the refill is empty when it is not. It is more then half full.Now I am motivated to figure out how to refill these on my own with 99% pure alcohol..."
6,"Getting divider labels to look good has been one of my challenges. If you need dividers for presentations or just to look good it's almost impossible to get most labels to print out with the right alignment. Others I've tried I had to waste a whole sheet to get a couple of labels printed.These clear labels with the templates worked fantastic. The templates. printing. and results were flawless. The dividers themselves are tough. reinforced. bright white. and very crisp. I make binders and presentation materials that I can be proud of - and for my sales efforts help me win by being a notch better than my competitors. One of the few products that I use consistently and would not think of changing from."
9,"Bought this air mattress for camping out with the kids. Used it a couple times. with several different size people (child to large adult). everyone seemed to find it comfortable.  I like the fabric surface. still want to try it with only a blanket underneath and cover.  I have difficulty lying in one spot. this is an issue for this mattress. as it's not wide enough to roll over. etc.  Overall. I found the mattress a good value.Pros:PriceSurface material (not all vinyl)Length is very good. I'm 5' 10&#34;. plenty of room leftCan handle a heavy person (230 lb) without hitting groundCons:Width - which is obvious from looking at it online"
1,"You've been out camping in the woods for 3 days without a shower or a clean change of underwear - and your nether regions are ablaze and itching. Do you cancel your camping trip and ruin everyone's trip? Well. that would be my choice - but then again. you want to commune with nature. too - right? Stick a tube of this in your first aid kit for just such a situation. When parts are itching non-stop. it's hard to think straight. much less enjoy yourself doing anything - sleeping. eating. driving. etc.  The Maximum Strength formula helps to extinguish the flames of pain coming from your... uh... parts until you can get back to civilization and/or a trip to your doctor to make sure you didn't accidentally wipe with poison ivy leaves while camping."
2,"The metal scraper loop that expels the ice cream is unbelievably flimsy and very tenuously attached on both ends. Although it worked well as a muffin disher. it deformed and popped out the first time I tried to scoop ice cream from a batch I made that was frozen just a bit over soft serve (I would never use ANY sweeper scoop - even well-made ones like theNorpro 3-Tablespoon Stainless Steel Scoop- to dish ice cream any harder than that). Waste of money. Look elsewhere.And for dishing ice cream only. of any degree of hardness. try theZeroll Original 3-Ounce Aluminum Ice Cream Scoop."
6,"The cart is well made. craftsmanship. assembly. etc. no complaints.My only gripe is that the shelves are (to me) up-side-down.  I dont want the 'lip' on the shelf pointing upwards.  Most of my wire shelves have the lip pointing down at the front tip of the shelf.  This makes it more convenient to pull out larger jugs off the shelf.  I suppose some can argue that the jugs could slip off while one moves the cart. so it is better to have the lip pointing up.99% of the time the cart is stationary for me.  only a few times a year I would move it out of the utility room to make more room for carrying bulky things through the utility room.  That said. I would rather have at least the top and center shelves to have the lip pointing down."
11,"Elder sign by Fantasy Flight Games is a really fun game! The artwork is well designed and the game requires a few minutes of easy set up but can be played anywhere due to the lack of a board. The rules are easy to follow. and if you can roll dice you can play Elder Sign. Each game is unique which is why we love it so much. The collection of &#34;missions&#34; allows you to play a new game each time you take it out of the box which gives this game some longevity as far as playability in the long run. One of the other nice things is you can play it alone. or with several others. It makes for a great family game with anyone from i'd say age 12 and up. Great and affordable way to start your game nights too!"
1,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers. which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer. they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's. not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)  I'd try a Norelco or Remington. but I think they're all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company (Gillette?).  I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towel--or trying a Panasonic."
12,"The original Mario Kart for the SNES was fun. and a good effort for the limited capabilities of the SNES platform. Mario Kart 64 made full use of the N64's 3-D capabilities. making for a very fun and successful game. Up to four players can engage in the game. and the racecourses are as colorful and rich as they are varied. Each character has their own racecourse (Peach's castle. Bowser's castle. Yoshi's canyons. Donkey Kong's jungle. and so on and so forth) plus more that are just fun and varied. like a beach. the desert. snowfields. and the Rainbow Road.You can play against the computer and compete for various cups. and each set of courses has various levels of difficulty. You get cool items to aid your progress on the track (or hinder the progress of others) There is also a VS mode where two to four players can battle against one another. Overall this is a really great game for the Nintendo 64."
7,"This product was easy to set up and start using. The sprayer is battery operated so spraying it around the garden was a breeze. Fortunately there are no deer in our area. but I have all sorts of smaller critters digging up my garden... squirrels. rabbits. cats. and raccoons.  I applied this product a few weeks ago to certain parts of my garden that I have noticed digging in and so far so good. The areas have not been dug up again (which is usually what happens when I repair the damage the critters have caused).  I will update my results when more time has passed. I really like that this product is pretty much odorless. I have used other products in the past that were really nasty smelling. They not only kept the critters away. but they kept me and other family members away because the garden smelled so bad."
7,"I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient.  After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping. we just felt that it didn't cut it.  We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them. so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time).  Also. I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes.  The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges.  The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves.  I cannot speak for the weedwacker. as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it."
11,"Ticket to Ride is the board game I most often reach for when I have family visiting. For the middle-school aged nephews and the 'hard to teach an old dog new tricks' crowd. Ticket to Ride is very easy to pick up on the rules.And those rules? They can be boiled down to 'It's like Gin Rummy ... with little plastic trains'. Collect cards of matching color sets. then use those sets to claim your tracks to connect cities into a grand network. But watch out for your fellow railbarons. who might have designs for that Los Angeles to El Paso route!Even though I also play quite complex and multi-layered board games. I've never not had fun with Ticket to Ride. It plays quickly. and even the slowest to learn players pick up on how to do well in just a couple rounds."
7,"I cut down two very dead shrubs today using these and was very impressed with these lightweight loppers.  I didn't think I'd get the heavier two-inch branches cut because these loppers are so light. but with the right grip the gear holds the wood down and cuts the branch cleanly in half with little effort.  I'm not the strongest person out there and I'm certainly no Hercules. but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively. once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy.  And. since they are somewhat long. you can also reach up rather high.  Overall. a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it. and look impressive in my tool corner."
12,"The N64 had its share of ups and downs. but when it hit up. boy does it hit it. This is the ultimate party game. Invite some friends over. order a pizza. and watch the mayhem unfold. The controls and graphics have aged well. with the colors remaining bright and colorful and the moves still being easy to pull off.The one downside is that the single player mode hasn't aged as well. Unlocking the four hidden characters is pretty simplistic. though it's hard to fault a 14ish year old game for that. This is a fantastic buy for anyone who wants to start up their collection of N64 games or for anyone looking for a great party experience"
2,"this is my 3rd Eureka Quick Pick Up cordless sweeper. They are great for picking up cat and dog hair and light floor cleaning. I use it daily as I have 2 inside cats.. I would not recommend it for heavy duty carpet cleaning as it is not powerful enough to do a thorough job.It's easy to clean the filter cup but is a little dirty to do so. Just empty the filter cup. rinse it out and the container and allow it to dry before placing on the sweeper.I am pleased it has an extra battery. The previous two did not.If you want a light weight easy to use cordless sweeper. you won't be disappointed"
7,"The size of this item as described is the very maximum outside dimensions.  Anything you want to put inside it will need to fit the interior of a box about 2 inches less on width. length and height.  Not saying the info is deceptive. just not as clear as it might be!  I have a small air compressor that I thought would fit inside it because it is a bit less than the 21 inch height from the description but the inside of the box is a little under 18&#34;.  I was able to make it work by leaving out the bottom tray and trimming away some of the reinforcing ribs in the lid...which reduces the strength making it unsuitable for sitting on but I didn't plan to sit on it anyway."
11,"PROS: Easy game to learn. Educational for US. Geography. Moderate luck factor.CONS: Not recommended for avid game players. Only moderate strategy.Ticket to ride is fun. it's got some strategy to it. but I've played better. In fact. the European version adds a few more variants that greatly improve on the game. I would recommend this game for beginners. For highly competitive game board fanatics. one or two plays of this version and you'll move on. Best just to skip to the European version."
4,"I can't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches. Frankly. I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets. If anything. it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen. If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion. I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread. Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness. but you won't find them in this sick piece of trash."
10,"Recently took advantage of a Porter Cable combo set--buy their biscuit joiner and get their 1 3/4 HP classic router free. Good buy. Had one of these routers years ago. gave it to my son and have missed it ever since. Problem is it came with a standard two-handled base. Outfitted the router with this D-handle-- which offers great control. Only problem is the router  has a long cord which has to be bundled up when using the D-handle to keep the cord out of the way. Pricey but worth it."
4,"Much has been said about this movie and you've probably heard all you need to hear about it.  To me. it was a violent albeit beautifully made movie.  It has heart; it's brutal. poignant. moving. and heart breaking.  It's obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into the making of The Passion of the Christ.  Was it anti-Semitic?  I didn't think so.With all the controversy swirling around The Passion. my best recommendation is to go see the movie and decide for yourself."
9,"After a traumatic experience with my old knife (also Swiss Army) that involved an impossible to open wine bottle. I was in need of a new knife.  I searched and searched with the following requirements.  It had to have both a small and large blade.  It needed a phillips and flat screwdriver.  It also needed the punch. toothpick. and tweezers.  I found what I needed in the tinker.  Its two blades wide. and the length in the description is accurate. no extra bulges in my pocket.  I can easily say that i use it 4-5 times a day."
2,"I use the TN311C heavy-duty grounded timer to control the ON-OFF cycle of a dehumidifier.  I actually bought two units - the 2nd one as a back-up - and. removed all of the 'ON' and 'OFF' trippers from the back-up unit to use on this one.  This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles. and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.  I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.  It keeps our area perfectly dehumidified. and the humidity rise is only 4% to 5% during the OFF cycle.I would recommend this timer to anyone considering a use similar to mine."
7,"Starting a compost pile has been on my list of things to do. I was unfamiliar with this product but after reading about it I was impressed.Although it'll take some time to determine if this stuff is a miracle worker. it has gotten me excited about using grass clippings. leaves. and other lawn debris to start a compost pile. The ingredients included in the easy-to-use box will hopefully 'heat up' the pile and get it into compost more quickly.I'll provide an update when I see evidence that it worked. Until then. though. it has gotten me started on composting."
6,"I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive. but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels!  They're so easy to use. just follow the guidelines provided by Avery and voila. you'll have instant return address labels!  I didn't have any trouble fitting the entire 3-line address onto this label as some others have mentioned. and my favorite part was the fact that they don't smear!  They're easy to peel off and adhere quite well to the envelope. box. etc.  With all the ebay shipping I do. these have come quite in handy.Great product. highly recommend!"
10,"This is by far the best router that I have used. and I've used them all! It is incredibly powerful. quiet. well designed. easy to handle. and light. The soft start feature is a huge plus. The variable speed is very helpful. Heck of a deal for the money.I use this tool with the Bosch Deluxe edge guide to make trim and moulding. No question this is professional level tool that great for homeowner and contrator.I love this thing!  I have yet to find something I don't like."
2,"If you want the best. smoothest. creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.  This one is perfect for home cooking.  The ricer is simple yet well made. strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.  The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.  I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.  I primarily purchased the ricer for making mash potatoes but I'm sure I will use it with vegetables too - mashed root vegetables are a delicious and healthier change from potatoes.  I'm very glad that I finally purchased this ricer. I was tired of using a hand masher and whipping with a electric hand-held mixer and not getting the results that I wanted even after all the work.  If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go."
4,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL. LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON. SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD. BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO# 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST. I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED. I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE. SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA. AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE."
1,"THis medication works. because it actually KILLS the bacteria in your bladder because it is converted to Formaldehyde when it reaches the bladder.  It also has salicylate in it (Asprin) to kill the inflammation which causes the symptoms of pain.It really WORKS and used to be a prescription medication.  A relative of mine had a UTI and called her doctor to get an appointment. but surprisingly. the doctors office instructed her to first try Cystex and if no relief in a few hours they would be happy to see her. It really does work."
4,"Master.Things are going very smoothly. Undoubtedly.Emmerich's pervasive presence has allowed meto persevere on the set; it's the same spiritualforce I believe that will catapult this film to thetop of the box office. In my ponderings. I can'thelp but wonder if these same forces are what aidedher in her levitating and astral projecting. Itake devilsh delight in believing so.If you would kindly send me another copy of 'TheDolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ' I wouldbe indebted to you. Unfortunately. my copy wascovered in blood. It seems to be everywhere. I justcan't help myself sometimes. And I can't help butfeel wholly nostalgic as I'm transported back tothe blood-drenched fields of Scotland and SC.The Director"
1,"This product contains way too much sugar for me. I just compared Metamucil (48.2 Oz Container) to Benefiber (18.7 Oz Container). and found the following:With Metamucil you get 114 servings per container.Serving Size: 12g (One rounded Tbsp)Calories Per Serving: 45Total Carb: 12gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 2gSugars: 9gIron: 0.8mgSodium: 5mgPotassium: 30With Benefiber you get 115 servings per container.Serving Size: 4.6g (Two Tsp)Calories Per Serving: 15Sodium: 0gTotal Carb: 4gDietary Fiber: 3gSoluble Fiber: 3gSugar: 0gMetamucil is tasty but it gets too thick to drink if not consumed immediately. Benefiber is a little more expensive. but at least I'm not paying for sugar and putting on weight from the empty calories.Please rate this review if you found it helpful."
4,"This movie is more like a propaganda film. None of us will ever know for sure about the historical Jesus. since he lives more in myths and beliefs than in historical chronicle. How did Mr Gibson know about the level of cruelty shown? Moreover. Jesus was depicted more like the conventional iconography--caucasian male with a beard and long hair. How did a hard working carpenter look in 2000 yrs old Middle East? Certainly not like the one shown.However. this movie did one good thing for me: reminded me about the necessity to cultivate compassion for fellow human beings. On the other hand. for the simple-minded. literal believer. this movie will generate hate. vengeance. and totally undeserving surge of emotion.From that standpoint. I must say. this movie fell short as a visual art.Watch it. but please 'watch out' about what you feel."
10,"I'm using this on cedar furniture to get it super smooth and it works great. The paper is a bit thin so it can sometimes fold and crease when sanding across slats but I've sanded several chairs and tables and outside of the first sheet folding because I wasn't paying attention they have performed flawlessly. Plus. They seem to last quite a long time and I've barely dented the box; one sheet will easily last me about three chairs (these are large. deep-seated slat chairs) or 2 tables each. For comparison I go through about one sheet of 120 grit per chair and 1.5 sheets of 120 per table. I will buy these again and again. when I run out in a few years."
4,"When this film debuted in 1994 as a miniseries on television. at a time when biblical stories were being made into miniseries. I was skeptical because I had been disappointed in the stories of Abraham and Jacob.This film. though. is the best filmed biblical interpretation of the life of Joseph.  It is truly astounding with a stellar cast!  Paul Mercurio is incomparable as Joseph and deserved an emmy for his performance.  He tears the heart right out of you!  No less superb is Lesley Ann Warren as Potiphar's lascivious wife who tries to snare him into her web but fails.This film is incredible and not to be missed!  I always cry buckets of tears at the end!  A true masterpiece in every way!"
1,"My Physical Therapist recommended this to me to help with tissue mobility above the area where I had a plate and screws put into my fibula where I had surgery for a broken bone.  It seems to have a positive effect however the scar is still quite visible.  It may have helped reduce the visibility of the scar but the effect is not as significant as it would seem from the pictures provided on the box.  That said it did accomplish what my PT wanted but I don't give 5 stars because I don't see it as a &#34;must have&#34; or &#34;must buy&#34; which I consider a 5 star rating to be."
10,"I really like my DeWalt sliding compound miter saw. and got this bag for it when I started using the saw in my garage shop (as opposed to outdoors projects) for dust control. It is only a little bit better than using the saw without it. I would say the dust capture is 20% at best.I found that I am a lot better off for dust capture if I attach my shop vacuum to the port where this bag is supposed to attach and have active suction to pick up the dust. This captures about half or more of the dust. Overall. though. it seems that there is a reason there are dust hood systems with large hoods to capture miter saw dust into a collector: a lot of the dust does not exit through the blade guard. but spews right off the top of the cut.Conclusion: don't bother with this. it's not good value and it gets in the way."
10,"Although I had to drill holes to fit my Craftsman drill press. the basic setup was reasonably easy.  The result was a very sturdy little stand -- perfect for many bench top tools.  Its weight and construction make for a very stable base.  Comparing it to. for example. a similar stand (sold by the same store from which I bought the drill press.) there is simply no comparison to be made.  This Delta stand is far superior.  I will probably buy another soon for my bench grinder."
4,"Nice drama- based on the original Christmas Carol movie.  This version stars Henry Winkler as Scrooge and takes place during the Depression in America.  Winkler plays Scrooge as a business owner who offers home furnishings to be paid off over time.  But most people can.t pay off the entire bill due to job scarcity - etc- and Winkler ends up repossessing much of what he has &#34;sold&#34;.  Soon &#34;ghosts&#34;- ( passed aquaintances in this version)- of Chistmas past. present. and future appear taking Winkler back through time and into the future showing him his past and what the future holds in store for one of his &#34;value system&#34; .  Winkler realizes that he best become more kinder and more considerate of the needs of his town neighbors or risk dying a lonely and embittered man.  Dramatic with poignant scenes.  Held my attention throughout!"
5,"These are by no means touring cases. They're inexpensively made. which is a good thing because I hate to pay for a case that cost half of what the guitar cost and I don't tour. That said. they do a great job at protecting guitars that aren't out on a stand. I've got about a dozen guitars and when they're not gonna be played anytime soon I want to put them away in something more substantial than a gig bag. These do very nicely for that purpose. They are certainly more than capable of taking an instrument to a gig. but I wouldn't put a pricey guitar into this case if I new baggage handlers or shipping gorillas were going to be handling it. So. I recommend them. but be aware of its limitations."
1,"ONE STAR:The Maxell LR44 10-pack photo shows the new hologram packaging. but I received the old orange & black packaging.The batteries are stale. Lights powered by them are semi-bright. and only last a day or so.The orange & black pack rates 1-star.FIVE STARS:From the same supplier. MyBatterySupplier. I ordered the50-pack. which did come in the new hologram package. and the difference was dramatic.  Lights powered by the batteries were brilliant. and I expect them to last much longer.The new hologram pack rates 5-stars."
5,"been using these cables for three months now. I use them with aZoom G1N Guitar Multi Effects Pedaland they sound great. decided to get this one over the cheaper ones because after doing a little online research I found out that these are suppuosed to take abuse and hold their own better over time. they have a good lenght. of course this being taken in consideration what type of venues you'll be playing. so far I've only used them in rehearsal studios but will be using them live for the first time in a couple of halloween gig I've got coming up the end of the month."
4,"I learned a lot about our nation's history that simply isn't taught in our classrooms anymore.  David Barton lays out the facts.  This is the History of our nation in the words of the men who made the history.  The recent textbook battle in Texas was largely over this issue: getting the real history of our nation back into the history books.  I can understand why people with a certain political agenda wouldn't want this information out there. but if you want the whole truth and not the current edited version of history that is being taught in so many of our classrooms today. this is for you."
7,"I don't have any problems with this and neither do the birds. We fill it with a sugar/water mix rather than feeding the poor little critters a load of crummy additives. they really don't care that the water isn't red and the artificial coloring is suspected of giving them health issues.Anyway. I just unscrew it from the cap when I want to clean and fill it. then empty any remaining solution down the drain in the yard and wash it off with the hose before taking it indoors (sugar water really attracts dirt in a carpet. ask me how I know).I have not found it difficult to clean. Once refilled I take it out again. still upside down. and then turn it over before anything significant can leak out. Then just screw it back in to the cap."
10,"I have owned ny DeWalt for about eight months. Sometimes the on/off switch gets caught but really no trouble. I have probably put close to 500 hours of heavy duty work with this. C &amp; D side plywood. raw wood as well as refinishing. I just had to replace the pad today as it losts its grip on the sandpaper. But again a very minor problem. My sole major problem is how hot the handle gets after about two hours of consistent sanding. However. the finish is beautiful and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,"It's a good sturdy brush. bends well. fits in what I need it for. but the bristles are only slightly rougher than a generic bottle brush. I use it clean glass bottles I fill with juice (from a juicer). and it doesn't get anything stuck on. It also stains easy. However. the grip is comfortable and it's a good length for 16oz glass bottles. and if you can find a different way to get things unstuck. it works just fine. I just wish it was rougher and a little longer wouldn't hurt. It does the job but aside from real sturdiness it's not much better than a generic brush."
9,"Canon makes the best stuff and now these are my favorite Binoculars. They work GREAT! I always see a lot of unsteadiness when I hold a pair of Binoculars for any period of time while zooming in as far as possible. These though have a button on them which engages a gyroscope (That's what the documentation says) of some sort and totally steadied the image. I walked around using them and they work GREAT! I have yet to try them aboard and boat of from a moving land vehicle. but as the Documentation also states there are apt to be problems with that sort of use. I totally recommend these as being Fantastic Binoculars. Canon always seems to cos more than other devices. I also own a few of their Cameras and Lenses. but you get what you pay for. I have come to like Canon products very much and plan on using their products in the future."
10,"Delta's information is best described by a four letter word starting with an S.  So the next guy knows:  I successfully installed this on a 10' Left-Tilt Contractor's Saw. model number 36-979.  I was only able to use one screw. however it is attached and solid.  I had minimal difficulties installing and aligning.  At some point I may machine some form of block to act as future lockdown.  My 36-979 came with three holes around the bracket. and I had to play a bit to find the one that fit best.  Once on. it works fine."
12,"This was a very addictive game. with lots of fun involved. When I first saw this game. I thought it would reek. because the fighting scenes aren't great. But this game is a lot more than just fighting. it's an awesome RPG. maybe one of the best. Some of the bad language is not needed. but it's easy to look past that.One thing that really bugged me was that in some parts it was just too hard. and you could walk around for hours and not figure out what you were supposed to do. But other than that it was great.  You can actually play arcade games inside this game. and there is even a place where you can shoot some hoops! There is a big mix inside this. you can drive a motorcycle. a chocobo :}. and some hover crafts. This game is really fun. and has I think about 50 hours of gameplay on three different discs. so go out and get yours today!Jesse"
10,"Fact is I need this thing. It fits my PC circular saw great. It's very light weight and long enough to not get in the way when ripping sheet goods. I have it connected to my shop vac and it does a good job collecting the stuff that would otherwise be flying through the air. But step back for a minute. It's just a plastic hose. The same stuff you can by a HD for 50 cents a foot. Ah. but the stuff at HD is not the right diameter. Gotcha. Man I wish some of this dust collection stuff would be more standard. PC is a 1&quot; end. my miter saw is 2&quot;. my vacuum accessories are 1 1/4. my band saw is 2 1/2. You get the picture. I've got a drawer full of adapters. This fits the bill but they know you can't go out and buy it elsewhere. Shame."
11,"My 3 year old grandaughter absolutely loves puzzles and is quite good at putting them together.  When I gave her this Jumbo Puzzle to work on she quickly put it together as well.  The one thing that frustrated her was we put it together on the carpet and it wasn't flat enough.  I think she didn't think she was doing it correctly when it didn't seem to snap together easily.  I would recommend putting this together on a smooth surface. large table. wood floor.  Other than that one frustration. my grandaughter loved it.  It has a little handle on the box. so the puzzle pieces can be neatly stored away and the child can carry the box."
5,"I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58. but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree."
1,"For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks. oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I'd gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I'd try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped. peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn't stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product."
4,"This is a very basic cooking dvd. which I think is good for everyone. even if it's just a review.  I don't consider myself a novice cook. but I even got some techniques and tips from it.  I think just being in the presence of Julia is a good thing. like her teaching continues even though she is still not with us.The quality of my dvd's are just fine. not sure why that other reviewer had issues with the quality.  I wish Julia had done a series of vidoes.  Now you can only get a few of the old episodes of her French Chef cooking show.  Guess they didn't think of it back then.This is a great video for beginners and I think a great price. under $11."
12,"The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it. The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult. It takes some getting used to. The image was very dark. not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem. The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this. The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together. Overall i was not happy with the game itself. I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product."
11,"So. this is a star wars game. if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game. that is pretty much it.  You roll dice. move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah. save your money and get King of Tokyo instead. if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
4,"G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen!  Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!"
6,"I have had my epson 2200 for ten years now. and it is still going strong. Yes. it uses a lot of ink. and yes. the ink is expensive. but the results are well worth it. I find it works better if it is used often.This is not a printer for the timid. However. if you are willing to spend the time learning about the color management. and calibrations. the unit delivers spectacular prints.I am particularly impressed with the print quality from this machine. I use the velvet fine art paper. and find the prints are extremely stable. and the colors do not fade or shift."
7,"In the past I've always limited my search for hose couplings to local hardware stores.  That was a mistake.  After searching Amazon and finding this highly rated product. I decided to give it a try.  Boy is this a heck of a lot better than what I've been getting.Installation is a cinch and once you have it screwed on. it isn't coming off.The threaded part of this coupling is nicely machined and screws together nicely with other attachments.  After I tried one of these. I immediately bought more and used them to replace the couplings on my other hoses."
11,"This peg toy allows my 2 year old grandsons to use new skills. They have to work hard to master putting the peg into the mat. The mat needs to be thicker which would make it easier for them and also keep the mat from warping so that the mat will lie flat. Overall. it is a great toy that could be tweaked in this way to be even better! I think they will play with this for several more years as they get better at stacking the pegs or creating designs. Great concept!"
2,"I saw all the warnings about this item not being dishwasher safe. I saw the sticker on the flat side of the mallet. Good to go. as I hand wash my dishes. After having used the thing and cleaned it right after I was done. one evening when I was tired I simply I tossed it in with the few dishes and utensils soaking in hot water. Big mistake. After that. this thing was ruined. It should have been obvious. Why would something not be dishwasher safe? The high temperatures. of course. I knew not to put it in the dishwasher. but I did not want chicken juice getting crusted on the thing and so I put it in with everything else to hand wash.Simple mistake. Cost me $15. Save yourself the trouble and try to find something that is stainless steel."
5,"Without changing my pickups or polishing my frets. I thought I'd try to get a little more sustain switching up strings. At first I thought I had got a bum buy because the I had to bring the action up a bit to account for the over brightness of the strings. Had my tone all off and I was ready to dig my other set back out of the trash..... played on it for a half hour (went through the exact same thing with the Polywebs I put on the RG655) then retuned. sounded pretty good. Played for another half hour and retuned and it actually sounds great now. Dropped the action back down and it's smooth as silk in an hour's time. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
10,"My local big box store sold me this bulb for my Porter Cable 18v Lithium Flashlight (model PCL-180FL). After about one half hour of continuous use the flashlight stopped working.  Upon opening up the lens holder I discovered the bulb had melted through the bulb holder.  Fortunately. the Porter Cable service rep took pity on me and is mailing me replacement parts so I can fix my flashlight. None the less. before buying this bulb. make sure it is truly compatible with your flashlight or you may end up destroying your flashlight.  The correct bulb for the Porter Cable 18v series of flashlights (e.g. PCL-180FL and PCL-18FL) is a KPR 18v 0.3amp krypton bulb(Porter Cable part number #90534275).Ultimately what Porter Cable/Dewalt (they are the same company) need to do is release an LED conversion kit for their flashlights."
10,"I looked at several competitive products and chose this one.  This is a very good tool.  It is easy to handle as it is light. yet powerful. and the trigger is large.  These features give you good control esp with larger screws.  I have driven up to 3 inch screws with ease.  The nosecone takes some practice to adjust. but once you figure it out. it performs very nicely.  My only complaint is that the instructions provided are kind of sparse and you end up figuring out how to use the tool by yourself.  Not a big issue. however. as the tool is very simple.Overall. very satisfied!!"
6,"I recently testedScotch Magic(TM) Tape 3105. 3/4-inch x 300 Inches. 3-Packagainst Scotch's(R) Satin Finish Gift-wrap tape.  Both were both 3/4 inches wide.You can't go wrong with either of these products!  They both came in the very familiar and proven dispensers - nothing fancy. and they just work well.I was surprised to see that the Matte Finish product was actually more invisible than the Satin Finish Gift-wrap product - but unless you saw them side by side. you'd never know.The Satin Finish Gift Wrap Tape did allow me to easily remove or reposition the tape.  Either way. find the best price. keep it simple. and use either of these tape products - you will not be disappointed!"
6,"These do. in fact. perform as advertised.  They run through my laser printer cleanly and adhere well. blocking things underneath (I tested it on a white box that had black sharpie on it; the sharpie was obscured by the label 100%).  They are a bit small for my box-shipping needs (I use the half-sheet labels for that) but for mailing correspondence to the same address every month. it's quite easy to run off the addresses on a sheet of these labels and keep them with my stamps."
11,"We got one of these games on the recommendations on Amazon.  We were not disappointed. it is fun. quick to learn. and can be played with children as well as adults.  I tried it on all of them from grand kids to married and college kids and my husband and I alone.  It was fun in every instance.  We then bought 13 games for Christmas presents for friends and families confident that it would be an addition to good times together.  Recommend it as well as Spot It. both new games we tried this year."
1,"I love Certain Dri. I'm not sure I could get along in life without it. When I first started using Certain Dri over a decade ago. I would use it every day. Then. I dropped down to using it every other day after maybe two or three weeks. Now. I feel I only need to give my underarms a few swipes once a week. This is incredible because I used to sweat like a beast. I mean. just sitting down without moving around would make my underarms sweat profusely. Gross. I don't worry about that anymore. I do wish that the product worked on hands. though. I haven't had any success trying to get it to work on my hands. However. that's not how the product is marketed. It is just wishful thinking."
9,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units. and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me. especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all. so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options. and if they weren't on sale. it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries. I cant get the things out."
4,"If you are anxious to see a Japanese monster movie about Rodan. Godzilla and Mothra having a round table discussion about whether to unite and save the world from Ghidorah. the Three-Headed Monster. this is your film. Director Ishiro Honda delivers just that.If. though. you want to see Honda's GREATEST film and one of the most  horrifying and unsettling films of the sixties you should skip the above and check out Mantango. There are no monsters here over six feet tall. Tokyo is not threatened. no buildings are crushed. no tin tanks are destroyed. no thousands of people flee in terror. there is no radioactive breath anywhere and the Japanese army is nowhere in sight.I guess this world is big enough for both."
7,"I easily get two years out of a spool of this string while cutting both grass and weeds on my 18v trimmer.  It cuts clean and level and does not shred even on the harder stuff.  On rare occasions you may just break a little of the end off but that just tears away cleanly on your next trim. so no cutting of the line is necessary.  Yes. it is cheaper to just buy the line and wind it yourself. but for roughly $4 and some change it is hardly worth your time and effort."
11,"A fun. fast and easy to learn card game with high replayability!  Every time you play Fluxx it changes.  The cards change.  The goals change.  The game can end in one play or 40 minutes later. this is what makes it so fun. or frustrating!  The Zombies are the Creepers in this version of Fluxx. and there are certain cards that can also turn your friends (Keepers) into zombies as well.  Other cards can undo that. as well as make the Goals (which most say you cannot win with Zombies) allow you to be able to win with zombies.  There are a lot of fun elements with this version and it does combine with most other Fluxxes (although not Martian. which I just purchased and found out).  I love everything Zombie so this one gets played a LOT with our various gaming groups!  Highly recommended!"
6,"The high quality of Avery products is once again found in these Easy Peel Return Address Labels for use with ink jet printers.The labels peel off easily and quickly with only a slight flexion of the carrier sheet material.  In fact. due to the design. flexion of the carrier sheet is really no longer necessary.The fast. easy peel feature is achieved by stripping off the extra surrounding waste label paper that is between the labels.  This leaves the labels as free-standing units on the carrier sheet.For anyone who has ever had to put labels on a number of letters. this saves substantial time and mess.  Other brands really have some catching up to do!"
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Y Wing adds turrets and some great other abilities to the game. A little more complex to play. but the models look great and they are loads of fun to use in-game"
2,"Probably best vaccuum I have ever owned. I only ever buy stand up vacuums but this one had great reviews and I thought. what the heck. It is really light. I hardly ever notice it trailing along behind me. and it has a really good suction! I love the long hose and different attachments. Whereas I used to just vacuum my rugs. now my cleaning routine consists of me vacuuming everything in my house. I mean everything. Lol. It goes from hardwood to carpet easily. the bags last a long time. There are 2 cons on this product in my opinion. 1) the cord does not retract. and 2) the hose is somewhat thin and occasionally kinks. It does seem the hose won't last long but I can't imagine it is much to replace."
5,"I tend to sweat when I play. so coated strings are a necessity for me.  These are as good as any coated string on the market. I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings.  Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string. These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well.  Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play!  Oh. and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them.  The guitar and the strings will last longer and thank you for it."
9,"Got it today. way quicker than I expected or was said. it's so cute. it's tiny. got it as a gift for my fathers b-day who has all mac stuff. laptop. phone and think ipod. so this goes along with his style. didn't take it out of the box so as not to finger print it up. though it is really cute and think he will like it.  Has toothpick and tweezers.  Assuming like my old faithful swiss is sharp as can be though won't find out till he gets it."
4,"Nowdays.most Americans do not know who Stalin or even Hitler was(but they know 50 cent). so this movie would confuse most in the USA. Hitler and Stalin were both Communists and were basically on the same team. Marx called for the elimination of 'Trash Races' like the Lithuanians. Poles. Britons. etc. He said those races were too backward to be revolutionary ! So much for all of you 'Useful Idiot' commies. George Bernard Shaw is on the video calling for the development of a poison that would be humane and kill rapidly ( Zyklon B). A lot of information that would not be aired in the USA as it caused a big furor in Europe.The same Blood bankers that created communism then are still running London and Washington and this movie alludes to that."
10,"I am a remodeler. I am not committed to any brand of tools. Some brands do better on one tool. and some do better on another. Overall Milwaukee is the brand I use the most. but a drywall screwgun I went with DeWalt. I have no complaints with this gun. It is fast. powerful. light. and has easy depth adjustment. I have been using it for the last year+ and havent had any problems with it.If you have drywall to do. and you dont have a drywall gun you are wasting time. It is worth the money."
12,"Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but. every level get's harder and harder it's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50% of your muscles would atrophy. also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let's make a cake for mario then it's over so don't waste your time with this game."
5,"I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadn't.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes. but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isn't a professional musician. I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics. mainly the switch could use some replacing.  I'm not complaining. I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169. you can't expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up. I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me. a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop it's tuning a little."
7,"This is very heavily built and well designed.  For a compact grill it reaches cooking temperature rapidly. and can hold 6 large burgers easily.  You can adjust the grill height to two positions. So far I've found the high position cooks best for my own style of cooking.  It's is easy to clean (set it on the grass and hose it out).  The bottom grating is showing signs of rust. so I've started using WD-40 on it after I rinse it out.  However. it is so stout that I don't know that the slight rust would cause a problem for some time."
5,"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake. to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4' stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels. and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake. and instead of buying another snake. why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup. no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4' stereo... It's high quality. and very solid. I definately expect this to last me a long time."
2,"Every chef says the best mashed potatoes are made with a ricer so I treated myself to this one.  I found the handles a little uncomfortable...silicone or rubber on them might help.  Pressing the potato through isn't as easy as chefs make it look but I found if I put the bowl in the sink and then leaned the lower handle on the sink and pressed down. it was much easier and kind of fun.The potatoes came through very fluffy but really once you add the milk and butter. they become creamy so I don't know about this 'fluffy mashed potatoes' I keep reading about.  But using the ricer is much more consistent than mashing...not a chance of lumps so they're very very smooth.  I'd definitely recommend this product."
5,"These strings are best suited for Strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone. They're also quite good on Les Paul style guitars if you like slinky strings. My issue with them is that the B string and the A string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others. I would prefer if the B string were 0.012 instead of 0.0115 and if the A were 0.032 instead of 0.034. As such. I prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way. But if you're not too picky. this will suit you very well."
5,"This Guitar Hanger is good looking. well made. and was exactly what we were looking for to hang my son's acoustic guitar on the wall in his room. Our logic was that having it hanging in plain sight would be much more conducive to him practicing over having it hidden in case stuffed in a closet. and so far that seems to be the case.The hanger was easy to install (literally took less than 5 minutes to screw into the wall) and is easy to use (just place guitar in the padded holder by the neck).Highly Recommended!CFH"
4,"The movie is very vivid and emotional. I don't like to watch violence. but I think in this case it shows exactly what our Savior went through so that we can have salvation. It adds meaning to it. It's very difficult to watch because of how awful they were to Him. but it depicts the love of God for us. thus strengthening our love for Him. He made that ultimate sacrifice for us. so now it's our turn to make our sacrifices for Him. even unto death."
9,"If it's 20lb test. SAY that it's 20lb test.  Don't do the '20/8lb' nonsense.  It means it's 20lb test with the same diameter as 'normal' 8lb test monofiliment.  What's up with that?  When did fishing become a techno-weenie adventure?Not at all what I wanted.I'm dropping the staars for a very confusing product description.  I can't use it on my reels. and can't rate it as a fishing line. but the guy I gave it to was very happy to get it for salmon fishing."
12,"Alright already. It's a great game. Good AI. graphics. Runs well. Atmospheric. Great story and dialogue. Comedy. Blah. blah. blah.Wait a minute. I got a complaint! That movie in the beginning. You can't escape  it. It just goes on and on babbling while you're stuck in a stupid tram  car. Sheesh. What a bore. That kind of nonsense will cost you a star.  Later. I went thru that ride a few times because I grew to like the eerie  understated music. Still. I think I should have been able to skip the intro  movie. Ruined the whole game for me."
6,"I ordered i think 4 70-sheet notebook spirals. and 2 100-sheet sprials from this company that sent me the wrong items from SAM'S club?? But I didnt return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls? because 1. I didnt feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2. So that i wouldn't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it's okay that my order got wrong. I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened... They are nice notebooks though. Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot (which I don't unless its a math or number involved class)I like them."
6,"I purchased 2 of these for my recent cross-country move to protect my kitchen-wares and fragile stuff (e.g. lamps. picture frames. a porcelain owl. etc.).  I did not lose any dishes. cups. bowls. and other fragile items during the move I'm sure in part thanks to the Scotch Cushion Wrap.  The perforations 12 inches help make it easy to tear proper lengths of bubble wrap and you can easily fold or stack them back up for re-use.  I have no complaints and will probably buy again for my next move."
9,"I have a saying.  'Give me your dullest knives. and I'll make them duller!'  I stink at sharpening knives.  Always have.  But since I purchased the DMT I've been able to keep all my blades in shaving sharp condition.  It does the job fast. and thats cool. because I can be impatient.  I have found that the fine side does most of the sharpening. and is adequate for most needs.  The lite. small. compactness of it makes it great for any trip where regular sharpening is required. ie. camping fishing. backpacking.  So for all you unskilled types (like me). you will be happy buying the DMT diafold sharpener."
12,"The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean. what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat. and have hardly any detail. and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns. well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking. but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking. the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal. but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10"
2,"I have heard for quite some time how wonderful Potato Ricers are. They process the Potato in one squeeze. and prevent over mixing and creating glue when using a stand mixer. I decided to see for myself if I preferred riced potatoes. The first time I used the OXO Ricer. the Potatoes came out creamy and delicious. The texture was different than whipped Potatoes. and the flavor was more &#34;natural&#34;. I didn't need to stir in as much butter or cream as I usually would when I used the stand mixer. I now use the Ricer every time I make Mashed Potatoes. and really enjoy this new method. The OXO Ricer is easy to use. easy to clean. and the padded grips prevent hand cramping if you are processing a larger batch. - Highly recommended."
7,"I bought this thing when they still had the wooden handles.  Being an avid sewer. I am quite familiar with Fiskars scissors and have many pairs that I rely on and have for many. many years.  So. when I saw these at the local garden store. it was a no brainer in my mind.  SO glad I have these!  Of ALL the tools like this I've owned over the years. this set of Loppers from Fiskars is the only set that hasn't broken. become jammed. or some other weird thing.  I clean them after each use to keep diseases spreading from plant to plant.  They're amazingly easy to use. especially for women. and boy. the clean cuts it makes just makes everything you do a breeze.  One of those items I am SO glad I found!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
9,"This is really an excellent accessory to improved dumbbell training at Home. or you can even bring then to the gym.The power hooks provides the user with a method to perform and accomplish heavier dumbbell training procedures safer and easier. resulting in maximum training benefits from your pair of dumbbells. reducing the risk of injury when handling heavy weights.Each power hook comes with a leather strap that attaches the power hook to the dumbbell bar. This way for example you can position your loaded dumbbells in the overhead barbell. lay in the bench. and grab the dumbbells that are already positioned in a convenient way to perform presses or flies without the risk of injuring yourself when to try to take the heavy dumbbells from the flour to the starting position for a dumbbell bench press or fly.I bought mines about six months ago. and I love them. They allow me to handle heavy weights safely when there no one near to help you with the weights. This is even more convenient if you train alone at home."
9,"Each year. I give these little classic knives as gifts to an assortment of people.  With the restrictions on knives on aircraft now. they are always appreciated.  Since owning and using these on a daily basis for many years. I have yet to have one break or be problematic.  I do oil the hinges every year or so at least. more when the knife is used often.  It's the most basic knife without bells and whistles and I love it.  They are offered in a wide variety of colors and patterns and usually can be found for $10 or less.  The Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife is the best in it's class and at the low cost. it's not heartbreaking when one is lost.  It's also nice to have a couple on hand in the gift box for the times when someone compliments mine -- I give it away and know that I have a replacement at home."
10,"This is an update to a review I placed here 5 years ago. These blades are still a good bargain but I just learned that they cannot be re-sharpened. I sent them to Burn's Tool sharpening service and they responded that the blades were 'disposable. and will not sharpen nicely'. BUT it took me 5 years to dull 1 1/2 sets of knives (3 edges). so I am not terribly disappointed. If anyone knows somewhere that will sharpen these knives. (at a cost less that just buying new ones). please leave comment here."
9,"I brought a pair of aqua sphere goggles and they work great. they did not fog up like the rest of the goggles do and the seal works great and stay seal so it does not leak. I have brought other pairs of goggles from speedos to tyr and they all leak and fog up even when they say its anti fog and they do not seal well around my face. I aways buy aqua spheres now and no other brands of goggles. they are also easy to ajust. I would highly recamend these goggles to anyone they are great."
1,"Shaving is about as personal thing you can do. It's not an experience you can share. It doesn't make for scintillating conversation. So. PERSONALLY. the Gillette Mach 3 is the best razor for my beard. My beard is pretty tough: to use the belabored joke. my five o'clock shadow makes its appearance around noon. And it's thick. However. the skin underneath is very sensitive. This razor gives me that 'close shave' without irritating my face. The price for the cartidges are. yes. a little high. But it's a small price to pay for a product that works. It's sort of like paying a little extra for 'bathroom tissues'. (But that's another personal thing we do alone that rarely makes for scintillating conversation.)"
11,"raved about it!  It looked like a good game for the family. so I got it for a Christmas present.  I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice. but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice.It's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game.  They went out and bought one of the other &#34;Ticket to Ride&#34; games as well.It's a keeper and definitely worth the money.  A GREAT break from TV!"
11,"My son loves to recite the No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed story.  When I bought him the book with all 5 stories I saw these to go along with it. They're cute. and he does enjoy them but they're a tad be awkward.  They're too big to really be finger puppets on an adult's hand. let alone a 3 year old's hand. They do velcro together so they can hold hands and you can make them jump.  He was excited about them. but they aren't really a favorite of his.  I probably wouldn't pay that much money for them again."
12,"What can be more fun than running around chasing monkeys? the are plenty of levels and gadgets to play with. The only downside is that the paddle boat is impossible to control in my opinion. Each monkey has its own charateristics and weapons. just trying to run up and snag the monkey doesn't always work. special gadgets must be used first. Pretty much run around the world getting rid of monkeys using gadgets. The game is pretty explanatory but is loads of platform fun. also includes minigames that can kill some time with friends."
2,"I received this item for Christmas.  I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.  I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk. condesed milk. and cocoa powder.  At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.  It didn't swish when I shook it. so I thought I was good to go.  After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.  I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.  After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.  I will never buy ice cream from the store again.  This ice cream maker is awesome. I love it."
12,"This game actually stands up to the test of time. as opposed to Myst part one's antiquated technology. and ancient graphics...Unfortunately. I never got to play these games when they came first came out. and being spoiled with all the improvements in the visual department over the years. had to start with Riven instead of Myst. The game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all 5 games. simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future under-developed. but beautiful lands Myst would take us to..Obviously this game is for a certain type of 'quiet' gamer. who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral. button mashing action..If those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however. there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary Myst series.."
7,"I've used this product in the past and am still using it in a concentrated formulation because it is cost effective. I live near a wooded area that is inhabited by deer and other creatures. I also have a couple of resident rabbits in the yard. This does an effective job of keeping the critters away from my flowers and succulents. It is easy to use and has a big plugin that you don't have to mix it. Spray the plants as directed and forget it. The only negative is that normally given the amount of rainfall we experience. this does not last for 3 months. I spray about every  6 weeks. Doing this diligently duing the growth season seems to keep animals away. The deer have stopped feeding on the hostas. plumeria. etc.This size is great for an average yard and should last for at least one season."
1,"I like this brush. though I do wish it had a suction cup. or something. so it would be easier to be near the sink.  We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job. though. even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand. and while it was nice. the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.  For the price these are easy to replace when necessary."
9,"Bronner's doesn't have tooth-coating ingredients found in even 'healthy'  commercial toothpastes. But you say you -want- those? Actually cleaning teeth instead of supposedly protecting them allows your natural processes to rebuild enamel. There is still so much not known about all of the weird ingrediants in just about every other product. Perhaps the strange new feeling isn't 'nice'? You'll get used to it. and learn to love it. I use peppermint. as toothsoap and mouthwash.  and have found that it gives me a clean feeling no other product does. Perhaps what others find undesireable about Dr Bronner's is exactly what they really need.  I believe that it may be able to stop a cold before it starts. cleaning out germs and mucus in the mouth and throat in early stages of a possible cold. Some  interpret this as an uncomfortable sensation.  (it involves quite bit of spitting afterwards if the mucus is there). I've found no other product cleans as well clean"
7,"This saw is awesome. Took it out for it's first use today. Great power on demand at the push of a button. no worries about gas or oil. just the lube the chain and you're good to go. Sliced through moist maple like butter. Handled branches up to 8' with ease. It did. however. throw its chain after an hour of use. which was entirely my fault; do what you're supposed to. and adjust the tension are the new chain has warmed up (and therefore expanded!) a bit. A great. versatile tool!"
9,"I bought a 32oz peppermint one based on Backpacker Magazine's recommendation.  The 4oz bottle in REI sold for close to $5 therefore the 32oz here for $15 is a super bargain!.I chose peppermint so that I can use it as face/body/laundry/dish liquid and tooth brushing.  A tiny little bit is MORE THAN ENOUGH to wash the face and neck.  For you superlight backpackers. this is a must have for the functionality. weight to use ratio. and biodegradability.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
5,"Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb.  This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types. it's a great capo and very durable in construction and material.  Like a good guitar that is well cared for. this is something that's great to hand down to the next generation.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you. it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews. and leave a comment if you have any questions. I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help."
2,"Like many of the &quot;Good Grips&quot; products. it's really astounding how much better this peeler is than &quot;traditional&quot; peelers (you know. the all-metal. slightly rusty thing that had been in your utensil drawer since you bought at at the supermarket when you were stocking the kitchen for your first apartment).  This inexpensive gadget produces much better results. much faster and more comfortably. than any other peeler I've ever used.  It works equally well on potatos. carrots. apples. etc.  It's cheap ($5-$6 for an essential kitchen tool you'll own for years) and works great; why in the world wouldn't you buy it?  If you cook and you don't own one. stop reading and buy one now.  It's a no-brainer."
10,"Mostly a repeat of others. so bottom-line: BUY THIS. and you won't have to buy another (unless it's stolen. like mine).I bought mine YEARS ago. and it was just stolen. so I'll be buying another one....not even going to shop around for another brand/ model!!  Plenty of power (use the removable side handle. and keep a good stance when doing high torque applications where the bit can grab).  Very rugged construction.  Comfortable grip and control (although not at the lowest end...but I don't use it for those applications anyway).  The removable cord and easy access to replace the motor brushes are nice touches. The handle threading into both the left and right-hand sides makes it easy to share with left-handers at the jobsite.What else can I say...."
9,"Hey guys. I camp and hunt a lot with many friends. My job is to cook for hungery people and the stove has worked great for that.  I use the fitting for re-filling the little 1pound tanks. off bulk tanks.  1LB will last a long time. many cooks.  I took one star away becasue some of the sheet metel is getting cought in the lid. so when I try to open it. I need to find something to pry it open. The second thing is it can be hard to turn the burner on low. it junps back to middle heat when I take my hand off the knob. but it will do it. I just have to try several times.  All in all a great stove! I'd buy it again!!!"
1,"Seems to be a legit 3X.  I bought my first and everything perfect.  So I bought a 2nd for my nephew - but that one had the light issue someone else mentioned (really dim. flickering).  Before I sent it back. I wanted to check the batteries - so I unscrewed where they are. took them out. but it looked like the contact on the right battery on the unit(uses 2 small watch-like ones) had some kind of grime on it - wiped that off. and I also bent the little tab to stick out a little more to give it a better contact on the battery - did that for the other side as well (it's different because of the +/- but you can bend both sides out a little).  After that. put the batteries back in and it works like my good one."
7,"First of all this does what it is supposed to and in that it is a fine product.However.Took me awhile to figure out how to get it to work (directions not so clear and not 100% self explanatory)The screws and slides allow for probably most desk rail widths.  But the tricky part is that there is a support on the pot which requires that it be braced against a post or a baluster/picket.  My deck railing has a very old style (and no longer code) style 'X' between posts.  This left very little spacing options for where the pot could be placed.  From below it looks lovely but a direct look at it the two anchors to the railing don't looks so neat (tempted to place a pot on top of them to hide them)."
9,"I can not say enough about the quality of Victorinox knifes.  Owned Spartan since November of 1978.They have never disappointed me except once when I drop my Explorer and the scale cracked.They would no longer send you a replacement scale you had to mail the knife in.I had a similar problem in 1988 and they just mailed me the scale and a new spring for my mini-scissors after we talked on the phone.If you need a tougher knife just get the Silver Alox type. limited styles no toothpick or tweezers but they are great."
10,"its simple and works well. the tube holding up the light has trouble handling the weight of CFL bulbs. It does not stay where you put it and sags. Thanks nancy for getting rid of old filament light bulbs. It is great having toxic mercury bulbs in work shops where they get broken alot. It really isnt safe putting CFL bulbs in this product due to mercury poisoning. I have not found an LED that fits the narrow opening yet. The bulb weight is an issue for the tube holding the light fixture. My old filament bulbs have no trouble but you cant get high watt bulbs anymore.I recommend DEWALT stiffen up this product given CFL type bulbs will only be availlable in the future. It simply cant handle the weight of the CFL bulbs."
5,"Forget all the volume drop comments.  There isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit.  I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals. They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in.  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads. and of course 'Born On The Bayou'.  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it.  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on. I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it."
10,"Easy to grip and handle.  Low on vibration and noise.  Lets you get right up next to areas you don't want sanded with full sanding capability to the very edge.  Beats anything I've owned so far for controllability and ability to get in tight corners and edge sand on fine work.The ONLY complaint I've got is with the dust collection system.  The bag tends to jump off on anything you're doing that isn't flat and horizontal.  And a vacuum attachment would be greatly appreciated. too.But. I'd buy it again. even with that shortcoming."
11,"The At the Zoo Jumbo puzzle is very cute.  The colors are lovely and the art is whimsical and fun.  The puzzle is nice and large.  It was fun for the kids to put together.  I was slightly disappointed in the quality.  We had recently put together a Ravensberg puzzle and this puzzle does not compare.  The pieces did not feel thick or smooth like the Ravensberg puzzle.  The sides of the pieces weren't as rounded.  I liked the box and it makes it easy to put this puzzle away.  Overall this is pretty puzzle that is lots of fun."
7,"On the product label it says this pot holder is 'for decks. balconies and fences'.  The planter has U shaped brackets that are designed to slip over a flat 2x4 or 4x4 or 2x6 railing. but this design doesn't work on a privacy fence.  My fence has no top mounted 2x4 so there is no place to hook the bracket.  I even tried screwing the brackets into the fence's 4x4 post. but the pot's brackets are 4 1/2' apart so that didn't work either.In the end I just hung the pot on the wooden support of glider/swing that I have on the patio.  Not exactly where I wanted the pot holder. but an okay place I guess."
4,"Cooking was a haphazard skill for me until I read Julia Child's 'The Way to Cook.' There are thousands of books that teach recipes. but very few about techniques. That is where Mrs. Child breaks from most cooking instructors and where she leaves an important mark.By explaining. quickly and simply. the most useful methods in the preparations of foods. she makes clear. with positive attitude. enthusiasm and reassurance. how the novice cook can prepare meals expertly.The accompanying video series. now on DVD. does not have all the recipes listed in the book (that would take years to go through). but the techniques are all here. well organized and easy to master. I recommend both these videos and the book itself. for the latter goes into deeper details on how the theme-and-variation approach to recipes helps demystify cooking.Julia Child made a significant difference in my life. I am forever grateful to America's First Lady of Food for patiently teaching me the way to cook."
10,"I'm sure there are jigsaws out there that are just as good as this one. but I don't think that any are better.  The barrel grip really aids in doing fine work.  Dust is blown away easily.  Just humms through wood.  Some comments have been made about the awkward blade change:  I can't for the life of me figure out why this is difficult to perform.  I found it very intuitive and straightforward to change blades. Bought the 30 piece Bosch blade set--excellent value.  If you read my other reviews you will see that I own a number of Bosch tools.  They are consistently excellent.  Would buy this one again."
6,"These labels are exactly what they say they are- truly blocking. We use them within our elementary school reading program. Finally. we have labels that allow for reuse of pocket portfolios without compromising the identity of its previous owner. Besides. no one wants to use a folder that has the shadow of a name behind your own!  These labels look good. save us money and time. At home. we use them when reusing shipping envelopes and boxes. My co-workers. husband. and students love them and you will too!"
6,"I have used it in my HP1022 laser printer and my wife uses it in her Brother laser printer and it always delivers clean. clear printouts. even on side 2.Update 7/7/2014:After using this paper in my HP Laserjet 1022 printer to print documents on 2 sides of the paper. discovered that the heat produced a VERY strong curl on the ends of the paper on the first side printed and it made it extremely difficult to feed the paper back into the printer and get reliable feeding for side 2. Absolutely ruined a 2nd side printing of a 100 page document. Took 2 stars off of the original rating for this problem and don't think that I'll purchase this paper again."
9,"Dr. Bronner's soap is truly the best: it's all-natural. mainly organic. all vegan. handmade. and comes from an ethical* company. Although it might seem pricy for the amount of soap you get. remember that's its highly condensed. so a little goes a long way. It's a wonderful sensation of plant blends and I love the clean crisp fragrance of citrus. I mix this with essential oils to make a shampoo/soap that works best for my skin and hair type. It's amazing what ailments plant-derived materials can relieve!*The company uses Fair Trade ingredients and caps the highest-paid employee's pay at seven times that of the lowest-paid employee."
4,"Passion of the Christ is the most controversial film of the year.  It focusses on the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ and nothing can quite prepare you for the amount of gore shown.  It is apparently 100% factual. but do we really need to be shown so much torture on screen - it simply went on and on and on.  It was so graphic that we all had to keep looking away.  There is more blood than you will ever see in a horror film.  But it doesn't end there.  Whiel carrying the crucifix. we are subjected to the beatings that Jesus received along the way.  There is a difference between implying it. and showing it.  I just felt that Mel Gibson went for the shock angle. and subjected us all to far too much gore.  Factual or not. there is no need for so much gore on a screen.  This is not how Jesus would want to be remembered."
7,"I originally chose a more expensive knee pad. ignoring these because of the single strap. However. when the ones  I ordered didn't work right. I came back to these. The other Fiskars products I have purchased have been very nice.When I first put them on I fastened the strap across the crease behind my knee and it cut into me. Immediate pain. However. I found it easy to adjust the strap below my knee (which actually pulls the cup into place better) and even crawling around. the straps stayed away from that painful spot.I will be using these for both gardening and crawling on cement under our home to replace the filter on the heater. so I am extra pleased with the waterproof nature of them.  They fit me nicely. and once I adjusted the strap. very comfortably. The cup shape keeps them from slipping to the side."
6,"Whenever I have a study group at my house. it drives me bonkers to have to demonstrate everything on a piece of paper. This easel style whiteboard is stupid easy to set up. It comes assembled already. All you do is adjust the height to where you want it. and tighten the knobs so it stays put. Then. it stays exactly where you put it until you're ready to adjust it again. You can write on both sides. Both top and bottom have the little marker holding tray on it. The legs spread out so that the easel stays nice and stable on the ground. This makes life so much easier to study. because everything is right there."
5,"First. I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them. they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band. and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable. and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself. but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable 'plinking' sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music. this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics. because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So. too bad.  I think these are great picks. but I'd like them to be made of a softer material."
11,"This is a very well made little puzzle.  The word 'Jumbo' in the product title refers to the size of the puzzle pieces - not to the size of the puzzle - and the pieces are very well sized for little hands.  The illustration is bright. beautiful. and has lots of great (and funny) little details that my daughter enjoyed finding.As for the pieces. they also seem to be very durable.  They fit together well and seem like they'll take a lot of four-year-old abuse - they can stand up to my daughter's favorite game of dancing on her puzzles after completing them.Her only complaint was the size of the puzzle.  Although the size is clearly noted in the product description. the puzzle is much smaller than the other puzzles we have.All in all. a lovely puzzle that we'll enjoy over and over again."
11,"Winner of several gaming award nominations. Village is a nice. solid worker placement strategy game that has two of the most entertaining. quirky mechanics I've seen in a while. First. a player's workers rarely move after they are placed onto the board. however time is a resource in the game and as a player accumulates time their oldest workers 'die off'. Second. players select actions by picking up goods cubes. but some goods cubes are actually time markers which give no benefit but age one's workers. While workers on the board give some benefit. family members can earn points from beyond the grave as the player with the most dead workers of each type earns bonus points at game end. The heart of the game is still to produce items and earn points at various locations on the board but I have found that managing the 'death rate' of my poor family members in the Village adds an entertaining level to an already fine worker placement game."
5,"If you expect to get what you pay for. prepare to be disappointed. Sounds weak. Sounds old. Sounds worn. Sounds dull. I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster. I can afford to pay twice as much. But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on. I am so disappointed. These strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling. tapping. pull offs. or sweepers. If you are a tone fanatic keep looking. If your guitar deserves the best. do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. Respect your GUITAR.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are made from China."
5,"This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company.  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other.  He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks. which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing. both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating. cleaning and coating effect on the components.  Wow!  And no. Andy does not own stock in. have affiliation with. or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit.  Nor do I."
10,"I ordered this stabilizer to mount on my DeWalt dw746 tablesaw.  I had been using a DeWalt 5' stabilizer plate with a Forrest WWII thin kerf blade.  At 5' in diameter. the DeWalt stabilizer effectively limited my depth of cut to about 2.5'.  After trying out the Freud 3.5' stabilizer. I can honestly say that I didn't lose any noticeable performance. and I gained enough blade clearance to once again rip/crosscut 3' stock.As an added bonus for the price. this product comes as a pair of stabilizers!  I only mounted one stabilizer on my saw (on the nut side of the blade). and was able to mount the other to my radial arm saw and greatly improve its cuts as well.I highly recommend this set of stabilizers as a good product at a great price."
12,"The very first 3D Mortal Kombat offers great graphics. new 3D worlds. the return of several fighters. tournaments. 2 on 2 kombat and much more. Scorpion. Goro. Reptile and others return to the game with a few new fighters. however the bad part is that all of the new characters have similar powers as the old characters that were not in the game. Another bad part is that unlike the past few Mortal Kombat games is that this game is very quick to beat and it lacks challenge. To make up for it though. there are the most awesome fatalities of any game. such as Scorpion's very realistic fire. the spinal removal from Sub Zero with a total 3D effect and Liu Kang's throwing his opponent straight toward the camera. Each fighter now has weapons as well to add flavor to the fight."
5,"These strings are okay. but nothing special except for the price. which is a factor when changing twice a week. I don't play enough to need changes that often anymore.So I've become more particular about trying to match the string to the guitar. This doesn't mean that these strings are bad. it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because they're darker and Brand Y Steels on another because they're brighter and Brand Z on yet another.So give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least. if you want your instrument in top shape. A bad guitar can make a great artist sound only good."
1,"Great bottle brush for our household with three kids who all play sports.  So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time. so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again. but I wish it lasted a bit longer!"
9,"I purchased 3 of these before a 4 day camping trip in North Idaho. I've always been on the lookout for alternatives to the traditional large blow up air mattresses that most people use while camping. which I have always found uncomfortable. unreliable. and a pain In the ass. These little mattresses worked great. The wife and kids loved them. They slept comfortably for 4 nights. The mattresses did not go flat or lose air. For the price. I would totally recommend these for camping. The only gripe I have is that they take awhile to inflate. Make sure you have a pump. because blowing these up with lung power could be a big chore.If you're thinking about buying this for backpacking. don't bother. They are bulky and heavy when deflated."
12,"I was really eager to see this installment in the Castlevania series. Mainly because of it's venture into 3-D. Well. I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. They were able to pull off a pretty decent game and that. in itself. makes it another great effort from Konami. It really reminded me alot of the older Castlevania games. yet in 3-D. Despite others mixed feelings on the game. I really enjoyed it. My only gripe. however. is that it was hard and frustrating at times with its' platform areas in levels. Once I made it pass those parts. it was great. One. in my opinion. that was worthy of my hard earned dollar. Although I love the 2-D Castlevania games a great deal. I do hope they make another game like this one in the future."
10,"If you are in the business.  then you know what a pain it is to set up your dewalt miter saw for punching out apartmenst or any area for second trim (shoe molding or scribe molding). This tool is the one for that job.  I have owned three of them.  of course it will not do what a top grade miter saw will do.  but it is not suppose to. it also works great for thresholds and for trimming doors for flooring.  i am in the fire and water restoration business and i believe you will find this tool very helpful."
4,"This movie takes the rather sanitized version of Jesus' crucificion and brings home the fact that the reality was far more brutal than any of us could imagine. Understanding what Jesus endured so that the rest of us could be saved is by far the most important aspect of christianity. People who just don't 'get' this movie are people who have no belief in the christian faith - I am not criticizing them. I am just suggesting that they may not truly understand the impact of this movie.There has been alot of criticism levelled that this movie is anti-semetic. It is not. It is telling the story as it was. If someone walks away from this movie with anger. then they have obviously not understood the message."
2,"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles. I'm going to send this item back and buy another eight quart pressure cooker by Presto. I can't seem to find any smaller sized pressure cookers that have a quick release option. If anyone does. please let me know by leaving a comment or messaging me."
7,"This is a good quality water hose that is safe to drink from.I keep a bowl of water outside my workshop door so the dogs can drink whilst they are out with me. I was always wary that water sat in the regular garden hose could have leeched chemicals. and I would be tainting the water of my four legged friends. I now use this hose instead.  Piece of mind. for just a few bucks.Some reviewers appear to have been shipped hoses without the rubber washer. If you dont use a washer. then it will leak. Mine came with the washer and does not leak. The washers wear out over time and need replacing. I keep these on hand:Gilmour 01RW Rubber Hose Washers"
4,"I bought this video at the same time as I bought &quot;Do the Alphabet&quot; and now my two-year old nephew won't watch it.  He only asks for &quot;Bic Birt&quot; (Big Bird is on the box of &quot;Alphabet&quot;).  I've tried sneaking it into the VCR when he isn't watching in hopes he'll  get hooked. but he always asks plaintively for the other one.  Personally.  I think that they count a little fast for him while the  &quot;Alphabet&quot; tape goes pretty slow.  And Baby Bear is always a  winner.  I think though that he will appreciate when he gets a little  older."
6,"I have always HATED 'invisible' tape -- I find that it tears apart too easily when you're trying to get it off the roll.  But transparent tape doesn't always look good on wrapping paper...This is the first time that I've tried 'gift wrap tape.' and I LOVE it!  Looks great. but without the annoying tearing issues of invisible tape.  It is now a staple in my wrapping paper drawer!The only thing I'd change is...put more on each roll!  :-)"
4,"This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but. if there weren't. the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that. even though this is a family story. there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting. really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing. you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!"
12,"Resident Evil: Director's Cut.  The Best Classic Survival Game ever. The Granddaddy of Survival Horror.  This simple put is the Game ever the one that started it all in Survival Horror.The bit of Acting is a bit cheesey but once you get past that.  you  in a Mansion full of  Zombies .Muntant Dogs. Lickers. snakes and mutant plants around every corner as you explore the Mansion and solve puzzles. it has some scary tone and music in the back ground and if your not fighting  for your life your running from things as you try and solve the mystery of your missing team and the dissapperance of the first team  that you came in search for.I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves Zombies and into survival horror."
6,"I dislike wrapping Christmas gifts.  I am horrible at it and if the present doesn't come out with a big ball of paper around it. then it is a major triumph of my soul.  This tape is thick enough to help me calm my wrapping paper beast.  And it holds down velvet ribbon when I don't have enough of it to go all the way around the box and have to tape it piecemeal around the bottom.  It's invisible and matte. so it makes my oddball wrapping look put together.  A wonderful thing.  Five stars."
9,"I love this soap.  I have used it to wash the dog because it doesn't have a bunch of chemical junk in it (and he liked it).  I use it to wash my hair.  I use it as a body wash.  I am sure it could be used for other things. but those are my three main uses. and I love it for those.I enjoy the minty feeling all over. however. if you are using it below the waist. you should use it lightly and be prepared to rinse it immedietly in case the minty feeling starts to become too much.  I have never had any problems other than feeling like a big peppermint but others may react differently.One thing you should be mindful of is that this stuff could gradually slow rate of water drainage in the drains of the bathroom--it gradually builds up a little. even inside the bottle itself.  It is easily remedied with a home made or commercial drain unclogger."
11,"Be sure to brush up on your Monty Python before you play this version of the Fluxx card game! It would really help to watch at least one Monty Python movie first. as there may be a couple of times you'll have to sing a song or recite lines of dialogue. And if you or ANY of your fellow players don't know anything about Monty Python. forget it. Simply choose another version of Fluxx. because playing Fluxx is supposed to be fun for everybody. Note that this Fluxx version is for a slightly older age range and will likely take a bit longer than other versions just because of the Monty Python aspects and the inevitable arguments that will take place as to whether 'Ni!' is actually a line of dialogue. ;-)"
4,"I'd like to give this movie a dozen stars. While I can not say I enjoyed it as entertainment. I've never seen a more powerful movie. GOD LOVES ME. screams from every second of film. It left me wishing I was less of a sinner. so that maybe just one less lash might have fallen. There is violence. but the love that made the violence necessary offsets it. It's life changing. I hate violence. I hate subtitles. as a protestant. I didn't get the Marian symbols. but I loved this movie. I prefer vhs to dvd. but this is one I want to dvd to get every bit of everything about the movie. Don't read the da vinci code. watch this movie. That's what Christ is about. not some half witted attempt to make Him less of who He is."
6,"Yes. this tape does look great when wrapping presents. Yes. it disappears on gift wrapped surfaces. But that's not all. I use it for my 'everyday' tape as well - great for small repairs when you need the tape to not leave a strange matte spot on the surface like 'regular' tape. Did your kids rip yet ANOTHER page in their storybook? Scotch BiftWrap tape. Did you forget to put something in that pretty mailing envelope? Carefully unseal it. and then...Scotch GiftWrap tape. Crafts. scrapbooking. kids' projects? Scotch GiftWrap tape. I only wish that more tape came on the rolls."
5,"I read good reviews about these strings on mylespaul.com and around the web and bought a set locally for the same price. I usually use DR Tite Fits. but these made me change for good They have a lot of mids and bass and make for a great chunky blues and classic rock sound with P90's. I also used a set on a single coil stray cigar box guitar I built and they give a lot of resonance and life to the old box and cheapo pickup. I will buy another set. DR strings never disappoint."
5,"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables. and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g.. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell. and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them. and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies. so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all."
10,"The photograph is misleading because it looks like a flimsy. toothpicky kind of support. Actually it is a very well made. heavy support worthy of the DeWalt table saw for which it was designed. I use it for supporting long boards and relatively heavy sheets of three-quarter inch plywood. I've owned my DW744XRS table saw for a couple of years. and all this time I've used 'horses' for my outfeed and side supports. Talk about an 'I-coulda-had-a-V-8' moment. when I first discovered the ease and efficiency of this invaluable accessory I was awestruck. If you own a DW744. these supports should be your next purchase."
10,"I used to use a Bosch in a cabinet shop that I loved using.Since I have a lot of Porter-cable tools so when PC came out with this I thought it was going to be more like a gray version of the Bosch I loved with improvements. Since everyone is in competition with each other it must be so.When I had to change my first blade I was in horror. I think I have it down now but boy is it still a royal pain. I dread blade changes but I'm getting better at it. Maybe my fingers are just getting increadibly strong.It has a lot of power and looks great.Dust blower. nice feature. blows dust directly in front of the line you're trying to cut on.If I have to start using this more I might sell it on ebay and get a new Bosch."
11,"Got for son for x-mas. just turned 7.  He has always been thrilled with trains. and loves board games.  Opened up on X-mas. was so surprised when he seen all the contents. and mapping.  3 days after the shock of the Wii wore off we started playing during his winter break.  Now play at least once a week.  He is getting better with the strategy of the game and point scoring.  Can play in a short period of time. moves along fast once you learn how to play.  It is a little more expensive then average board game. feel that is well worth it."
9,"I bought my first Spartan in 1979.  I have been using it since then and love it.  I also gave some as gifts to my brother and to friends.  Not a single complaint.  What I like most about it is that it has all the essentials - can opener. bottle opener. cork screw and screwdrivers.  The tweezers and toothpick make it even more complete.  It is not a multi-tool. but it is a compact. everyday handy tool. without frills.I finally had to buy a replacement because my daughter wanted one to go camping - except for a few scratches it looks as good as new and works like new.I Highly recommend it."
11,"This game is what helped me pull my 12 & 13yo sons away from the XBOX and play board games with me on a regular basis.  Having liked Skyrim on the XBOX. they understood the theme immediately and really wanted to do the campaign style playing.  Though is can be played not as a campaign. I am not really sure why you wouldn't.  I play the Overlord. We have just about finished &#34;Act 1&#34;.  I have won about 75% of the time. but they still enjoy it and I have too. Not too easy. not too hard. though some scenarios do really seem to favor one side over the other.  I suspect we will keep playing in this until done and then buy the expansions."
12,"In comparison to other N64 games. this piece is a worthwhile buy.  The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring. pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However. it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.  Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder. and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day.  So buy this game and spin in circles to your heart's content."
4,"I got this video knowing nothing about Dr. Ben Carson except what was written in Amazon's product description.  I like medical history dramas & I lkie Cuba Gooding Jr.  Previously. he starred with Rober DeNiro in 'Men of Honor'. another true life story of a real person.  He did a fantastic job in that other role. playing Carl Brashear. a Master Chief Petty Officer/diver & the first black diver in US Navy history.  Cuba did just as fine a job portraying Dr. Ben Carson. a renown neurosurgeon.  I watched this movie three times before writing this review.  I LOVED IT!  I also enjoy watching the special features & there was an interview with the real Ben Carson & with Cuba Gooding.  The directors have taken pains to make Cuba look as much like Ben as possible.  I'm glad I got it & sorr that three people thought it was a documentary - It is not - it is a movie."
9,"Another poster mentioned only a 1 year warranty but the box (purchased on Amazon) has a sticker that says 3 years and the warranty card in the box confirmed it. I've been using a good pair of zoom binoculars for watching boats and they are fine if I have a tripod. This Canon Image Stabilization (IS) 10x30 solves the problem beautifully. They are far more useful than standard binoculars because you can concentrate on the details of whatever you're watching without straining to hold them steady. They are very comfortable to hold as they are compact and light weight. Everybody who tries them breaks into a big smile when they press the IS button!"
1,"I have chronic anemia and am periodically on oxygen. and have developed nearly daily nosebleeds. My hematologist gave me a sample of Ayr because I was in so much pain from the cracking and irritation. I could hardly touch my nose. After a few days using it. my nostrils were actually *flexible* without being too painful again! I still get nosebleeds but if I keep up with using the Ayr as needed. I don't have the burning dryness. it doesn't hurt to touch the sides of my nose and I can blow my nose (believe me. that's an achievement).I purchased theAyr Saline Nasal Gel Moisturizing Swabs With Soothing Aloe. 20-Count Swabsto tuck in my purse when I'm out. since this is Wisconsin and it's drier than a bone here in the winter.This is better than the entire pile of saline-only mists. treatments and sprays I've been advised to use."
5,"I got these for a parts-tele I built and I'm really happy with them.  Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger.  But they look great. work great. stay in tune and are completely vintage spec.  I have a '57 reissue strat and I can't tell the difference.  One thing I've always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat."
4,"I wish CTV would consider reissuing 'Sesame Street' as a chronological series. starting with 'Season One.' and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast. not with a few select bits chopped up into the new. modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful. whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway. that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay. Ernie!"
1,"In the past our ENT recommended we use Ayr Saline Nasal Gel.  Our ENT said the Ayr gel would keep our noses from getting overly dry.  He said this would help prevent us from getting so many sinus infections.  He also suggested we each use a Neti Pot and saline solution.  As the doctor pointed out. you can keep Ayr gel with you at all times. but you cannot always keep a Neti Pot with you.I don't know why. but we sneeze almost each time we apply the Ayr gel.  The sneezing last for a few seconds and then the sneezing stops.  The Ayr gel moisturizes our nasal cavities. which helps us to have fewer nosebleeds.Amazon and Wal Mart charge the same price for the Ayr gel. but when we go to Wal Mart. they are often out of stock.  I was glad to find it here at Amazon.  When I bought it from Amazon. Amazon had temporarily lowered their price."
5,"The winder works well for me. and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips). but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  Also. the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy. and doesn't work well for reluctant pins.  I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more. but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter. so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon."
10,"I have too have purchased the 1000 biscuit assortment. For the money it's a fairly good buy.  Yes. I have encountered biscuits that are thicker due to moister absorption. Even keeping them in sealed plastic bags will only delay the swelling. and this is a limitation of the material.  There is a solution. purchase a 'Biscuit Press'.  Tom Foster designed and sells a tool for this very purpose. It allows you to squeeze the thicker biscuits back to a thinner dimension before insertion. and they fit just fine.  For more information see Link: [...]After I started using the Biscuit press to compress biscuits to a consistent size just before use I haven't had any problems with too thick biscuits.  If you use a lot of biscuits. this tool is a must.  This step will eliminate the biggest limitation of this biscuit problems."
4,"I was pleased to see this video when it first came out and I recommend it very much. I watched it with my sons. who were born in 1965 and 1966. all the years they were growing up.  They are now fine parents themselves.  I  believe it expresses very well the true meaning of Christ-mas. The review  from T. Liptak says it very well.  It puts Christ back into Christmas where  He belongs.  It was and still is one of very few videos that tell what  Christmas is about - the greatest gift of all to a sad and needy world -  the gift of Christ. that's why we celebrate Christ-mas."
7,"We have coyote fences in my neck of the wood which are Latilla wood rods wrapped around an iron post. It's not always easy to find something which will hang easily on the inside of the fence. which is why I was interested to see this planter design. I find it works perfectly although it may be just a tad too flimsy for anything with a substantial weight. That being said. I think it will hold up lighter plants with no problems whatsoever.It looks well built and the adjustable part screwed together nicely. The other nice part about this is that you can move it wherever the sun is and then move it back to a shady place to rest for a while. It's a nice idea and I will recommend it to my neighbors who are always trying to figure out gadgets so they can hang flowers on their coyote fences."
6,"In this yet another superior product from Avery. these laser shipping labels can be accommodated to any size envelope as they are not too big and not too small. so as to  seem not aesthetically fitting.Their actual size is 2' x 4'. guaranteed to be jam free and smudge free (haven't tested this claim extensively yet as I have just begun to use them.  So far they work out fine and my printer likes them).I've often bought small labels for small envelopes. and larger for bigger ones.  Now I don't have to do that anymore. slightly uncomplicating my life.  And that's welcome!These labels also cover any printing underneath should one want to send something out in a used enveloped.  That's a pennysaver!Thanks. Avery. for another fine product."
12,"I can't say anything about DOOM that has already been said only complainant is due to the fact that it's on a console it had to cut out levels & parts of levels out. It's of course a FPS it basically made the 1st person shooters popular cause like every other game now is a d@*&ntilde; FPS. But in DOOM you have to solve puzzles find key cards it just wasn't about running & gunning. It's got a simple but effective story in space scientist are experimenting with portals the Demons from h** come through & all h** breaks loose. eventually the Demons come to Earth & you have to stop the invasion. I can't do the game justice but yes if you never have played DOOM it's a great game & you go to war with your 9MM shotgun double barrel shotgun rotary cannon rocket launcher plasma rifle & the Big F**ing Gun!"
9,"Solidly made and easy to use.  The process for picking a combo is straight forward and it will fit on everything from my .22 pistol to my 12 GA shotgun.  The tumblers are smooth and feel solid in the housing for the price you can't beat this little lock to keep any unwanted hands off your trigger.  I take mine out when we go to the range to keep kids and moron's from shotting each other while I'm shooting or working with another shooter and don't have eyes on my weapons.  Plus with the combo you don't have to worry about forgetting/not finding keys when you need them."
10,"This sander really does work fine. it does the job it is designed to do. I do have a couple of complaints though. Firstly the dust bag is basically useless. Mine has broken twice and when it is in place it is largely ineffective. ( Actually though. I fail to see how a ssnder's dust bag can work without a vacuum. but anyway)  and the other gripe is the power switch. Mine is in a dust protective booted cover. that I usually fail to properly toggle. so when I start to sand. it will turn off - or the worse case it turns back on when I am setting it down.  I can say however. that this unit has held up through the years that I have owned it. dropped it. loaned it . . . So I have no question as to its durability.  I cannot base it on any comparisons with other RO sanders. but I can say I have got my moneys worth over and over."
9,"I have used this griddle on the stove. in the oven. and on the grill.  The seasoning it came with was adequate enough for me to get started cooking right away.  I am a novice at cast iron cooking but have been studying up on the best techniques to try and avoid some of the horror stories of other first time users.  The first items I cooked were some hamburgers and had no problem with sticking.  After several more meals (one including a couple of strips of bacon) I attempted an egg.  I had no problem with the egg sticking and as always cleanup was a breeze.  As long as you take proper care of this griddle I see no reason why it shouldn't last a life time with little to no sticking.  On a side note. my wife has said that I have made the best tasting hamburgers and steaks while using this griddle."
7,"I made the huge mistake of buying a cheap $2 trowel from my local HD. of course. it literally snapped at the handle while doing some light digging.The Fiskars trowel on the other hand. is built to last. I couldn't really tell from the pictures. but once I inspected and held it. I could feel the quality and after testing it. I noticed a huge difference. the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig. is simply great.What I like the most is the design. the handle is a  solid metal piece. thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last."
12,"Golden Eye 007 is still one of the best action titles ever created. along with the best licensed product ever released. The action is still superb and well-polished even since its release 10 years ago. The enemies are still smart. even with competitors like F.E.A.R. which have incredibly intelligent artificial intellignce. There are a couple of issues unfortunately; some targeting problems and odd save layouts. Other than those. this game is still one of the best shooters ever made. The missions are excellent. the enemies are cool. the weapons are cool. and virtually everything else about this game is superb and well-executed. Too bad Nintendo handed the rights of James Bond to EA."
2,"my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis. and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker. well... just hilarious.  I have no such entertaining stories. just dozens of great meals cooked quickly and well in a cooker that goes directly into the dishwasher. no fuss. no muss.  Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.  This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel. putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.  And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood."
11,"My wife and I are starting to get into more advanced board games as we age. We have always loved games such as monopoly. clue and other such games. We decided that we wanted to spread our wings and try a little more complex game. This was a fantastic choice! When I say it is advanced it is by no means hard to play. It has smooth gameplay that I believe all ages could learn. The entire game revolves around your decisions as governor which buildings you will build to ward off invading armies. This leads to the decision of prestigue building or defense. Everyone in our family loves this game and it has given us hours of enjoyment!"
7,"I have been doing yard work for 40 years. so I am no 'backyard rookie'.  This pruner fell apart the very first time I used it. The 'PowerGear' fell off and couldn't be reattached firmly to the pruner. I have used other Fiskar products many times and had normal expectations confirmed.Despite what a few other reviewers might say. everyone has the right to state accurate facts about a faulty product. Poor products deserve bad reviews. both to inform the manufacturer and to warn prospective purchasers about problems encountered. Amazon expects no less.I have processed the return package to send it back to Amazon and will try another unit. That said. I reserve the right to change my opinion should the second unit function properly."
1,"I have owned Mach3 razor for over 3 years now. The razor is good. but hard to differentiate its performance from Sense Excel ( I have owned that one before). Only reason I switched to Mach3 was honestly. I got bored using the same razor. The blades give normal performance. nothing out of the blue like they show on tv. It doesn't causes itching. so that the good part about the blades. However. after a month of use. for a good shave you will need multiple strokes on the same spot. Overall. decent purchase. nothing extraordinary."
12,"This game has crossed the 'I Like You' line. It's just like the old one from NES. although. I know about the dungeons and the weapons because I have the old one. So. it's fun to play for a while until you get to the Water Temple. it gets confusing there. So. use the Player's Guide to cheat. so that you won't get stuck. I played a long time ever since it came out. It was the game that caught my eye and though I had to have the game. I am a Zelda fan and I hope that you have fun playing it as well. I just like to see Link grow up."
7,"I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50. 75. and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course. it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility. which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather. but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking. but they're not kink-proof. either. nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others. but the latter were fairly stiff. so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase."
9,"Complete junk. As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI. the people that bought Aladdin. really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place. but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty. I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last. PMI can use the Stanleys history for their marketing ploys.  but they cannot steal the quality of the original."
10,"This is one item I would recommend people purchase from a local dealer not Amazon. Like another reviewer mentioned the packaging is terrible. I received mine and the small stationary wooden top of the table was broken into three parts even though the external packaging showed no real damage. This part breaks where it has grooves routed into it across its width. it is so badly supported I would expect it to get broken in shipment more often than not. The movable part of the table top also had some cosmetic damage. Amazon has been helpful but a replacement top arrived damaged as well. I just ended up making my own parts to fix it. The table is actually pretty good and I needed a fold down table given lack of space in my garage."
4,"I have recommended this movie more times than I can remember since I first saw it.  As a retired school teacher. I would say it is a MUST if you want children to be motivated toward excellence AND it assuredly gives parents a much needed 'heads up' about how much time our children are wasting on anything and everything that is not preparing them for their future success.  A true story is always the best movie for me and I am so glad I have this one in my library.  I am continually getting it out to share with someone."
4,"Beautifully acted and filmed (by the son of noted Holocaust denier Hutton Gibson). obviously made with 'passion' for the (literal and figurative) self-flagellation crowd. After the poor guy gets the lash for the 114th time (yeah. I know it's only 39; it just seemed like 114). with all that red-dyed corn syrup splattering all over the place. it just starts to get a little silly. kind of like the flying entrails in ANDY WARHOL'S FRANKENSTEIN. Capital punishment is. of course. not very funny. especially when the punishment is Death By Torture. so I did my best not to laugh.If Evangelicals. Opus Dei Catholics. sadists and other moonbats want to go all swooney over this sort of thing. they are most welcome to. To the curious. but more sqeamish. of my fellow nonbelievers. I would not suggest watching this after a heavy meal. If you must do so. keep a bucket handy."
12,"I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda... It is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love the story line. I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games. the good ones. tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games.  I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice."
10,"I bought this after my cheaper saw caught fire trying to cut a sidewalk with a mason blade.  The Milwaukee never flinched.  I have relied upon it for cutting wood. of course. but also occasional concrete and brick work.  It had a ten foot fall one time with no damage other than bending the bottom plate. which straightened quite well.  However. eye protection is a must.  I know it should always be. but admit that you have cheated and used squint protection a few times.  Not with this saw.  I tried different blades. but there is something about this saw that kicks dust in my eyes.  I was a little embarrassed when I was showing it off to my cheapo dad and all he commented on was the sawdust in his face.  I rarely use the Tilt-Lok. but it came in handy a couple of times."
9,"This is a great mat for the price. Enough cushion for floor exercise. easy to clean and carry. The one drawback is the fluffy nature of the foam. It isn't dense foam. So despite its thickness. it bottoms out pretty easily. making this a good mat for soft and slow moves. but wholly inadequate for anything that might involve impact. I used this for my prenatal yoga floor work and loved the cushy support for my aching hips and back. Overall. better than a typical extra thick yoga mat. but don't expect yoga mat density/quality."
11,"This game looked like fun but after trying it. I quickly lost interest. I like board games but this one was not my taste. It had too many parts and a bit complicated to play. I suppose if you love Mardi Gras with a passion. then you may like the game. At this time of writing my review it ranked 171.212 of games and toys. I would not suggest buying Party Gras unless you are a real Mardi Gras person or having a theme party. The target audience for this game is low. I give it a don't buy at any price.I rarely give a One Star on any review. but this is not what I expected. I can't say anything good about it and I don't recommend this game."
5,"This is a decent pop filter. It gets the job done but it has a few flaws. It attracts a good amount of dust. the screen tends to mess up (which caused me to tear the first screen). & the goose neck tends to unwrap it's self out of place. It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in. Other than that. it's a decent pop filter but not for the price. Under $10 would've been better. I should have went with something cheaper than $20 *cough cough* the Auphonix pop filter *cough cough* but. I will in the future."
10,"I purchased this for my jointer. but after setting all the pieces together on my bench. I realized the smallest width it could be was 16'. My jointer measures 12'. I had to put a plywood base into the finished framework to set the jointer on. I have the HTC mobil base and for now on thats what I will purchace. As with the other reviewers. It's sloppy with the 1 1/2' boards. The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop. They tell you to drill 7/16' holes and that is way to big. For those of you that don't have a drill press. you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides. This will give you a more accurate hole. I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base."
6,"These are great for small business owners like myself who do their own business cards. rather than paying out for someone else to do them.  As long as you have a good printer. they work very well.  The only negative I could say about them is that you have to print one sheet at a time.  You can't stack 2 or more sheets in your paper tray and tell your design software to print multiples.  If you do. you'll ruin at least one sheet of cards.  It's a bit inconvenient to have to load a sheet. click print. wait.  Load a sheet. click print. wait.  Other than that. I have no complaints."
6,"These 'Avery White Shipping Labels' are perfect for my use.  Before I got these. I used two address labels on all my postage: One for the address of the person with whom I am corresponding and another for my return address.With this label I am able to fit my return address on the upper left side of the label  and the shipping address on the lower right side of the label.One of the nice things about Avery products is that a person can get a template free that works well with each specific product.  In this case a person can get Avery template 5163 (template and software) on the internet.  I have used Avery templates for many years and found them perfect for the designed label (in this case label 5263).I recommend 'Avery White Shipping Labels for Laser Printers'.  This is a quality product."
5,"I love this product. It came fast. included extra shockmount line. shockmount. an adapter. the mic. instructions. and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting. The sound quality is great with the Art Tube Preamp(use mic cables. not 1/4' cables for Phantom Power). and I couldn't be happier with it. It even looks impressive. Although. I do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny. when in reality it is this 'off-silver' color. Almost a gold. but not quite. It's not bad or anything. just different. And frankly. the thing could be purple for all I care- as long as it produces great sound. that's all that matters. Great product. and extremely affordable. No complaints."
11,"This fits perfectly.  Put all the angry reviews aside and choose for yourself .  I shopped around to find the best deal.  The elf that comes with the book looks nothing like a girl.  This skirt helps fix that.  The doll kinda looks creepy without it.  This might be what prevents screams in terror.  I was worried my kids would be scared of the doll after the first time I saw it for myself.  The skirt softens the creep factor.  Considering how many stories I hear of kids being terrorfied of the bow elf doll.  This should be considered.  We bought this and one other design and my girls love their adopted elf"
7,"My neighbor's cat loves coming in my yard each afternoon to claw my screens and harass my indoor cats through the windows.  Nothing worked to keep him away - pepper granules. citrus sprays. commercial pest repellants. or mothballs.  My sister purchased Scarecrow for me and I had low hopes - but it certainly exceeded my expectations! The first day it was up & running. the cat came by. got blasted with it twice from about 15' away. and ran away scared to death - and I haven't seen him in my yard since!  Scarecrow is a little inconvenient when I forget it's on and walk into my back yard. but it's worth the inconvenience to keep the neighborhood cat away for good.  I would highly recommend to anyone with a pest problem!"
2,"I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum. I live in a small place with all hardwood floors. so something small and light was on the top of my list.This vacuum is perfect for my needs. It has great suction. I feel it suck down to the floor! And is lightweight.The only cons (and they aren't big ones) are:the unit gets really hot. really fast. It's not a big deal. but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage. But I guess you can really only expect that with a larger unit.Other than that. its' great. lots of power.I don't think I would recommend for long carpets. or an all carpeted place. We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that."
11,"I was skeptical of the foam mat when I opened the package. but it actually works well. My twins were about 15 months when we first bought and to my surprise were able to get the concept of this toy. however would get frustrated and give up quickly. At 19 months they have this toy mastered. They have developed several ways to play with it from sorting colors. building towers. and even putting them on their fingers and pretending they are puppets. It sometimes keeps their attention for half an hour. A great addition to our toy collection!"
9,"I have been so sick of failed air mattresses that deflate or get the mystery holes. and you spend a lot of money on them.  I decided to try these.  I bought three of them. one for myself and my two kids. This is much more comfortable to me as when I shared a mattress with my kids I would be the one squishing it down. as I weigh much more than them. and waking up with my hips on the ground; which really killed my back!  These mattresses can be a pain to air up and deflate. but with the use of a pump both of those processes are much easier."
11,"My daughter is in the first grade and reads for 20 minutes as part of her homework. She also has a tendency to move from one line to the next mid sentence. so I wanted to get her something that would help her stay on the line that she was reading. I figured this would be nice since she could also have a timer at hand that would be easy  for her to check to see how much time she had left. She really enjoys it. it is also nice as a bookmark and helping her keep her place on the page. I am very happy with it."
4,"Outstanding. Not only did Mel Gibson show the suffering that Jesus endured on his final hours of life. but the compassion and loving kindness he has for all mankind.When I went to see this film. which was on the very first release day. when the film ended not one person left the cinema. We all sat there and watched as the credits and music played. I am not sure why we did this. Maybe we saw what life is truly about. and we didn't want it to end there. Or maybe we were shocked that this happened. and we have taken it for granted for all these years.What I do know is that this film is outstanding. It is the best film I have ever seen. because it impacted me in such a positive and good way. Highly recommended."
1,"These batteries have a specific use: They are the navy seal or special ops of batteries. You don't want to use them in your every day juicing of low drain applications. They are for the knock down drag out applications that other batteries can only handle for minutes. Camera flashes.  Remote control cars. High drain applications where you need a battery that can go in and provide high power for a specific use.They're expensive. they're finely tuned to provide maximum output for maximum time on high drain activities. Don't waste them on remote controls. mice or smoke detectors."
2,"My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.  I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.  I am very pleased with it.  It is fairly quiet for a vacuum cleaner. my old model used to scream like a banshee.  and it doesn't have a bunch of hoses wrapped around it constantly coming loose like my old model.  It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor. this model is great."
9,"My only experience with playing Horseshoes is when I was a kid with my Dad. so I wasn't quite sure what to look for when I got the whim to build a pit in our backyard.  I went to the local sporting store and looked at sets and they seemed kind of cheesy so I came on here to look up sets and found this one.  It was a little pricier than the ones in the store so I was hesitant to order. but after reading the reviews I did and after getting I them I found they are definitely worth the few extra bucks.  They are quality. well-constructed and Made in the USA.  They feel good in my hand and came with instructions to refresh me on how to play the game.  The paint has chipped some but that hasn't bothered me since it doesn't interfere in playing the game.  I would recommend this set to anyone interested in backyard games."
4,"I think everyone should see this movie at least once. Then never again. There is this cool book. the Bible. tells the whole story without all the blood and tears. I saw this movie with a group of my friends and we were all crying by the end. Even the ones who aren't religious. It is a very powerful movie. But not a movie I would want to see over and over again. Not only because there is not a lot of replay value. but also because of the sheer violence."
5,"These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control.....They Have a Gell  center.  Whitch  tingles.  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks.These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say....If U have hand problems.  try these.....they really work."
7,"This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed. The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely. The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture. being a flimsy plastic. but it does what it is supposed to perfectly. There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage. The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special. but are again. quite effective. I have placed a variety of seeds in this. from tomatoes. to peppers to quinoa to tobacco. and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days. Anyways. even though of flimsy manufacture. the price is right and the goods are effective. so i give this 4 stars accordingly. Just be gentle with it. and if necessary. save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy!"
2,"I connected some quick disconnect fittings to this Y fitting. Two of the openings in this Y were the right size. but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it. but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency."
5,"Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking. bending. becoming dull or unusable. They keep on keeping on and I have one in every case.Buy. you'll love it. and if not. you can always return it.Hope this helps!"
11,"We purchased this for my in-laws for Christmas this year and played with my father-in-law. step-mother-in-law. brother-in-law (11). and sister-in-law (13).  Everyone LOVED it.  The game was quick to pick up and start playing as the rules are not too complicated. As we played more it remained challenging as we all started to develop more strategy.  Played with 6 people and the games usually averaged 30 minutes - about the perfect time."
12,"Zelda &quot;occarina of time&quot; is much like the rest of the Zelda series... it doesn't disappoint! With really cool items to collect and using your songs/spells to warp around. the entire game offers whole new dimensions.Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world. play carnival-like games to win power-ups. collect hard-to-find items such as the two-handed sword (which is better than the master sword. but you can't use a shield). magically powered arrows. and more!This game is fairly easy to beat. but finding everything will take you much longer!"
8,"My dog absolutely loves these treats and I really feel they have helped her! She has a congenital hip problem and now arthritis has set in. She has a very pronounced limp after laying down for awhile. but since she's been eating these treats. we've noticed a difference in her not limping nearly as bad. I was going to purchase another bag this past week. but the price jumped up over $3.00 per bag in the short time since I purchased them the first time. I ended up looking at more treats with glucosamine in them and bought something else that seemed to be a better price & she at least likes them. I really wish the price hadn't jumped up so much because I would have bought more. but the difference was too much for me!!"
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply  tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.The Shuttle is not speedy. but again adds some nice abilities and characters and the support role it can add to a fleet is quite a lot of fun"
10,"Sturdy with an adjustable mouth and blade tilt.Understand you will need to prep this before use. The sole is not precision ground but machine rough. so you will need a granite block and sandpaper or a set of flat block diamond hones. Once you have your sole (and sides) honed and flat you will need to sharpen the blade. There are several jigs and sharpening tools to assist in this. After all is done apply an anti-rust agent such as wood wax or Boeshield.Once prep'd this is a great plane."
9,"It's a Swiss Army Classic. It's designed to hang on your keychain. You may read some reviews complaining the scissors or blade aren't very &#34;robust&#34; or it doesn't have this or that. If you want any of that they make SAKs for that. This is if you need a few basic functions on your key chain for cutting tags (knife). trimming loose threads (scissors). eliminating a stray hair (tweezers) or getting lunch out of your teeth (toothpick).Now that the rant on unrealistic expectations out of the way. I can get back to the product. Victorinox continues to do a nice job with the Classic. Quality is what I expect from an SAK. small and functional little knife. I carry it every day just like my Dad taught me."
12,"This is a classic game that I come back to every now and again. The graphics are great and the content is really satisfying. But I do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the game.1st island - The easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems. The hardest level here is Native Fortress.2nd island - Slightly harder but still fun. The hardest level here is Sunset Vista.3rd island - The most frustrating. I spent half an hour to beat Generator Room with Perfect and another half an hour with Toxic Waste. The hardest level here is Slippery Climb.I don't get why a kid's game can get difficult to beat. I mean. I own mature games like Jak 2 and Oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison. If you are looking for a challenging game. this is your cup of tea. But if you want a kid's game that you can just glide through. I recommend Spyro."
5,"I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks! They are so grippy. I haven't broken a single one yet. they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio. so it's hard to loose them. but I still do. If you have like a child. nephew. niece. sibling. or parent that plays guitar or bass you can't go wrong with getting these for them. or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord. and if you are lucky enough not to break them. they just slip out of your hands while you're playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however. and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that."
1,"I didn't expect much from this cream but it really does work. On a fresh scar it began softening and smoothing the tissue within 2 weeks. I am just starting to try it on a much older scar so I can't really comment on that. Its a bit greasy and probably expensive over the long haul but I am excited by the promise and the results so far.+++++update 2/10:  Update February 2010. I had to have very nasty knee surgery last month resulting in a 10' vertical scar over the cap. I began using Mederma as soon as I got the staples out and it is working very well. softening the look and feel of the scar tissue."
8,"I ordered three of these and this item is great. I own an 11 week old German Shepherd puppy that loves to chase a tennis ball and she grows bigger every single day. I was afraid that if I got a ball that was 'her' size that I would not be able to keep it as she grows. but these seem to be just the right size. she can carry it around in her mouth just fine - she was carrying regular ones at 7 weeks!They float and they also bounce great like a normal tennis ball. just bigger. Only time will tell about the durability. but these seem like the right size for large dog breeds to play fetch with in and out of the water."
11,"The fabric calendar comes with 25 bundle-figures with the traditional figures of a Nativity and a few contemporary characters sure to make your little ones laugh (a cat and a dog). Each figure comes with the corresponding number on the back. thus. no need to guess where each goes. However. although they are rated by degree of importance. you cannot see the numbers thus. if you wanted to place them in a different order. it is completely possible. Each figure can be attached to the nativity scene through rounds of velcro that held very well the whole 25 days. The images are charming (just like traditional Little People toys) and the colors are beautiful. The numbers are lined by color so as you can see. other than teaching about the nativity. the calendar can be used to reach about numbers. colors and dates. Good investment."
4,"My 2 year-old son loves almost anything Elmo. so this was a no-brainer.  This was the first Elmo's World DVD I bought for him. because he loves dogs and farms.  It turns out. though. that the baby segment is his favorite.  We like to sing along with 'Old MacDonald.'  Now that we have Tivo. I could have just recorded the last 20 minutes of Sesame Street every day. but this DVD was a nice addition to our library."
11,"My son is now working on his second book - after last year's success. we will be doing a book every year (he's 6 now).  The book takes time to do properly. and certainly needs an adult's help at this age. but the end result is more worthwhile than virtually any other gift he's gotten.  The look on his face. seeing his name and story and pictures put together in the beautifully bound book...  I'll never forget it. and I never have to.  It happens every time he reads HIS book!  Highly recommended"
11,"At first I considered not getting this game. but after watching plenty of YouTube videos about the gameplay and strategy involved I decided to go for it. This game is super fun and involves a lot of strategy. I've played it with my family and they enjoy it a lot. especially since it's concepts are super streamlined and it's easy to &#34;see&#34; what is going on unlike a lot of other designer board games. The learn curve for this is very short since it's mainly just placing workers each turn. I enjoy it a lot and I just got a hold of the expansion for it. so I'm excited to give it a try. Give this game a try if you know you like worker placement."
1,"These are lightweight and efficient and have some very good points:- the batteries last 2-3 months with daily use.- the LED is bright enough and adequately covers the whole magnified area under the 3X lens-- the lens itself is glass and good quality- the shell is plastic and it&#8217;s very light (but may not take a beating over time)-  it&#8217;s easy to open and turn on the light and the sliding mechanism has never failedI bought a six-pack of these from another vendor and all I can say is to shop around because prices vary tremendously.  I use this magnifier to inspect seeds and leaves.  I keep these magnifiers on my desk. in my briefcase. and in a backpack and I like them a lot."
9,"Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue.unlike the black/gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy.wrong!This product is as shoddy as most 'BEll products' are.The rear light went out first.then the front light shorted out after a minor drop.Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i've learned not to trust the viability of 'Bell products' ever again.That's why i'm now a 'Cateye's' and 'Nite Ize' product fan.Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost."
1,"I put this lotion on everything. It is hands down one of the most important beauty products that I couldnt live without. I use this all over and it is the ONLY lotion I have found which 1. doest break me out. 2. actually moisturizes my skin. 3. I can use on my body and my face. I blend drops of hyaluronic acid which I buy from Amazon in with the moisturizer for an added boost. It keeps my skin glowing. smooth and beautiful.I also use this on my boyfriends KP and it is the first time he said he has had any success in getting it to go away.I am impressed with this product more than any other beauty product."
6,"I bought these to print out pictures. cut them up into puzzle pieces. and place them on a magnetic rectangle so they can be rearranged into the right places. The magnet they are placed on is pretty substantial (at least the thickness of all 5 sheets of this paper). and the puzzle pieces stick fine when the whole thing is lying on a table. but when I lift it up sometimes the pieces fall off!I tried sticking a piece on my fridge and it wouldn't stay--and the packaging says it will stick AND hold up a piece of paper on most metal surfaces. I couldn't get it to stick at all! And the magnetic paper just stuck on a good magnet doesn't even stay very well when it's lifted off the table so that gravity is affecting the pieces. Overall. it works fine for my purposes because the puzzles are meant to stay on a table. but I just can't see any use for them beyond that."
6,"The item holds my new 22 inch LCD just fine.It doesn't bounce and shake if knocked. so the monitor is nice and safe.We bought three and all three came with cheap. sloppy paint jobs. So to match my all black computer I spray painted them and it looks like I bought it that way.The space under is perfect for my Logitech Wave Keyboard to slid out of the way or a nice place to throw those pads of sticky notes. pens and whatnots.OVERALL:We've bought one for all three family members and its been great to gain some desk space and ensure we are more ergonomic by having the monitor at the correct hight for the desk/chair setup. Its the cheapest metal unit I could find and it holds up under the weight just fine."
9,"Been using this for years. A little goes a long way. and it gets you clean and minty. Makes your eyelids and. um. some other parts. tingle like mad. to the point of being nearly annoying. but it is a transient sensation. Don't get this stuff in your eyes while wearing contacts. burns like hell. But that is true of many soaps.  I use this stuff for both soap and shampoo. it is gentle enough for that. at least for a (non-metro) guy."
9,"The 38' size is a good deal for the price and works okay.  I did manage to put it together all by my lonesome instead of the 3 people the directions say are needed.  But... The chemical odor from the blue stretch cover is AWFUL.  I am going to stick this thing outside to see if that helps air it out.  If not. the cover is coming off.  It is too strong to use right now and that is why the 3 stars.  Nothing made for living creatures should smell that horrible.  I refuse to use it further until the smell is gone.I'd love to hear if others have had this issue."
6,"If you are the person that wraps gifts with the comics section of the paper or buys 99 cent rolls of paper then this would be a bit of overkill for you. if you care about your package and you purchase high quality paper then you need this tape. it looks great! The satin finish can't be beat. For about 4 bucks you get about 27 yards of tape. I think that is quite acceptable. If you buy those 50 cent rolls from Big Lots or Walmart you will only get about 6 yards of tape per roll and its crappy tape.The one thing that annoys me to no end with this is the serrated cutting bar. If if were just a smidge wider than the tape it would work way better. Many times it has not cut the tape correctly unless it's just right-so annoying!I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this? no"
4,"We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies. dogs. and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well. And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies. dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies. Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids."
6,"I have a bad lower back and currently enrolled in physical therapy. I have pain going down the back of one leg. To me it seemed as though propping up that foot alleviated the foot pain. I had a more expensive foot rest in my cart and decided to give a cheaper model a try first to see if it cut down on my leg pain. FWIW - It has a bit. but not entirely. now onto the review.As others alluded to. this is an expensive piece of plastic. It is very cheaply made. It has two levels that you can chose from a higher or lower resting level. This has a rocker like motion so that you're feet aren't in a set position all the time. However. this rocking motion is not fluid. and is downright noisy.It does tend to stay in place well. and serves its purpose. I would say that there are better choices out there."
1,"First of all. let me say that whenever I tried a brand other than 'Band-aid' I was disappointed.  That said. I believe this particular style is the best I have found.  When I was having a lot of trouble with eczema on my right hand. I needed to wear band-aids on two of my fingers. to protect them so they would heal.  All the other bandaids either had fabric that began to unravel almost immediately or the cushion area was too small or the length of the bandaid was too short.  This one is just right. The whole bandaid is 2 7/8 inches long.  The cushion part is a quilted 1 inch by 1 inch square and has a nice thickness to it.  Also. the actual fabric of the bandaid is a sort of rubber-plastic. so it does not unravel and it stays on pretty well.  It is water resistant.  Buy this one for your general use.  You will probably save money in the long run."
8,"We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement. Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat. corn. soy. by-products. or artificials.Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine. but I've taken it for years with wonderful results. and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course. I'll be ordering another."
9,"I recently purchased one of these coolers and am very pleased with how well it worked. as quiet as a whisper.  The power consumption is reasonable.  If battery drain is a concern. once the Koolatron is cold you can unplug it for a while and it will stay cool for quite some time.The only thing I had to watch out for was that it froze my soda pop because I used it in a cool environment when it should have been switched off.  Only the things in the very bottom of the cooler froze.  Everything else was just fine.The Koolatron is attractive with contemporary colors - white. beige. and grey.  It's slender rectangular profile is proportioned for pop or beer cans to fit perfectly.  It's a well thought out product worth what they are asking for it.  Cool stuff.Overall. I am very happy with this purchase and am excited that I finally have a safe means for storing food in my camper van."
6,"These shipping labels work great for recycling mailers.  I've used them to mail several packages & it's a great convenience to no longer have to spend five minutes or more trying to peel off old labels before re-using padded mailers.With Avery's TrueBlock technology. it's a snap to quickly print a label that completely covers the old label. These labels work just like conventional laser labels--just use Avery's template to print the labels you need.  The 'magic' is in the dark. vinyl-like coating on the 'sticky side' of the label.  This dark screening coat completely blocks out the label underneath. so nothing shows through.  Just a clean. neatly printed new. bright white label.Elegantly engineered recycling solution; Highly recommended!"
11,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So. three stars for a well made product. zero for fun."
1,"BOTTLE TYPES WE OWNWe have numerous water bottles and stainless containers (Foogoo. Camelbak. Thermos to name a few).  Some are BPA free plastic. some stainless inside and out.BOTTLE NECK SIZEThe neck opening of each of our bottles varies from 1.5 inches up to 3 inches (this is a Foogoo lunch container).BRUSH BRISTLES AND PERFORMANCEThis brush is the best one we have tried (we have tried three other brands).  The bristles are firm enough to clean the bottles. but soft enough not to scratch them (unlike others we have tried).  The handle just below the brush is flexible so it bends making it very easy to get every nook and cranny in all our containers.We use it on a daily basis.  I donated our other ones after receiving this."
4,"The collaborative work of Katherine Davis. Henry Onorati and harry Simeone. 'The Little Drummer Boy' is delightful retelling of a classic Christmas story and song wonderfully combined with the glowing. full-color illustrations of Ezra Jack Keats and the iconic music and vocals of John Jennings in superbly produced. flawlessly recorded. six-minute DVD format. A very highly recommended addition to family. school. and community library Christmas DVD collections. 'The Little Drummer Boy' is also available from Weston Woods in a Paperback/CD format (NPCD124. $18.95) and a Paperback/Cassette format (NPRA124. $14.95)."
1,"Put quite simply. OXO has done it again!  The quality of this Good Grips Bottle Brush exceeds all expectations in both design and execution.  The engineers at OXO are experts at what they do and their dedication to customer satisfaction is clearly seen in this superb brush.  Anyone who has purchased any OXO product will testify to the satisfaction one feels in using said product as well as the incredible value OXO always presents.  The OXO Good Grips Bottle Brush satisfies as no other brush possibly can because no other proudly displays OXO on the label.  OXO defines value. excellence. durability. and satisfaction and the Good Grips Bottle Brush is virtually OXO writ large."
6,"I often buy colored envelopes because I think they look so nice when you get them in a stack of mostly white mail. But if you want to use labels. the white rectangles look so ugly. These are perfect! I find they don't stick quite as well as the white ones. but never had one come off and get returned.They don't really help with dark colored paper (including most reds) because the black ink doesn't stand out enough). but for pastels or off whites. they are beautiful."
11,"I have always loved the feel of plastic cards like these. I have played another game that uses stacking plastic cards over each other (some Cranium game I don't remember the name of). but this one is a bit different. The artwork is cute. But. for some reason. I do not really get into the storytelling aspect of this game. I feel like the gameplay is just so-so. I feel like it is really easy for a person to get really ahead quickly. I never am really excited to play a game of Gloom with my friends. but it can be fun from time to time. I like that the games can be over fairly quickly (within 1 hour)."
8,"The Chuckit Launcher is a necessity if you have a dog that enjoys the game of fetch.  I have always known about this product but considered it for the lazy man.  My yellow lab has enough energy to make a game of fetch feel like pitching nine innings in the big leagues.  It would get to the point where I would have to ice my shoulder.  I eventually invested in one of these and now use it regularly.  Once you get the hang of the throwing motion you can launch the ball incredible distances with very little effort.It came with a fuzzy tennis ball which I eventually replaced with a Chuck glow ball.  This rubber ball is much better then any tennis ball and glows in the dark so I can use it at night.I gave this 5 stars because it has now become an essential tool to deal with my dogs energy.  Keeping her exercised makes life a lot easier in the house."
10,"Adding a zero cleareance substantially increased the quality of my cuts. I was cross-cutting plywood with my old Delta blade. The tear-out was surprisingly bad considering that the blade was sharpened recently. I dropped this insert in place and the tear-out was nearly gone. In other words. this thing really works.I love tools that work. Couple of other notes:  The set screws work really well but they are really tight. I had to use my cordless drill to adjust them. Second. the bright yellow color is nice because it is a stark reminder of the danger zone.By the way. if you experience a lot of noise. the directions state that it is probably the blade rubbing on the insert. The solution is to widen the kerf slighty with a bit of sandpaper. I haven't experienced any noise."
6,"I'm actually a travel agent. and I purchased these to use in plastic luggage tags that I give to my clients.  They work just fine.  I do find that the edges look a little better than other brands that I've tried. though because of the way I use them. that's not as much of an issue for me. it certainly would be if you're actually using them as your business card.  On other brands. you will sometimes see a little 'fiber' around the card. and you don't see that with these."
1,"My husband is very picky about shave gels. primarily because he is most concerned about razor glide and his sensitive skin.  My mistake on this product was not purchasing just one can of this for him to try instead of getting him a six-pack. even though the price was under $3 a can with super saver shipping.  He is not happy with this product.  He's been using this product since April and does not think that it lathers anywhere near as well as other products. namely. Gillette Fusion. which he prefers.  Also. insofar as use on his sensitive skin. the gel is only so-so.  The fragrance is okay with him.  However. what he particularly doesn't like is that the gel does not promote smooth razor glide.  Now we have about four cans left. which he will grudgingly use. unless I can find him a deal on Fusion.  He's encouraging me to find one...soon."
8,"I have a bloodhound/coonhound/black lab mix. He is a very aggressive chewer (he gnaws on stuff until it's gone) and I've always had problems finding toys he doesn't destroy.I ordered the Souper size. which was a good size for him. It held up longer than other bones I have ordered. but I had to throw it away after about an hour. The bone is very solid. but what he ended up doing was dragging his teeth on it. which created large chunks of sharp. hard plastic. He got a few pieces off of it before he cut his gums on it and yelped. After an unfruitful search for the missing pieces and some time cleaning the blood off the carpet. into the trash it went!Overall I'd say it's a nice product. just not the right one for very aggressive chewers."
2,"I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours. I looked everywhere for the smallest size. they were either unavailable or too expensive. Reviews here showed great product so I bought it. I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied. Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes. I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking. It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook."
6,"I received this through the Amazon vine program.  These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label.  The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it.  I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling."
11,"My daughter began playing this game at age 6.  She will now play it with anyone who offers!  It is challenging and fun for adults as well.  The only downsides are that you need a fairly large. flat surface to create the tile patterns. and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game.  If you bump the table and jar the tiles. it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far-along.  Overall. however. I highly recommend it. even for adults."
10,"I've made hundreds of cuts on this 6' dado set over the last 5 years.I've been happy. but it's not perfect. and I think Freud sometimes charges for their name when less expensive competitors are about as good. I would tryMibro 491071 6-Inch Stacking Dado BladeorOshlun SDS-0630 6-Inch 30 Tooth Stack Dado Setif I needed another set.The case is well designed. Saves you time. and saves the blades. The red plastic wing nut thingees both cracked. but Freud sent me new ones when asked.It would be nice if the shims were factory labeled. You need to clean. measure. and mark them. and the marker writing eventually wears off.There is sometimes a little blow-out on the cross-cuts. but any dado set will do that. Use a scrap of wood against the trailing edge."
1,"I use this for everything; back pain. sore muscles. sprains. it works great on them all! It doesn't smell great. but not any worse than icy hot or something like that and you don't have to get it all over your hands to apply it. It feels sort of cool when you put it on. but warms up a la icy hot after a bit...but it really does help the soreness go away! I carry it in my purse for those moments when my back acts up and I need instant relief- definitely a great buy!"
6,"After years of using an ink-jet printer. I finally bought an economical laser printer.  These laser labels are perfect for the kind of labels that I keep handy - a few dozen printed labels for each family member. and my own return labels.I had no problem running these through my Brother laser printer. using Word 2011 for Mac. template 5267.  Avery is always worth the extra money! Their quality is outstanding. and this product is no different.  The labels don't jam. they line up properly. and they peel easily.  In other words. they work well. and they don't annoy me when I go to use them. and that is something I look for in a product I pay a premium for.  Avery is my go-to for printer products -- worth the few extra cents (or even a dollar) because I know it will get the job done over the months the packet will be in my desk drawer."
1,"Have used this Homeopathic gel for decades. As a professionally trained Modern. and Classical Ballet. dancer for over 30 + years. I have sworn by this for preventative as well as helping to speed-up recovery/healing time of sports-type & over-use injuries. Ii is essential to us dancers and athletes alike. Great for contusions. bruises and over-use injuries. Recommend. Only remember to remove all oils and perfumes from skin BEFORE using. and to be diligent enough to use in the morning and evening both. for best results."
6,"So far I've used this double sided foam tape to mount photos and mounted a small clock on glass. It hasgood holding power and rated to hold 2 lbs. It does depend what you mount to. someone stated it wouldn'thold on plaster walls. if the surface you use is weak the tape isn't going to change this fact. I mounted abadge back on a cars painted surface. this tape is strong enough for jobs like this. This is a good generaluse double sided white foam tape. the roll is 1/2' wide X 75' long. other sizes are offered but I found thisis a good general use size."
9,"I bought mine from a nearby Wal-Mart and it's worked perfectly so far.  Having never installed one before. I just took my time & had some extra zip ties ready...just in case.  The only tool you'll need is something to trim the ends off the zip ties when you're done.  I like the 'scan' mode which flips thru max speed. avg. speed. distance. total time. etc.  On the down side. I bought another for my son's bike.  It either had a bad sensor or a broken wire from the sensor to the unit.  It never did work.  I took it back for a refund.  For $10 - what do you expect?  You may get one that works fine - you may not."
6,"As I writer. I am often sending out short story manuscripts to potential markets. I'm a great recycler of envelopes. but I spend far too much time trying to peel and/or scrape off the old labels while trying not to tear into the envelopes. These thick labels (they call it 'TrueBlock Technology') will go right on top of the old labels and cover them up completely. Works like a charm! They're big enough for long addresses or large fonts. and you can even create logo shipping labels with them."
2,"Here in Penna. we make pickled eggs. also known here as red beet eggs.  I use this container for that.  The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.  The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.  I've had mine for five to ten years. and it is still good as new.  I just bought one for my mother.  She had her red beets eggs in a jar. which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.  I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.  I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.  I also know someone who uses hers. without the strainer. to store brown sugar.  So. it is a multi-purpose container."
12,"FF7... if you've ever played this game. the words send shivers of delight down your spine. Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one. The world's in trouble thanks to a large corporation (Shinra) who is. basically. sucking the planet dry of its natural resources. Bummer. That's where Cloud. Barrett. and Tifa (oh. yeah. there's this girl named Aeris... hint: be nice to her at al times) come in. equipped with HUGE swords. a Gun-Arm (gotta get me one of those). and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos. The game is a marvel to play. and is clearly addictive. The gameplay is perfect. with tight controls which respond perfectly. an intuitive Materia (Magic) sysetm. and some kick ... bosses. ..."
11,"Party Gras is a fun game. IF you have a couple of things readily available:1. A Large Group of People - Party Gras shows a minimum of 4 players. but that is too small a group to play. Party Gras is best played with a group of 10 or more.2. People willing to be goofy. - You really have to lose your inhabitions playing Party Gras. If you have some party poopers. afraid to look foolish. then they will hate this game.3. Adult Beverages - This can REALLY help with loosening people up.The whole idea of Party Gras is to complete tasks given on a card - For instance getting another player to ask you to lower your voice. meaning you have to begin talking loudly until someone asks you to quiet down. To win the gamye you have to collect beads from other players while giving yours away. But in reality. Party Gras's main purpose is get folks laughing and having a good time. it's not really about winning or losing."
12,"Sonic Heroes will be EXTREMELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!  I haven't played it yet. but I know it will be great. and hopefully the bad camera views from the Adventure series will be vanished.When I say A blast from the past. I mean that Sonic Heroes is one of his old games. blown up into 3D. (New stages. of course...)I can't think of anything else to put!  Just get Sonic Heroes when it comes out cuz IT'TL ROCK!"
10,"It's really a pity that this saw is no longer made. I bought mine over 20 years ago. and since then it's built cabinets in my house. remodeled a friend's restaurant. and been loaned out many time. It's light. powerful. and cuts very smoothly with no vibration. If you're making cabinetry and not cutting 2x lumber you really don't need a 7-1/2&#34; saw. This unit is smaller. lighter. and a real pleasure to use. I'm hoping I can keep mine going for another decade or two."
10,"This collector does a fine job. It has great power and makes little noise. I ran hundreds of feet of hose and bought all kinds of blast gates and attachments for everything I could think of. It works but only for one tool at a time. I guess I'm trying to do too much with it. It will run all day without a complaint. I bought a remote start for it though . I think it's a good thing to have. If you have a small shop you can't beat this unit. It has a little more power than some of the others in this price range."
10,"I've had the sander for about a year now and it is pretty good overall.  The compact size lets it go into tight workspaces.  It is light weight and can easily be operated with one hand.  This weekend I spent about 7 hours sanding and even after several hours of continuous use it worked well.  I have a couple of small complaints.  First the dust bag does tend to pop off frequently. which can be a messy nuisance.  In addition. the dust collection is poor.  Most of thet sawdust ends up in the air.  Next you can really feel the vibration in your hands.  After about 2 hours my hands feel like they are falling asleep.  Also the unit gets very hot after prolonged use.  It won't get hot enough to burn you. but it does make it more uncomfortable to hold.  On the plus side. it has a good quality compact case that holds plenty of sandpaper."
1,"I have read from a lot of people saying it doesn't leave you groggy but if I take more than half a teaspoon I find it makes me that way.  I don't take melatonin unless I cant sleep at all or if I am not tired but it starts to work pretty fast no matter how much I take.  I guess since its a liquid it affects you quicker since I have used the pill form before.  My 3 year old who is autistic has problems sleeping and staying asleep and as far as getting to sleep she will usually go to sleep in about 10 to 15 minutes.  This was recommended over medication from our doctor which is what we prefer.  She still wakes up some nights but I don't think it has too much to do with the melatonin as it is with her.  Overall I recommend this to help people sleep naturally without resorting to medication."
10,"I bought this saw about a month ago now and have used it a few times. Its very smooth. Very little vibration and when you bolt it down on quarter inch rubber it has no vibration at all. (I used an old tire inner tube.) I bought this with a Moto foot pedal. That leaves your hands on your work. The tension lever is great. Right up front where it should be. The cast table size is great for bigger projects. I got this saw as a member of Amazon Prime. I ordered it overnight air with Saturday delivery. It was an extra $9.95 freight. This is a 66 lb saw. Gotta love Amazon Prime."
9,"These bands are great.  The only room for improvement would be better carabiners/clips.  The carabiner like things have sticky springs and have sharp edges which could potentially cut through the bands.  It is nice to be able to attach the bands to other things and I have used a bit of rope to tie them off to poles and trees.  Use a bowline around the tree and a linemans loop to secure an additional carabiner to.  This set comes with an exercise guide.  These bands are good when paired with the BMP exercise ball because you can focus on muscle groups.  Isolate the hips for those ab exercises!  Have fun. mix it up!"
2,"This is the second one of these I have purchased.  I bought the last one several years ago and it is still running strong.  I wanted a second one to keep upstairs.  This little Quick Up is exactly as advertised. What a time saver.  It is  light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless.  It is a little Go To machine and I think anyone would be glad they purchased it.  This would be a great gift I think anyone would be delighted to receive.change"
10,"This thing is a BEAST. it will eat up and chew through any wood you are looking to refinish.  I matched this up with some 40 grit belt sandpaper and it was able to chew right through the old finish on my redwood deck.  I had used a less powerful 3x18 belt sander and there was no comparison.  While this is much heavier and you do have to stay on top of it so it doesn't get out of control. I will take that over the slower process of sanding my previous belt sander offered.  The only negative I found was there was no case/bag that came with the sander beyond that I am very happy."
2,"I purchased this timer to replace an earlier version of the same timer that stopped working.  I started out looking for a different brand. but this one was the lowest cost option.The pros:+  Low cost + free Amazon shipping!+  Easy installation & the dial plate fits over the existing switch opening.+  Easy to operate. with the exception noted below.+  Quiet operation... the fan noise is louder.The cons:-  No manual off?  It's odd they removed the manual off feature that we got used to on the earlier version of this timer.-  The knob is a bear to push on & just as difficult to remove!  I suggest installing & removing the knob a few times to loosen it up. before installing the timer.&#9658; Update - January 9. 2014This timer has been working perfectly since we installed it.  We still miss the manual off feature. :("
9,"Hands down the best air mattress I have ever used! All summer all over the country I have used this thing often relying souly on it to do the job and it performs flawless! I hope they keep the quality up. good to have a few of these things in the house or camping gear. I am 6'2&#34; and about 165 and works perfect. My hip bones don't touch the ground at all and hold nearly all it's air throughout the camping week. It's heavy not for backpacking but that's why I like it. Beach trips. people visiting. car camping. and fitting into small tents. I even accidentally laid this thing out on too of small cactus and barns in the outer banks and it never popped!"
9,"I've wanted one of these tools for a long time and I finally decided to go for it. I've handled the SwissTool as well as multi tools by Leatherman and SOG. which are brands I highly respect. I decided for the SwissTool because it feels more like a 'real' tool than the others. It is simply more substantial. appears to be sturdier. The tools locking open is also a great feature and that alone had a lot to do with my choice. You can't go wrong with any of the 3 name brands but if you need durability the choice is easier.Note: the tool comes with a sheath. So unless you dislike nylon. you don't need to order the sheath separately."
6,"Scotch states this is for permanent mounting. but I'd hold back on that until a year goes by.  I did use it for a wall calendar which is nice. in that I don't have to drive a nail into the wall.  But the biggest use I have for Scotch's (double sided) mounting tape is for flat surfaces.  Where most people have kids knocking things about. I have little earthquakes but most horrendously. cats!  My two Bengal cats will knock anything and everything off the shelves or countertops.  I have some glass vases. vertical standing frames and a glass decanter sitting on shelves.  I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf.  I've witnessed these cats walking all around them without being able to knock them off to shatter on the floor.  For that peace of mind alone. this tape is worth it.  Plus the price is right."
4,"I'm a Christian and from day one I thought I have to go and see this. I went last night with a couple of friends and I'm telling the film was overwhelming. The film was so different yet excellent and you could feel what Jesus was going through. not just physically but emotionally and psychologically too. The film is basically about the last 12 hours leading to Jesus' death but there are a lot of messages portrayed in this film. It's one of those films where you watch and analyse for yourself. This film really makes you think and is so challenging not just for the Christian but for everybody. When the film was over none of us could speak. I was just in floods of tears. This is a warning to all mankind that Jesus is coming back soon....we don't when but he is so we all need to fix up and realize that life is not just on Earth here. This film is deep and should be seen by all....well done Mel Gibson may God Bless You....."
5,"I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years. I've played 6 strings. 12 strings. bass acoustics and electrics. When it comes to acoustic sound. these strings produce the brightest. clearest sound of any string I've ever used. Some strings have a 'bright' sound and some have a clear. distinct tone - not muted or dull. Still. other strings have a rich. full resonance that carries through a room. This is the only string I've ever used that has all of those qualities. In fact. the first time I put these on my acoustic and went to lead worship at my church. several of the church members commented that my guitar sounded 'better than usual' or 'really good' that day. I've tried some other brands since I found these and always end up coming back to them."
1,"Needed to purchase these to power a portable fan. Came well packaged with no damage (from Amazon proper) and the expiration date was years in advance.  Batteries performed as expected. pricing a bit more than 3 hours of continuous power to a portable fan set on &#8220;high&#8221;......  Basically. these are very expensive to use and other types of batteries (re: rechargeable) would be a better purchase although there are just times when only a &#8220;D&#8221; Cell will do.As long as there is no visible damage and your exp. date is ok. these Duracell Alkaline Coppertops should perform well. I have never had any trouble with them over the years."
8,"Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective.  We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb.  No more fleas on the cats. no more fleas on my ankles. no more fleas period.  You'll need one dose per cat per month.  I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time.  This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store.  Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock.  The box was wrinkled. but the contents were in perfect shape.  Paid an excellent price. I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture. and the shipping was free!  Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try."
2,"I bought a sandwich knife years ago. and loved it so much that I wanted another one. I  bought one of these knives and loved it so much that this is my second one.The rubbery substance the handle is made up gives a really secure grip and makes the knife easy to handle. The edge is serrated and will cut through most things that you'd want to cut with a sandwich knife.The blade can hold a lot of jam. mayonnaise. or cream cheese. and lay down a nice thick layer of what you're spreading. but still lets you put a thinner layer if you want.It's the easiest to use sandwich knife I've ever had."
11,"This book is nice because the touch areas are very large. much larger than most touch books on the market.  Two things I don't like...I wish it was longer and had more to touch.  It is about the same length as most touch books out there. though.  My one real complaint is the page with sand.  It talks about the sand being silky on your feet. but the touch part is sandpaper!  How is THAT silky in any way?!  I wish they would have put something else on that page instead.  Overall. it's cute and my 11 month old likes it. which is the most important thing."
9,"The only issue is if it's moved. I have to flip it upside down to 'straighten' it back out. It goes lopsided! But it works great when it's flat (and straightening it out isn't a huge deal). The main purpose was to get my kids something to jump on besides the couch. since that seemed to be a hidden passion of theirs. ;) They love to bounce on it. and so do it! Its a great leg workout. We're all happy for the purchase!"
12,"There are at least 5 missions that cannot be completed without joining the forum. then the Creator's Forum. and a lot of research. downloading. etc.  4 of these defective missions were built by 'Bottman'...someone that should definitely find another occupation.BUT...do not waste your time because the missions are incredibly boring and far from challenging.  The ones they label as 'Hard' are as easy as those labeled 'Easy'.  My 6-year granddaughter could do most of them after 15 minutes of instruction.Do not buy this product.  The GFX are circa 2003. the user interface far from intuitive. and the support abysmal. It's a waste of money & time.Too bad.  Ship.sim 2006 was actually better....AND all the missions worked.  Vstep took one giant step backward."
2,"For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough. After all. a peeler just peels stuff -- so who cares.After trying this at a friend's house while making some soup. I learned the error of my ways. I'll never use one of those cheap things again!This is so comfortable to handle and work with. it made a job that I considered the worst part of the process the easiest! (Why didn't anybody tell me that peeling potatos is not SUPPOSED to be a nightmare?)GREAT little tool! GIANT time-saver! BIG bargain!"
12,"I live in a neighborhood with around 30 children in it. that all play Nintendo. I love Nintendo to no end but these controllers break easily! That is why so many colors and versions of them are sold! The buttons break easily where they no longer work when pressed. especially the L and R buttons. the directional pad also breaks easily where you press up on the pad and it moves left or you press down and it moves left. Because of the handlebars on the side of the controller. that allows the plastic bends quite easily. I have noticed when children get upset or frustrated with a game they twist those handle bars. causing them to break. bend or crack. However a controller is a controller. but for this price you can find something cheaper that is more sturdy and reliable."
5,"The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It is only sized for a standard size guitar pick so if you use small picks or large picks it will not hold your pick. It works well for standard guitar picks and will hold 5 or 6 picks if you like different thickness picks you can have a variety of picks that will store on the guitar or other pick instrument."
12,"This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!"
11,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo. Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from. yeah Amazon!Bananagrams"
1,"My mom has Type 2 diabetics. She began to start throwing up. The doctor confirmed that it was what we thought. She was lactoss intolerant. We greatly reduced the milk products she takes (i.e.. milk. cheese. etc.) and had her take one of these pills before each meal. It worked wonders! And the cost when you subcribe to delivery! CVS charged me about $8.82 for just 32 pills. Now I can get 60 for $12.12 (I think that was the new price since they just went up slightly.) Well worth it folks. Highly recommend. And my mom's sugar as dropped so much her diabetic medicine has been reduced! I never knew that milk had natural sugar in it."
1,"'Sea Bond' denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste. gel. or powder. the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist. I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case. the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However. dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.Jim 'Konedog' Koenig. DDS"
4,"I have no idea how much Hollywood was added to this movie and to what extent the life and times of Ben Carson were glossed over or idealized. What I do know is the movie was emotional. inspiring. powerful and very touching. This is the story of a young boy who overcomes great odds to succeed in life and make a significant contribution to society.It is also a touching story of the love of a mother. her dedication to her two sons and her strong determination to see they had the opportunity to be the very best they could be. This is an excellent movie for the entire family and I strongly recommend it to all."
1,"I enjoy that one soft gel is a serving. For me this was a good value. especially with being 1200mg per serving as opposed to something were you have to swallow 2 or 3 pills for the same serving.This is a very effective form of CLA with Tonalin and for the price it isn't bad. However. if foul smells bother you. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. The bottle I received left such a strong odor in the room long after I took my pill and closed the jar. that I cannot take it out of the house.It's effectiveness and ease to take is great. it just really needs to stop smelling so foul.PROS:Simple to takeEasy on stomachEasy to swallowEffectiveCONS:Bad flavorBad Smell"
8,"This is a durable and soft plush doggie toy - The dogs have a small basket full of toys. but Lambchop is one of their fav's to pick out of the box and tussle around.Has a couple squeaker's - so if that drives you crazy you may want to consider something different.Lambchop has also been machine washed and dried in the dryer (on low temp) several times and survived just fine.I have even purchased them a replacement for when the old one does bite the dust. they will have another -"
9,"This is a really nice pocket knife. hurry and get one before you come down with scurvy!The next time I buy some oranges I'm going to try out this orange peeler blade.The file is nice and the scissors are noticeably better than on the 58mm (smallest) SAKs. and those scissors aren't even all that bad.I think that this may be one of the best compromises in size vs utility - it is very easy to pocket but comes with some nice tools.It is also not a bad choice to pair with a SAK or multi-tool that doesn't come with scissors."
12,"FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world. in fact. it is my whole world.  I play it everyday. but I was always sad. because I had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss FF 7.  But not anymore!  Now. FF 7 is out on the PC. and you have to buy it at any cost. so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time. the experience that is Final Fantasy 7. on your computer!  Just thinking about it is making me tear up a little.  I promise. you will not be disappointed.  The stunning. gut-wrenching visuals. the passionate. heart-wrenching storyline. the exciting. ball-wrenching combat system. the absolutely awe-inspiring characters...nothing could be more perfect.  You have not lived if you have not played this game."
2,"Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately. Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster.  It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous. so make sure to read the safety precautions. Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity. You cannot open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built-in precautionary lock. but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it.Pros:- Stainless steel. You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years.  We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid.- Although not as cheap as we like it to be. if you compare it to other manufacturers. you still save some money.Cons:- The pressure valve rocker. Other pressure cookers (but more expensive) has a  non-removable pressure valve.  It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise."
8,"Frontline worked fine for a while.  But fleas are like viruses.  If everyone in an area uses the same flea treatment then the fleas learn to tolerate it.  This summer a lot of folks around here started complaining the Frontline no longer worked for them.  Unfortunately. it was true of my dog as well.  She is riddled with fleas within the first week after treatment.  If this happens to you I recommend using a cheap Nitenpyram pill.  You can get them on Amazon.  One pill will kill pretty much every flea on your dog. but it only lasts a day. But it will give you time to find another treatment that will work before you house gets overrun.  Lets hope you never get the Super Fleas!"
10,"I purchased this drill because I wanted a powerful 1/2' drill.  I like this drill because its rpm's match its purpose.  I originally purchased the same drill with 2 speeds and the hammmerdrill function.  I thought it was to big and really didn't like worrying about something else to break.  The rpm range is ideal for heavy drilling.  I received the drill. contractor bag and a set of spade bits for $99.00.  I tried the drill out using a 1 inch spade bit through an 8 inch oak branch.  It drilled straight through and never bogged down.  I am glad I got the 7.8 amp drill versus the 6.7 amp drill.  I really recommend this drill."
1,"I only use this aftershave in the summer because it tends to dry my skin in the brutal Chicago winter. It works great after a nice straight razor shave; smells great and cools my skin. It's alcohol-based. but I'm surprised it doesn't sting as much as I expected. Since the dispensing hole is a bit too big. I cover half of it with my thumb before squirting it into my hand. One day. a female acquaintance hugged me and commented I smelled really good. Two weeks later she asked me out ;)"
5,"I originally purchased these strings because of the 11-52 gauges. I wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around 12-54. Upon installing these strings. I can't really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge. but maybe it's too small to notice with the naked eye. I'm not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old DAddario strings that they replaced. They might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new. The guitar that I'm using them on. is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway. so everything sounds nice and smooth. Overall. I'm satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings. but I don't think I'm ready to give up DAddarios yet."
1,"For years I had bottles and other narrow-mouth containers that needed cleaning. I would always find some way to cram a sponge or blast hot soapy water in there. I knew bottle brushes existed. but for some reason I just never got one. Somehow it came to mind to buy one on Amazon. This one is definitely a winner. It doesn't scratch like the cheap little ones my mom has. The long bristles and slightly flexible wand mean it can really clean just about anything very thoroughly. Just don't accidentally mix it up with a toilet bowl brush."
6,"I got this new mouse pad/wrist rest when I got my new trackball mouse. I had read the reviews and I was impressed by the reviews that said the gel did not compress like the foam types.So far. my expectations have been met. The wrist rest is comfortable and it does not compress like my old foam one did.Being as I use a trackball. I did have one problem. My trackball mouse slid all over the pad when I pressed a button. I would expect that to be good news for people who use the traditional roll around type of mouse.My solution was to buy a set of those round non-slip jar openers for the kitchen. One of them under my mouse completely solved the slipping problem.I like this mouse pad/wrist rest so much that I bought a gel pad wrist rest for my keyboard. They are both great!"
12,"Originality 10/10 Unlike nearly all other RPG franchises. this is 100% original!Graphics 9+/10 Some Pokemon look better than others.Music 9.5+/10 The music is very good.Replay value 10/10 Even if you get through this game in hours. you may have more to do.Pokemon Red sold 4.83 million in the United States. so this qualifies as an underrated game. due to selling under 5 million units. If you want to buy the best Game Boy game ever. this is where you will find it. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS! This should have gotten a 'Game Of The Year' reward or two. but this (near) perfect masterpiece NEVER got it. A true Pokemon fan has this gem in his/her collection. However. one thing. Some of these might be worn out (discolored label. multiple scratches on the back. etc.) due to being so great of a game. Don't say I didn't warn you."
12,"This is the best fighting game I've ever played and best for multiple players.  There are 8 regular characters plus 4 secret ones. each with over a dozen different moves.  There are 8 regular battle arenas (themed after the 8 characters) and 1 secret one.  Starting with three basic moves and playing with another novice. you can master all of the characters and all of their moves.  This game is unfortunately rigidly divided by skill. and good players will consistently beat worse ones.  I recommend this for everyone. especially those who enjoy games that require quick descisions."
11,"This is a pretty fun group game. but can drag a bit with multiple players. This is because people want to calculate their moves on the board before committing to the best possible route.  A fun variation we like to play is that when you start your turn. you declare your gear and then roll.  Once you roll. you 'drive' the car the necessary moves.  No take backs. no do overs.  This encourages players to pay attention to their car when it is not their turn. and also adds and element of hazard that would be present in a real driving\racing situation.  Makes a good party game. but you may want to limit games to one lap per game."
6,"How bad can a mouse pad be?  That's what I thought....First. be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad.  Basically. it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32' foam pad.  Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads. but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides. and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad isn't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it.  It is very distracting.Finally. the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it.  VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles. so 2 stars."
6,"There is no doubt that more people are choosing to get mobile phones for whenever they need to call up. as well as cordless phones for mobile use at home. But there are still those of us whom would just rather prefer the need of just having a simple phone for one place in the house to call. That is the case with AT&T;'s 210 Corded Phone. This is a very simple and easy to use phone that works for just about anyplace in the house. where you want to keep your calls stationery. I also found it to be very easy to read and understand. and rings louder than my cordless handsets in need of a call to home. If you really are looking for a extra phone for the home or the office. than I definitely recommend this classic phone from AT&T.;Price: B+Convience: BOverall: B 1/2+"
11,"Party Gras is a great party game.  Players can range from teens to lively adults.  The game comes packaged in a clear. durable plastic tote bag versus the typical game box.  The plastic case makes it easy to transport from one party to the next.  The bright. festive. eye-catching colors is what drew me to this game.  I think that most groups of 4 or more will enjoy playing this game if the participants are outgoing and have a good sense of humor.  This game is not for introverts or for someone seeking a high educational value from a game.  Party Gras is a great ice breaker. good humorous family/friend fun. and a welcomed change from board games that keep you seated.  Start the holidays and new year off with something different...Party Gras.  If you tire of this game. just find another person that likes games and do an exchange."
9,"These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself. I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid's sized. but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing. The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight. and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically. The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an 'okay' job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents. I'll never be buying these again. nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children....(in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them.)"
10,"I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting. They are used in the under-cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter. About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs. This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably (lower currents in the system means less wear and tear. so the speak). But they still burn out. These bulbs are a perfect replacement. They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs. but the difference is barely noticeable. I give them a thumbs-up."
9,"I've had experience with Victorinox Swiss Army knives for over 40 years.  My primary casual pocket knife has been the Swiss Army 'Mechanic' for over 20 of those years.  I've always been satisfied with the quality. and with the fine edge you can achieve with the Victorinox stainless steel.  This knife is no exception. Same fine quality.  A little large to comfortably carry in my pocket. but a problem easily remedied with the available Victorinox Cordura Belt Pouch for Swiss Army Knives. Two of the most useful features of this knife are the scissors and the pliers.  Of course you also have the available screwdrivers. as well as all the other features.  It's amazing how handy this knife has been.  There have been times. when I don't have the knife with me. that I find myself reaching for it to perform a certain task. and then. &#34;Drats. I wish I had it with me.&#34;"
10,"I've used the Jorgensen Bar Clamps for years. Bought some other clamps as they were cheaper.  Over the years I know when I am picking up a Jorgensen Clamp.  Fit and finish does well in my workshop which rusts tools! Needed a good vise. It was highly rated and I am impressed by the company. Have yet to install it but it looks well made and it is sturdy.Down side is they need to have a better set of instructions. Can't find anything when I Google it. Some You Tube Videos by ambitious woodworkers. but companies should be doing it!"
4,"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen. i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible. which is a huge blessing. iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews. it's a wonderful. and great piece. strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner  of the screen. 'jehovah our heavenly father. the alpha and omega of my life. bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for  saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN'...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."
6,"I haven't used this a lot yet. but. based on my fairly small sample of experience. this product is a lot stronger than other mounting tape I've tried.  We used it putting up posters at a fundraising event and it did an outstanding job - even on a brick wall.  It gripped the wall and the posters very well.  It didn't take a great deal of length to hold bulky and moderately heavy posters.  Pretty much exactly what you're looking for from a product like this."
6,"These are general use return address/locate labels. 2 inch by 4 inches.  I checked MS word and MS works and Avery provided the Avery template numbers. so they worked well with all my applications without the need for me to download the templates from the the Avery website. And. of course. Avery was the industry leader in labels from the beginning. so you can not loose buying these.  And the TrueBlock really works.  I took one of the blank labels and pasted it on the dark blue folder the lables come in.  No blue shows through. it is pure white.."
11,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America.earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
6,"Packaging says that the mouse pad is 50% pre-consumer recycled content. and that the packaging card is 100% post-consumer recycled material.Seems like a decent mouse pad and it'll fit my needs. I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently. I don't mean to slight a product because of it's color. but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey."
3,"During the wholes series I was and I am a fan of DJ. I love the way she treats her friends and helps them. Even love her bad habbits :-).What I did not like was the way this story was going. Quinn isn't able to stand a woman. who is standing on her own feet and not fearing to fight for herself? Does he really need to make her small to fell great. feel like a man?For me this book is pushed high. You must know Susan Mallory offers her readers in the US free books 14 days before publishing and they have to write a review to be in the next round for a free book."
8,"I have an 8-pound toy poodle whose passion is fetching balls.  Her mouth is so small she could not get the regular chuckit ball in her mouth and carry it very far.  I ordered this mini-chuckit and though the ball is a little bigger than her very small balls. it works fine and she catches it in her mouth as it's heading toward earth. I have noticed that this mini-chuckit hurles the ball much farther than the regular. which is great because she loves to go far to fetch it.  We use this launcher several times a day and we never get tired of it.  The ball it came with got trashed within a month so I bought Tuff Balls to replace it.  We absolutely love this launcher.  It's fabulous for the beach.  You can't go wrong with this if your little toy dog loves fetching."
1,"We have 3 of these. and have been pleased since the beginning (about 3 years ago). Your mouth will feel wonderful after each use (though it takes a bit of getting used to. and beginners are warned to use the included damping ring to decrease the intensity for a while). We have had 2 occasions to return one to the factory. but they were replaced under warranty with little fuss (both dead batteries). There have been subtle changes as newer models have come out. I like this latest itineration best. as its tiny green LED on the on/off switch makes an adequate navigational beacon through a dark bathroom. One word of caution: my family will not travel without these things. so while I preach 'pack light'. they tote their Sonics everywhere we go. Fortunately. one charge lasts at least a week. so the charging base is only needed on extended trips."
11,"I don't know why my expectations were so low on this product. Frankly. I've been playing RPGs since I was 14 which would be the summer of 1979. Back then RPGs products were crap. I recently decided it would be fun to play some of these games again so I picked up this because I really liked the theme of it and the videos FFG did really won me over. Overall this screen is well made (boardgame quality construction for the screen) and the content of information on it is perfect for anyone not familiar with the conventions of this game which will be about 90% of their customers since so much of it appears to be new.If you have an android device or iOS get the FFG dice roller as well. Its MUCH cheaper than the physical dice!Star WarsTM Dice"
1,"I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy. wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation. itching. skin staining. clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again. it's just wasting money."
10,"This blade cuts very smooth with no splintering. I use this on my Delta 12' lazer chop saw for finish work. I had one of these for years and had it resharpened until the teeth could be sharpened no more. I replaced it with a Forest chop saw blade bucause I use Forest on most of my other saws and they work great but the Forest blade would not make the smooth cuts I needed so I went back to this Freud balde. I have been woodworking for over 40 years and in my openion. this is the blade to use for finish work. There are other blades out there that will equal the performance of this blade but not at this price!"
10,"I've had the opportunity to use many different belt sanders over the years. This one is hands down the best one you can buy. Superb engineering. and design. coupled with flawless manufacturing produces this gem. You simply can't go wrong with this sander. I especially like the variable speed feature. This thoughtful feature makes it possible to adjust your at load speeds which helps with softer material. An architect friend and I have used these sanders on many materials including wood. The 3X21 model is this boys little brother. which I found to be a benefit when I need to work upside down. If you're looking for a belt sander. this one will keep you happy."
5,"I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables.  If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound. this might not be the cable for you.HOWEVER. for the price and purpose this a five star cable.  The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection. but also feel sturdy and secure.  The gold plating ensures a solid connection.What I like most about this cable is that it's guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement... or so their packaging claims.  I have not had to replace mine."
3,"Ok so I do enjoy a Maya Banks book but found this one a little disappointing.This is a pretty standard romance storyline albeit with a m&eacute;nage twist- men don't know what they have. lose it. figure out they want what they lost. win the girl. everyone is happy.This book was enjoyable though I was a little disappointed with how fast our heroine gives in.  I skipped over most of the sex scenes because I was still annoyed about how fast she capitulated- though most were pretty steamy.This is definitely a good read. especially if you just want to switch off and relax."
9,"These are very nice quality rubber bases.  They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time.  They are perfect for a trip to the park.  t-ball. baseball etc.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage.  The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light).  It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store. haul. carry these around.  Otherwise - they are very useful!"
11,"The kids love this guy BUT the programing is not easy. The buttons are a little bit tricky to press and for my 8 year old. it was confusing. Once I programmed it. we had a good time with it. It is great for talking about measuring and basic ideas of computer programing. If only you could program it from a PC... seems like it would not be too difficult to add a USB interface of some kind.If I could give 3.5 stars I would. If it was a little less difficult. it would get 5 stars. For a 10-12 year old. it may be just right."
9,"In my humble opinion. the best supertool around. and I own probably two dozen of them that I've collected over the years. The tool exhibits a fit and finish better than anything else out there. and one great feature is that the tools fold out from the outside of the handle. It featured a positive locking mechanism when most of the other tools still had yet to offer it. including the famous Leatherman. Even with all the innovative multitools of recent years with each new one trying to outdo the other. this took remains head and shoulders above the rest. Next to this. as with a previous reviewer. I would rate the Leatherman Supertool as best."
1,"For most people. that's what you will need these for.  And once that stupid thing starts beeping at 3 AM (I swear its programmed in that way by some sadist at Big Smoke Detector). you are going to want to have a 9 volt ready.  Because you are not the kind of monster who would let your family burn to death (well probably smoke to death if we are honest) cause you were too cheap or lazy to replace the battery.  That's not how you want to get on the local news (that or &#34;local cat hoarder in Guinness Book of World Records&#34;).Given that these have the &#34;Durablock&#34; feature they have a long guaranteed shelf life. so feel free to splurge on this 4 pack of 9 volts.  You will be safe. and feel like a big spender."
5,"This case it built really well. it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck. it DOES have a lock on one of the latches. The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry. Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it.Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly... as it should! hehe."
5,"I've used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel. sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you can't go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them."
10,"I use this tool weekly and it's well made as most Dewalt tools are.  This saw can be found elsewhere including the stand for less money.  A MAJOR FAULT in the design of this tool is when you go to switch blades or reposition the blade whole doing delicate scroll work is that the arm will not stay up and you have to find a 2x4 or something to hold it in the up position!!!  I have heard that there is some sort of retrofit available to solve this problem but can't find it.  Otherwise this is a great tool!"
9,"I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress. but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together. but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches. and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve. but it's a small price to pay for light weight. portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat. I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all. neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak. but for the comfort. it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in..."
6,"I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back. I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits (you know. the ones with the syringes?). Both ruined my printer. after awhile. They seem to work initially. but you can tell the colors are off. Sure. the generic inks are so much cheaper. but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink. Trust me on this one. buy Canon OEM cartridges!"
1,"I had the older version of this from a couple of years back. and that older one felt stronger - and is still going strong. I got this one for my husband. and I did not like it nearly as much. The water tends to splatter more than my old one. and the vibration is bigger but not deeper.For the price I paid. though. it was fine. I just can't justify giving it 5 stars when it doesn't add up to the quality of its previous versions."
10,"Bought this router with the idea of using it in a table exclusively. I Figured it would be too heavy for using it without a table. but I was wrong: the smooth slowstart feature and the router having no vibration makes it easily controlled.I did end up mounting it in a table and it works great with large style and rail cutters.I compared this against the larger DeWalt. but this one won based on price. As to performance. they are probably equal.If you need a larger router for a good price. get this one."
1,"What can I say? Metemucil works. not only to prevent constipation but also to prevent the runs. Our GI doc actually prescribed it years ago to slow down the works.If you check the labels. Metamucil has more soluble fiber that any other supplement I could find. Cheaper too.Since we use one cannister almost monthly the subscribe & save is great. If you drink it in about 10 oz. water quickly. it does not get mushy. Just don't let it sit for any length of time.It is GF. has no MSG or related products or aspartates."
10,"Replaced my standard router base with this D-handle for better control when routing dovetails using a dovetail jig. Just one thing to keep in mind is the cord on a standard base 690 is too long for use with this handle. There is no good way to manage the extra cord so I shortened my cord on the router and will use an extension cord if I need to use the fixed base again. It was easy to remove the cover on the router and shorten the cord or you could just cut the cord to length and add a new plug if you are nervous about getting inside the router."
6,"This is 200 sheets of wide rules filler paper.  It has three holes punched for your binder.  The lines don't fade or smudge as some lesser filler papers are prone to do.  It is crisp. clean. white. smudgeproof. and looks and performs like the best papers in the world. at a reasonable price.  I like to get 200 sheets in a package as this is a generous size but not so much that I have to store a lot of excess paper on a shelf where it can get dusty.  Mead makes great office supplies from the ones I've been seeing lately."
10,"I own multiple DeWalt products (Drills. Table Saws. etc.) and have had great experiences with them all....that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw.  Love the saw. hate the lamp.  The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration.  Further. unless you are working in pitch black. the provided light bulb doesn't provide ample work light. that is if you can screw it in.  The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight. it is almost impossible to change.  What a let down.  I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher....."
10,"I love power ! This tool delivers boat loads of it. But you know what ? It doesn't sound like it. I was never able to use a belt sander before without earplugs. This one runs at only 84 Db. It's the quietest on the market. It's also the smoothest I've used.I've used all of the 4x24 sanders and the Makita just seems to do more work faster. Maybe it's the fact that it has the highest speed of any . maybe it's the high tech . powerful motor .the efficient drive train. Whatever it is . it kicks butt . The dust collection system is also top notch. For small jobs and fine work . I prefer my Bosch 1274 dvs. It's much lighter .compact and easy to control. For extended use or heavy sanding though . you cannot beat this tool."
1,"These are great band aids but they are not sticky enough. i have tried other Band-Aid brand type of band aids but these can be sticker. I used these for my elbow area and these always came out. They stick better on other parts of your body but anywhere that has movement. these are not going to work well. I did like the assortment though and the number of band aids but definitely not for areas that have movement because from my experience. they come off easily.The other issue i had was that was with ointment. like neosporin. these tend to slide of sometimes. So again with the sticky issue.I tried using these while i worked out at the gym and they came off easily from sweat.Overall they are average band-aids but they are not for areas that move or people that work out due to their lack of stickiness."
5,"I've used the .60mm and .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks during my entire professional music career.  I rock hard. Acoustic. electric. and Bass!  I've tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break. and once you find the thickness that fits your needs. you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip. I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming. Maybe 5 times in my entire career.  Buy these picks."
6,"This stuff works really well.  I only put on things that I plan on leaving up for a long time/permanently - so unfortunately. I can't comment on stuff left up for longer than 6 months since I just got it ( maybe update later).  For temporary items. I use the temporary 'command' strips from 3M which allows me to peel stuff off walls without damage.  This product is supposed to be permanent. so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls.  I use it to hold a metal towel hook to wood drawer."
3,"K.A. Mitchell is my favorite M/M author. her ability to create realistic characters is amazing.  I love that in this story both men would be what I would call Alpha types. even though it's primarily Jeff in charge. Ryan also steps up.  Very realistic storyline. Jeff can't let out that he's gay for fear of losing the time he has with his daughter. Ryan was in the Air Force so he's been in that same scenario where he has to hide that part of him. The sex scenes this author writes are incredibly descriptive & erotic; makes me feel a little like a voyeur!I do agree with the other reviewers that the book does end abruptly and hope the story is continued.What I didn't like: 2/3 of the book is the story. the last 1/3 of the kindle book is advertisements for other books to read/buy.  So very short story. but still a great quick read that I feel was worth the price."
3,"How anyone could possibly complain about getting the original 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the succeding 13 sequels with one click for 95 cents is beyond me. My 10 year old read a paperback copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' as part of an over-the-summer reading assignment prior to entering the 5th grade. He enjoyed it very much. as I did a long time ago>  When I told him that there were 2 or 3 sequels. he was surprised ('Why didn't they make them into movies too. Dad?') and asked for them.  When I looked them up on Amazon *I* was surprised to find out that there were 13 of them and that I could get them all for my Kindle for $0.95. Click and I had them. and Jacob has read the first 3 or 4. and now I have to fight him for my Kindle.  A better buy you will never make.Highly RecommendedJM Tepper"
10,"This is a very heavy duty saw. I bought it to help with installations in my kitchen cabinet business and it is an excellent tool. I saw on some reviews that there were problems changing the blades. it really is technique; to remove the blade after you press the release lever you must twist the blade left and right and pull out of the socket. it is a tight fit in the slot and the lock exerts a lot of pressure so you have to twist it out. I have been using this saw for the last 6 years. I have no complaints and I am happy I have it. It cuts straight and square and the orbital feature works like a dream when you need to cut really thick pieces of lumber thanks to the 6 amp motor. It works great too when you have to cut delicate pieces as well. I will recommend it to anyone who wants a quality tool."
10,"This is a reasonably priced. good quality. seven inch diameter. wool buffing and polishing pad.  It is pretty thick and deep. and has a 3/4 inch diameter hole in the middle.  The pad is designed to be secured by the hook and loop system.  `Hook and loop' is a generic term for Velcro type fastening.  One advantage of hook and loop is that you can change pads quickly.If you have concerns about the reliability of hook and loop. the system is reasonably secure.  The `hooks' on your buffing wheel. need to be in good condition. and not damaged or bent up.  The `loops' are the fuzzy part on the back of the pad.  Push the pad and wheel together. and give them a little twist to make sure there is a good `bite'.  Test run the buffer at low speed and see how it feels.  If it seems secure. you can gradually increase the speed and pressure."
3,"I was eager to read this novel and downloaded it at the time it was 0.99. Big spender I know but I am glad I did not spend more. I was intrigued by the concept and some of the scenes of college life are both surreal and funny. Though that is all the positives I have for this meandering book. I mean there is no Jekyll Hide scenario. no ON/OFF if you will. Its like the whole book is more off than on. there is one speed and it is slow. Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective. but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny. but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me."
3,"Recently stating that I very seldom find a 5 star book. I have now read 2 in a row. Naturally I'm pleased! I have read Stephanie Bond before but nothing as good as this book. Hero is reviewing a hotel recently bought by a big corporation. He stays at the hotel without the manager's. Cindy aka heroine. knowledge. HILARIOUS happenstances start on the first page and continue throughout the book. Cindy is hard working. lovable. and accident prone; but a good hotel manager. Eric (hero) is there to do a hatchet job on the hotel. he's crazy about the heroine and wants to pad the report. but does not. Chemistry is great between the H/h.... naturally needed in a good romance. and the humor is top notch. Great..Great..Read. I highly recommend this book and I thank Ms. Bond for the entertainment."
1,"I ordered this a year ago for my grandmother who has arthritis & bruises easily.  Once she tried it. there was no other alternative that worked as good for her (she was using other topical creams & some burned her skin. or left a rash).  This soaks in quickly. doesn't burn or irritate the skin & actually does lighten her bruises within a couple days of using this day & night (she bumps into anything & a bruise starts. Immediately she puts this on & the bruise either doesn't happen or it fades away in a couple days).Now I am ordering again because I use this before & after workouts. when I get bruises and also to ease out the swelling & redness of acne on my face (yes. just 2 times a day on clean skin I rub this in & within a week my large. angry acne marks are gone).This stuff works quickly on pain. doesn't stain. is all natural & we could not be happier in my home using this product."
3,"Some editing issues and odd word usage... also a little contrived and heavy handed in spots.That said. despited a feeling of redundancy. I very much enjoyed this bundle as well as the fourth book. Dark Wolf Rising.HOT! HOT! HOT! Even if most of it is all tease! lolThese stories definitely got my motor running.I liked the characters. and the sub-plot running throughout the four books (though it was less of a factor in the fourth book.)The resistance/aversion push/pull is an effective device but I would have liked a bit more variation. One slightly annoying feature was how often a character decided to &#34;Go for it&#34; only to NOT go for it shortly thereafter.Still... I enjoyed them."
4,"There is nothing 'real' or 'realistic' about Gibson's portrayal of violence in this movie. It is. quite simple. an orgiastic celebration of pain and suffering. See the bad guys sneer and laugh as the blood splatters their faces with full Dolby sound effects! In many ways the violence in 'Kill Bill' is more subtle than this. Regardless of its historical accuracy (who cares?). this piece of celluloid is nothing more than one opinionated director's desperate--and unintelligent--flagellation of the audience. For the time capsule called. 'The Dumbing of America.' save room for this ridiculously overblown religious treatise that cheapens. not celebrates. the life of Christ. Pure drivel."
4,"The Passion of the Christ was much-hyped when it was released in 2004. Mel Gibson who wrote and directed this film took a lot of heat. critics said this epic was a direct insult to Jewish people. I watched this film a few years ago and this film is violent but I don't think the point of view takes aim at any religion in particular. I think every religion had a part in the horrible death of Jesus Christ. This film uses sub-titles so get ready to read dialogue. James Caviezel is a splendid actor. hope he continues to make more incredible films in the future. Mel Gibson may have been used as punching bag but you can't ignore the brilliance of this controversial drama."
5,"Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S.G. It worked out perfectly . I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years. Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also. I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings . You just can't go wrong. I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them."
4,"WOW this is a DVD?!?The show is as it was in the TV release and the extras do bring it to the modern day but I think they (Sony Wonder/Golden Books) could have packed all the shows on One DVD instead of making you buy  3 of them... Look to Warmer Bros. Year w/o Santa Claus...Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Frosty could have made it all in this DVD... Well I got it in the collection and saved some over buying them one at a time...Enjoy the show and worry where the popcorn money will come from later..."
5,"I have 7 guitars in my cramped little bedroom studio and I quickly ran out of space to hold them easily. Floor space is dominated by my desk and drum set and I wanted my guitars to be out of the way and safe so they didn't get tripped over or dinged. Enter the String swing.I have 7 of them and I have hung everything from a Fender bass to a takamine acoustic with no trouble.The Y headstock holder pivots to accommodate asymmetrical headstocks like a Stratocaster. Just slip your headstock into it and the weight of the guitar finds it's own center of gravity.The base plate is an attractive open wood grain and looks like hickory. I didn't use the supplied wall anchors and instead drilled directly into wall studs.These are well worth the cost."
3,"This is the story of Devin. a skittish diva who is running from love and Erik. the man hell bent on chasing her crazy behind until she admits she loves him and is ready to move their relationship to the next level. I LOVED this short story to pieces!!!Erik is in love with Devin and has asked her to move in with him. Devin. afraid of living the hellish life her parents lived. is gun shy when it comes to commitment and decides moving in with Erik is going too far too fast so she dumps him.The chase and capture is funny as all get out! Devin finally relents under what I can only describe as the sexiest. most sensually erotic siege it has ever been my honor to behold. I wish I could give this more stars.Well done!**BEST READ: with a glass of Blackberry Merlot and chocolate dipped strawberries! Have your little black book handy. you might need to call in reinforcements LOL!!!"
8,"We've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch. Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch. I have to give it everything I've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts. my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go. Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY!! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort. My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs! The product comes with one 'Chuckit' ball but also works with standard tennis balls (which I recommend). The Chuckit balls aren't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water."
3,"This is a fun book to read.  I really enjoyed reading it how ever there was not a whole lot of plot or depth to the story.  It is more of a short story then a full book.  There was plenty of sex but not much else.  When I finished it. my first thought was 'Is that all there is?'. The extra part of the story added onto the authors website is nice but I have to admit I am still disappointed in this book.  I did notice on her website it states this is a novella. which would have been helpful information to have on the kindle.I would like to think there will eventually be more to this story. but considering it was published over 2 years ago I doubt it.  If you are looking for a quick read this is good but don't expect much out of it."
8,"Ok So I have used this product for the past two months and it is not working. I don't know why. it appears to be in the exact same box as the one you would get from your local vet. I know it says it takes at most 18 hours to take affect. Well It has been 10 days since my last application and I just had 3 F****** fleas jump off my little chihuahua and onto me. I am not happy about this at all. I only paid about $20 less than what I would have paid at the vets office. WHAT'S THE DEAL????Is this S*** fake ?????????????????I don't usually do reviews if the product is good. but when it is bad I do because I don't want anyone else wasting their money!!!JUST GO TO YOUR VET TO GET THIS. For some unknown reason this just isn't working and I am frustrated."
10,"I don't know why I waited so long -- I purchased this to do my basement -- makes doing any sheetrock job -- especially ceilings -- exceedingly easier than doing it the old way with a cordlesss drill and dimpler bit.It takes a little practice to get used to how fast you can work with this. but even taking your time loading screws. it sets them at a perfect depth everytime which saves a HUGE amount of time in the long run when mudding.I'm holding back 1 star to see how well the tool holds up over time. but 25% of the way into my basement project. I'm extremely pleased with its performance."
11,"I am really enjoying playing this game. When I first heard about descent they were no longer in print. Later hearing about the second edition I was very excited.The production is excellent and the rules although a bit much at first are quite easy to learn. They are even easier to teach to someone. Weapons. spells and overload powers are really fun. The art work on the tile sets allows you to be fully taken into the experience.Games are also around an 1-2 hours and are nicely broken up into two acts for making it easier for groups with time constraints.If you are into dungeon board games. then his is for you."
11,"This game is really fun. and not that difficult to learn. Only takes a couple of games to figure it out. and the games are usually less than 30 minutes.The game is 2 player. and it has a defense / offense type strategy with the corporation being the defensive player trying to score agendas. and the hacker being the offense player trying to hack and steal the agendas. There is also an element of deck building.Very fun. would recommend buying some sleeves to protect the cards. Can't wait to check out the expansions."
11,"I like the Scene It games pretty much. The premise is similar to a Trivial Pursuit type of experience. but with 2 changes. One. all ages can play (with an older helper to read. use the remote. etc.) and two. the 'questions' sometimes involve watching a 'scene' (hence the name Scene It!!) and answering questions about that.The kids think that the dvd part is amazing! They love watching the scene and trying to guess what the question might be. I think it is kind of cool myself! Still. sometimes the game gets slightly long for younger children. My family does have fun playing this game. but it is one where you don't want to immediately play over again when it is done."
11,"This kit is really cool.  It comes with little tracer designs and a backup LED light so you can place all your parts where you want them and then trace your design.  Then you can finish up with cool colors. accents. details. etc.  You can make anything from a family SUV-type to a racecar to a Bug to everything in between.  My kid spent days taking personal requests and then lovingly designing a custom car for everyone in the family.  The final results are very high-quality too!  I definitely recommend this pack."
3,"I was not disappointed. sometimes sad. sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages. I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past. but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale. a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and can't wait to start on them. (I went for the freebies so don't know how the 3.00 plus books would be.) formating.english etc. may be better."
1,"Pros:  Does a great job of cleaning teeth. and it's easy and comfortable to use.However. it's not without problems.  First off. mine has developed cracks around the handle that are *slowly* propogating through the plastic.  Never dropped the thing or treated it roughly - it just started cracking after a month or two.  I'll have to hope they cover it under warranty if it finally falls apart.My main complaint. however. is the lack of easily replaceable batteries (note that the Braun and Interplak are guilty of this as well).  It seems horribly obnoxious - as well as environmentally irresponsible - to charge this much for a product that's going to have to be thrown away after a couple of years when the NiCd's go.  Instead of a ... battery. you're stuck buying another ... toothbrush...yeesh."
4,"Although I will never watch it again. I was glad that I went to see this powerful movie.  It accurately portrays Jesus' last tortured hours on planet earth.  I give kudos to Gibson. who was brave enough to finance this movie himself. amidst much controversy.  I would encourage all to watch this movie. at least one time. to understand why throughout the ages. thousands have been willing to die for their belief in a man called Jesus Christ.Yes. this movie is violent. but this world is violent. and Jesus did not come to escape the realities of this world. but to share in our sufferings."
10,"I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said 'Drywall and Deck' Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill."
8,"I have tried numerous bones and chew toys without success. My 90 lb Lab/Pit mix is a heavy chewer who has destroyed just about everything I gave him. Even the heavy rubber Black Kong Extreme he was able to conquer. I ordered the Galileo Bone based on many positive reviews. Initially I thought the price was high. $14.00 bucks for a dog bone? This thing is huge and will outlast 10 cheaper ones. My dog loved it! It has a chicken flavor that made it irresistible. He chewed it for over an hour straight barely making a mark in it. This bone will last a long time and is worth the price."
1,"Ignore the positive reviews for these batteries folks.  Better you should trust the negative comments and save yourself the hassle of returning dead batteries.  I should have known when they arrived that something was wrong:  They were shipped in a generic clamshell-type package with no label or indication they were made by Duracell - not at all as pictured and a red flag for fakes.  Note to seller:  How long did you think you'd get away with selling dead (and possibly fake) batteries?  Note to Amazon:  Please investigate this seller!"
6,"FIrst. before you order these. pay attention to the dimensions listed in the description.  These are RETURN address labels -- the small ones you stick in the corner of the envelope -- NOT the usually-larger address labels that contain the address where you want your letter to go.  They are. therefore. SMALLER than address labels.  Don't order these expecting to get larger labels.  :-)That said. these are excellent quality. print easily in my inkjet printer. and. as the package says. are easy to peel off the backing sheet.  I used one of the templates I got from the Avery website (I'm on a Mac. using Microsoft Word for the Mac). and designed some nice-looking labels.  Don't expect to fit more than 3 lines of small print on each label.  Like I said. these are small."
10,"I bought the Bosch belt sander because. at the time. it had the best warranty. I planned to sand all the peeling paint off my 1 1/2 story clapboard house and repaint it. I thought that I'd go through at least two of these sanders. I bought the belts by the case and spent several weeks sanding the house. I'd run this thing until it overheated and stopped. I'd let it cool down and go at it again. To my surprise. I completed the job and the original Bosch sander was still working good as new. I later found out that this sander is good for more delicate work. I have more control and it seems to lay flatter. It eventually died (smoke poured out of the motor)and I replaced it with a Makita sander. a very robust and dependable unit. Over all. I'd prefer the Bosch for finer finishing work and ease of use."
6,"The best way to go with these business cards is to download the free Avery Design Pro software. Using this program. one can create a wide variety of business cards to satisfy virtually anyone.These cards do have a matte finish which is more conservative in appearance than the glossy or semi-glossy stock that is also available from Avery. They take color nicely and look very professional with their smooth edge.The cards break loose easily and dry quickly. It is usually wise to let them sit for a few minutes before stacking them.I am very pleased with the business cards that have been produced from this product and can recommend them to anyone wanting to exercise creativity in the design of their business cards."
9,"I think Casio under prices this watch. I have purchased watches from Nike and some of the other expensive brands and this Casio is still my favorite. The low profile makes it wearable every day. It says it is water resistant. but I have gone to the lake and swimming with this watch and never had any water issues. The back light is not as bright as some other brands but I am glad it is not because this helps the battery last longer and it is bright enough to see it. The watch is very user friendly for first timers. You can not beat a watch like this. especially when it is a quarter of the price of other watches."
11,"We got this for our family for Christmas and it was great. The game has a similar feel to Settlers. but isn't quite as cut-throat. so it's easier to get through a game without people feeling frustrated at each other. I can see why this game has won so many awards. I also love that it comes with three extra train pieces of each color so to account for pieces ever getting lost. The only thing we didn't like was that all the cards are very small (about 2 1/2&#34; tall) making it very hard to shuffle them)."
9,"First off. these amplify ALL sounds. so they are useless in a factory where there are constant noises echoing from a distance.When I walk on concrete. my FOOTSTEPS get isolated by these headphones. and the phones mute for almost a half second EVERY step. I cant even hear myself walk WITHOUT these on. They are hot and not exactly UNcomfortable. but you feel much better NOT wearing them.To top it off. I got it at the last GoldBox deal. and I was *NOT* sent the '7S' model I paid $99.99 for. I was sent this 6S model that retails for exactly $79 on Amazon. and I didnt notice until 5 weeks later."
10,"I mainly purchased these to replace the standard thrust washer that came with my tablesaw. So with that in mind. they work great.  As for the stabilizer part. I don't think they add much for standard kerf blades. or at least I don't notice any  appreciable difference.  I don't use thin kerf blades as a general rule so I can't speak to their usefulness while using thin kerf blades.I hadn't really intended on using both pieces when I ordered them. again intended to replace the thrust washer. One added benefit that I didn't think about is that it shifts the blade over. in my case. to the right.  Now I can reuse some of my old chewed up zero clearance inserts!I do only use the outside stabilizer with my dado set."
9,"I didn't buy the scope for the case or the stand I was looking for a good mid-range spotting scope that is what my review is for. I shoot 100yds. with a marlin wmr 22 and I can see my shots on paper very good.I also shoot a Savage axis at 200 yds. and can still see my holes in targer. for someone that does bird watching or simular hobbies this is a very good scope for the price. I could read the lettering on a building that was at least 1200 yds. away 12' letters."
4,"I saw this film last night. although they portray Christ in the typical Western stereotype. it was an intense film. There is a moment in the film where you'd have to be inhuman not to cry. This scene is between Mary and Jesus as he is being forced to carry the cross up a mountain and he falls down and she runs to him. she has a flashback of him as a child falling down while she is running to him...People all around me in the theater were crying. I have never heard people applaud a film when it was over. Actually some people were praying when the film was over.It isn't just hype. the film is highly emotional and disturbing. It isn't the crucifixion that disturbed me. it was the flogging they gave him before he was crucified...If you want to see it. see it on the biggest movie screen available...I think the storm at the end should have been more intense though. I give it 3 1/2 stars."
10,"My Porter-Cable gets a lot of use and the pad will eventually loose it's &#34;grip&#34;.  When using the sander one should not use excessive pressure as I think this is the reason the pads will fail after about a year of heavy use.  Believe it or not. I get impatient and apply too much pressure which I believe develops excessive heat causing the velcro to fail.  When this happens. the sand paper will only loosely attach only to fly off.  Then it is time to put on a new one.  For the price of a replacement. I'll gladly fork over the dough to get away from the old stick backed sanding discs."
8,"Are you sick and tired of picking up slobbery. wet. drool dripping tennis balls? Then the answer to your problems is in the Chuck It. I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog. It's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground. It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it didn't just fly into the ground (I put too much arm swing into it). This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean. The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also. depending on the size of your dog. It also comes in a variety of colors. Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them!If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls. or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you!"
5,"This is actually the first capo I have ever owned. as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. That being said. I paid close to $14 with free shipping for this capo. and I feel it is a good value. It feels well constructed. like it won't break if I drop it. The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings. Ample padding mitigates any marring of the guitar's neck. The spring mechanism is plenty tight. but not too tight to easily move or remove the capo single handed. even while playing. The capo is sleek looking. and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3&#34; x 3&#34;. but I have no frame of reference for comparison.Item was shipped on time. and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging. Part number: 83CB. Made in USA! No counterfeit here. If you have any questions. feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO"
6,"If the size is very important for you. check the photo of the box first. The description by Amazon lists these as 1-1/4. however the box actually lists 1-1/16.Even then. really the usable size is closer to just 1'.We needed super large clips at the office. and measured that 1-1/4 would be just perfect. however with the actual usable bit measuring in at 1'. we're having some problems making them work.Granted. they do work great. but the item description was misleading online. and the actual stated capacity is also stretching it a little.Durability is great as usual. though unusual warping may occur due to the larger size. Harder to open to the full 1' size."
9,"This is great for baking it just takes some getting used to.  Cookies and turnovers get over cooked unless turned.As for the reviewers who complain about the handle getting hot.  Just buy the lodge signature series with stainless handles (it only costs 5 to 10x as much) or buy a good oven mitt or two.Obviously several of the reviewers are illiterate as they didn't read the care instructions.  But to be fair Lodge doesn't say that you really need to boil water in the pan and then wpie with oil and heat before using.  The pre-seasoning only shortens the seasoning process. it DOES NOT REPLACE SEASONING!"
4,"ANOTHER American cultural icon from the 60's has beendeemed unacceptable by those who would prefer to seemalice where none exists.Not even Underdog can escape the slings and arrows ofthose with the same mentality as the book-burners of1930's Germany.Why do we allow such obvious Orwellian 'Newsspeak' toedit our past? Come on... this IS a cartoon. for Pete'ssake. NOT some social/political statement.Nothing here needs to be edited or 'cleaned up'. Theseare simple 'good vs. evil' stories with a happy ending.and should be offered in their entirety... music/songs.credits and all.And. if one is offended by ANY of this... then one mayexorcise one's freedom NOT to purchase such!Nuff' said..."
1,"I already raved somewhere about these.... they are JUST AMAZING and so far can't seem to find anything betterdon't like pills so these are very thin and compared to regular ones are night and day and they don't smell after like Trojans...you get used to how they look...but again. we disagree on the smell. I don't smell them but my other half does.these are the best we've tried so far! just amazing! ....they're hard to open but totally worth the price and the effort. He loves them. definately the best out there that we've tried. They're not slimy....will order again!"
10,"This product is almost exactly the same as the Ryobi BE231 it replaced. Externally the primary difference is a carbon pad to reduce frction on the Bosch. The Bosch cost twice as much. and became nonfunctioinal after little use. while the Ryobi model withstood heavy use for years. There was so much friction on the carbon pad. that it heated up painfully. The sander started breaking belts for no apparent reason. The dust collection on the Ryobi was not good. but it was totally nonfunctional on the Bosch.I have been satisfied with the Bosch routers (1613.1617). but their sanders. both belt and ROS. have not worked well for me."
1,"My dermatologist strongly recommendsAquaphor Healing Ointment. 1.75 Oz (50 G). (Pack Of 6)BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there's one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program for this item ->**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**"
1,"I love the original Mocha Chip balance bars.  They were terrific.  But. they put them in new packaging (fine. who cares. right?) but they also re-formulated them and it's really sad what they've done to them.  They're sickly sweet now. they have a cake-y consistency that's not appealing and there's barely a 'chip' in sight.It's all bad.  I bought tons of these and ate them for breakfast.  No more.  The new ones are so bad. I threw out the ones I bought after trying a few times to eat them."
9,"All natural. does not polute. no chemicals on your skin. all natural. So natural you can brush your teeth with it! It has been a favorite of us backpackers for years and only a few drops will usally do the job. I have tried the Almond. Citrus. Eucalyptus.Tea Tree. and Peppermint. My favorite is the Peppermint which leaves you tingling and smells great. and taste's allot better than the others for brushing your teeth. If used right a bottle will last a very. very. long time. You can also wash clothes. dishes. whatever. with it. There are several stories about it and its creator on the web. A peculiar history for a great product. that is still made by the same family operation.I started by just using it for backpacking and now get it to use at home too."
3,"I loved this shorter story about Zadist. Bella and Nalla. I had no idea that they were having troubles in their marriage. I couldn't believe that things almost didn't work out for them. My heart was breaking for Bella and Nalla. and Zadist too because of everything that he was going thru. It's like a normal every day marriage - there was lack of communication and I was so happy that during the read they were able to figure out what they needed to figure out. talk about what they needed to talk about. and work it out. Oh I just love the whole series and can't wait for March 2013. Once again J R Ward outdid herself with this short story about the now happy lil perfect family!"
4,"I am a mother of a 10 month old. She started watching this when she was 8 months old and just simply loves it. I can put her infront of the TV turn it on and a lot of times she will sit and watch the whole DVD! As you know for a 10 month old that is  unusually! But she loves it that much! I have a Nephew that is 2 years old and he just loves it as well! I recommend any parent out there that wants a educational fun Video/DVD for there child ages 6 months- 6 years this one is GREAT!!!!"
11,"THis game only got 4 due to the luck factor.  No matter how well you play. you could just draw bad cards everytime.  That is it.  Other than that. this is a wonderful. wonderful game.  This IS the perfect game to get people into Eurogames like Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.  Easy to explain - 5 minutes tops.  Fast to play - 1 hour.  Good strategy.  Good theme.  You even feel like you are being educated at least a little bit in the area of US geography.Bottom Line:  Best family board game in existance.  Anyone can learn to play it relatively quickly."
8,"My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel. I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate. so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog.Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher. I never had this problem--it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance. My husband. however. has trouble with it releasing to LATE (some people had problems with it releasing too early). I guess it varies from person to person!"
1,"After using all types of eyebrow grooming wax to hold down my unruly brows. I had almost given up until I found this gem of a product.  My current eyebrow wax was a little too hard and unfortunately would yank out a few hairs with it.  In a last ditch attempt. I tried the clubman moustache wax in neutral.  Keep in mind that my eyebrow hairs are VERY unruly (and yes. I am a lady)and finding something that really works and has staying power had been difficult until now.  You only need the smallest amount on each brow because the product is very concentrated.  My eyebrow hairs stay in place all day and look better than they ever have.  I also like the fact that it dries clear and that there is no build up.  It also doesn't dry out my skin like other products.  Definitely a keeper!"
3,"Esme is abused by her father after her mother leaves them.  Seeking a way out she is going to marry until she realizes the man is just as awful (and as old as) her father.  When she witnesses the scene across the street she decides that Captain Radwell is the man to ruin her and get her away from her father.  What she doesn't count on is the honorable streak that he is trying to have.  He delivers her to his brother and his wife for help.  And then he sticks around.  Great read!"
5,"Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop. the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway. I've been playing guitar for about 15 years.  I've been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack. don't feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)  Durability wise. I'll lose the pick before it even comes close to wearing out!"
10,"Bought a box of this to go with my PC 343 sander. Don't make the same mistake as I did. The PC 343 is 8 hole. This sandpaper is 5 hole!But other than my mistake in ordering it. I have used it with the PC343 and it sands and sands and sands! The paper is heavyweight and last a lot longer than what I was using with my C-backed 3M sander. Picks up dust reasonably well considering I am only using approx 2 or 3 out of the 5 holes. Probably the best sand paper I have used in a long time.Price is alright if you are buying just one box. I have found suppliers selling it for $16 for all grits. If plan on getting several boxes or the higher grits. it is available from other online suppliers for $16 a box (Plus $6 shipping). Just do some surfing. you may get better deals from time to time with store promotions."
3,"The other reviewers have covered most of what I would say about the series. As they noted. the 'ambience' is constant smoking and cocktails every evening along with a fairly hard-nosed attitude about solving problems. These stories were written only a decade or so after the use of nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Because of this. nuclear weapons and even more destructive follow-ons show up often.Piper is a relatively 'hard' sci-fi writer for his time. He is not hung up just on technology. but includes legal drama. detailed and appealing alien description. and good character depiction. He also explores an area that is very relevant to modern life: the battle between profit motive and morality in business.Although I have been reading sci-fi for many years. I had never read any of Piper's stories. I am sorry that I missed them until now."
11,"Unlike a lot of games I've gotten for my daughter. Qwirkle was one I was not familiar with from having playing it as a child. Not sure if it was around back then. or if it's just a modern version of a classic concept (like dominoes perhaps?). All I know is that I love playing it and so does my almost-six year old daughter. And the cool thing is we can each play at our own level and still play together. I don't have to &#34;dumb down&#34; my playing at all. And she never has to feel like I'm letting her win. Her moves have surprised and challenged me just as often as the other way around. Not many games like that. are there? Highly recommend."
4,"This sensational DVD. culled from a TV show I have cloudy memories of from my youth. presents Andy Kaufman in a way that surpasses the Milos Forman biopic (not to denigrate Jim Carrey's outstanding performance) and the  A&amp;E Biography. You get it all here. and it's mostly hilarious. Best of  all is Mr. Kaufman's dead-on Elvis impersonation...his choice of songs is  impeccable--&quot;Too Much&quot; is an Elvis hit that Mr. Presley seldom  performed live. Great introduction (or reintroduction?) to this fascinating  character."
11,"I appreciate the materials used to create this puzzle and our three year-old loves the picture that is formed when the puzzle is complete. Soy inks + recycled cardboard = Wonderful.I have only one criticism. and it's a minor one. Since the puzzle is intended for a younger audience. it might be nice if the pieces were a bit thicker. Our son has good fine motor skills. but the pieces can still bend and crease as he works to fit them together. With that said however. the creasing may be due more to his impatience when the pieces don't seem to fit right than with the build quality of the puzzle."
10,"This tool does everything the manufacture says it does and does it well.  No wonder many magazines have made it their &quot;Editor's Choice&quot;.I don't understand the negative reviews.  I have experienced none of the problems some people have mentioned.  Maybe a person needs to be smarter than the tool.  I make my living with a plate joiner doing plastic laminate countertops and it has been flawless.  I've used tools costing much more with no improvement in results.The only place I might take away a half star would be since the fence is so precise you wouldn't want to turn it over to an employee who would drop it on a concrete floor.  Other than that I don't know how you would improve upon it."
10,"I read in several builders forums I frequent that these stops were a joke..........until I used em'! I don't know what those people were talking about.Maybe they just never gave them a chance. I know I had the pair I bought with the saw the year the saw came out sitting in a drawer until just recently when I had a gazillion feet of crown to do. Slapped those babies on and was happy as a pig in.....I too wish they had a quick release. Thats kind of annoying when I need my saw for something else.I like the tip someone here gave about drilling new holes for bigger crown. If that situation arises for me I think I'll give it a try."
10,"Product works as advertised but  the run-down test on a new Lithium battery was a bit disappointing.  With frequent power outages. I want a light that will last a long time.  I turned around and purchased the LED bulb kit and resolved this as an issue.The provided bulb's brightness was mildly disappointing.  The LED is brighter but does not throw as wide a beam.But if you add the cost of the floodlight ($35) + LED kit ($25) . it's a bit pricey."
10,"I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept. and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws. the cost. life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim. I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive. they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades. and improves the quality of the blades. that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight."
3,"As a stand-along book. I really enjoyed The Twelve Lies of Christmas. although it didn't have as much of a holiday theme as the title would indicate.The main characters were engaging. if a bit under-developed and the story was fast-paced and kept my interest throughout the story. The one issue I had with the story is that since it's a prequel to the Sophie Green series. I'd expect to read something in the story to interest me in the series. I really didn't. Sophie was a minor footnote at the end. On the other hand. I would be very interested in reading more about Nate & Samantha. I can't imagine that their lives would become less exciting that they started in this book."
4,"The only thing I regret is not having held the purchase of this film until this Definite Edition came along which. judging by the bare-boneness of the previous one. was very much a fact.Still. this DVD is very much worth of a double-dip. there are so many hard to interpret details throughout the film that Mel Gibson's commentary should be most enlighting.I can understand that unless seen under the conviction of Christ's divinity. the violence of this film is totally pointless (and appalling). Roger Ebert was right to call it the most violent movie ever made. For Christians however. this is obliged viewing. Judge Mel Gibson all you want but at least he has done one undeniably good thing which. in no exageration. has been life changing to more than a few. How many people can say that ?"
5,"I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal. it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot. so I had that replaced. but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product. but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had."
1,"This bottle brush is great. We bought it for washing things like water bottles and glasses. It might be hard to see in the picture but the blue part of the brush sticks out a little and it more flat to help get all the corners of whatever you're cleaning. Also the grippy part is easy to hold on to and the neck of the brush is long enough for everything I've used it on. I'm always happy with OXO products and this one is no exception.I highly recommend this."
1,"While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands. I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.  I cannot say for certain you'll have the same bad experience. as it depends what you use them for. but for me they barely seem to make it 2-3 months and sometimes only weeks before they lose too much charge to be of use.  They're nearly worthless to me.  I almost never use them anymore.I'm replacing these with Duracell ones that are advertised to hold their charge for a year. so hopefully those will work as promised.  I just cannot advise going with Energizer after using these.  Try another brand."
8,"This 'wiggly giggly' ball was very disappointing.  I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective. which of course amazon was quick to replace.  The second one came and was no better than the first one.  It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person. but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog. it went mute.  He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back.  I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $12. I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball."
3,"The WSJ for Kindle is overpriced. and the customer service has gone completely haywire since the newspaper was bought out.  I have read and subscribed by Kindle. print edition. and iPhone app (WSJ Mobile).  Unfortunately. they are all horrible in contebt delivery--even though the writing is still superb--and try calling them.  10 minute waits to speak to someone in a different country who will put you on hold. and then when you try to cancel. it is abysmal.  More waiting.  I will never be part of WSJ Online. pinrt. Mobile or Kindle after my recent experiences.  Again. the company has been bought out and is now on its way out.  Beware."
8,"Ok. I don't own this. but have thought about it. After discovering arm and hammer cat box deodorizer...I can live without the littemaid. I buy cheap litter because I've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage. I keep the box. garbage bags. the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer. I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter. Try this. if you are leary of buying the litter maid.  I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing!"
1,"Bought 3 packs. prepared to live with a high percentage of bad ones considering that locally the same batteries are $3 each. but they are easy to check in the card and all were good.  Bought these in 2011 just used the last ones and came back to order more when I realized I hadn't reviewed them.  Very pleased.BTW. it is true that the description is misleading. the batteries I received are alkaline. not silver-oxide.  I will use only silver oxide in timekeeping devices. but for toys and flashlights. alkaline is a better value."
3,"Brett. the human and Lisa. the vampire. are quite the couple.  They are the owners of &#34;On The Edge&#34; bar and they're looking for another bartender.

Can Lisa talk Brett into letting Leo share their bed?  Read this steamy short and find out if Brett and Lisa gain a bartender and a third in their bed.Kallysten does it again!  Fabulous steamy short stories that leave you wanting so much more."
5,"Ever since I started playing the guitar. I've used the nylon Dunlop picks. They're better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. They're flexible and easy to pick with. but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them. as you can get them at your local music store for about that."
5,"The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item. If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere."
6,"The Swingline Classic Cut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer is exactly what it says. it's LIGHT. and it cuts very well.  The lightness of the product does make it feel a bit cheap. but I think it will hold up just fine....it's a desktop item. not something you're going to throw around or jump on!There are two sets of measuring guides. on at the top of the cutter and another about 5 inches down which is kind of nice. the entire bed of the cutter it filled with grids so it's easy to make sure that your paper is lined up straight. very useful for cutting smaller items.I am very happy with this cutter. a great replacement for my old heavy elephant of a cutter. definitely worth it!"
8,"Dog liked this one. Enough to play with it lovingly until it was just a shred of brown cloth and fur. He chewed through the body right away to get at the squeaker. but continued chewing long after the squeaker was removed. Did not contain any stuffing for me to remove. and surprisingly the tail stayed on for the whole ride. even after being used frequently as a tug toy.It lasted about 1 month in good condition (not counting the whole where the squeaker was removed from) and lasted in ok condition for another 4 months. I still have it and occasionally give it since dog seems to like killing it just as much as day one.It is very small. fits nicely in the palm of my hand. Dog is 10 lbs. and it was perfect for him. but playing chase the beaver was sometimes a nail biting affair. Dog's biting. my nails."
8,"It does what it's supposed to. but it's LOUD! The motor itself isn't bad. but it vibrates. So by itself. the motor is quiet. but once you mount it in the tank the vibration makes the whole thing loud as heck. I haven't figured out any way to stop it from being so noisy. Wrap the motor in bubble wrap. maybe.I had the original Petmate Deluxe. until the motor finally just quit after a few years. and it was great. This one. not so much. Quality has sunk. There is no more on/off switch on the power line. The disconnect is at the plug adapter instead of near the tank itself. making it difficult to unplug and lift out when it's time for deep cleaning. There's no flow adjustment. and the flow is rather slow.I'm pretty disappointed with it and am considering returning it."
4,"What an encouraging story!  With all the odds against him. Dr. Carson came out on top with his faith and the teaching and prayers of his Mom.  If you are a single parent. I highly recommend this movie as a great source of inspiration.  The positive impact of a parent is so dramatically displayed.And if you are into details. be sure to watch the 'extra' information on the making of the movie.  It will really add to your appreciation of Dr. Carson and those who worked so hard to bring his story to life."
9,"Some of the pieces could have been put together before it was put in a box for consumers....The red bar for mom to push. for example. It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves. and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it! So. success."
5,"I own a lot of guitars and have to change strings often enough. I don't really enjoy changing strings but it needs done. this tool makes it such a breeze I don't know how I ever went without it. It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings. I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever. I am really happy with this purchase and will check out more stuff from Planet Waves."
1,"I know many use this for their infants but I had dry flaky skin around my nose and upper lip area and I added vaseline one evening and the next morning the dry flakes were history.  I was told by a friend that who has really great skin that she uses the vaseline on her entire face after she splashes a little water on it and it has really made a difference.  I did the same but I did get a little blemish on my chin and I'm usually not prone to acne anymore since I turned 40.  I think I will stick to using it on the very dry areas only."
10,"I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration. like using a hole saw in plywood. I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.  Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I don't know why DeWalt does not do the same."
11,"I purchased this game after watching it played on Tabletop on the Geek and Sundry youtube channel.  It can be a little daunting when you first set it up but is easier to play than it looks. I really like that it supports up to 8 players as we have a large group of friends that game together. It can be hard to find good quality games that support more than 4-6 players and many of the ones that do can become tedious waiting for your turn.On our first time playing we got our butts kicked. but we still had a great time."
5,"I never really considered a cheaper cable. I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon. I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise. this is an excellent cable. with good build quality and a strong. thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables. and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm. guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over. try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!"
3,"I really enjoyed this account of the sinking of the titanic. My heart really went out to the people on the ship and what they had to go through and experience. I especially enjoyed the accounts of people who were there and their thoughts and fears and their emotions as they were going through the trauma and they were trying to make sense of what was going on. I can't imagine having such an awful experience. My heart broke for the women who had to leave their husbands not knowing if they would ever see them again. I do wish more was said about the people on the lower decks but I suppose that maybe not much is known about what happened to them and maybe no one really wants to remember or address that issue. This was a very interesting book to read and I did enjoy it."
5,"If you can't find a container and add your own sponge. then buy this.Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential.I think this item should cost three bucks at most. and $1.50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better.I use this one for my baritone uke. and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts.If you make your own. just make sure to not let the sponge drip. ie. wring it out. and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood."
5,"I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say. after researching condenser microphones for several months. countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say. this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;. Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So. think about it. perfect for the amateur. perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy."
8,"Shipping was fast. got it within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping.  Says that it stops all stages of fleas. and kills and protects against chewing lice and ticks as well - I'm not sure about the chewing lice and ticks. but I did find fleas on my Lab puppy when I got him.  I use this on him. and within two weeks I didn't find any on him at all. not even after I bathe him and used a flea comb on him.  Says it works up to a month. and is water-proof.I'd highly recommend."
9,"When I considered returning the compass for smaller ones. I learned that Amazon does not accept returns for this item due to hazardous material regulations.  Not a problem in my case. but thought you'd all want a heads-up before purchasing.I purchased a few of these as additions to emergency kits I built for friends/family (see my Listmania lists).  I planned to make the kits out of Nalgene bottles. but the compass is a little too wide to fit. so instead I made the kits out ofMTM Survivor Dry Box with O-Ring Sealwhich worked out better anyway."
11,"I'll keep it pretty short. If you're considering the expansion. I would hope you already own Last Night on Earth. I think LNOE is a great game that offers suspense. teamwork. competition. and usually a lot of laughs. This expansion does not change much. What it does do is add some more locations (in the form of some new L-shaped boards). some new characters. new hero and zombie cards. and a few new scenarios. On top of that. it comes with new game pieces that are used with the free scenarios available on the games' official website or that can be used to design your own scenarios.In short. this expansion does not reinvent the wheel. What it will do. however. is help expand and reinvigorate an already great game. It's a little pricey. but if you like LNOE. it's a good investment."
9,"this lock is useless on my glock and shotgun and only barely fits very awkwardly on my sig sauer.  it does fit on my ruger revolver but barely too.  it is bulky and you're better off getting a small lock box instead of this.  it may sound good until you try in on and it doesn't fit or barely fit. not to mention it may scratch up the gun.  this claims to fit many or most guns but it doesnt fit the popular ones out there like the ones i have.  what's worse is that the 3rd digit on the combo gets stuck and is difficult to move.  that would totally render this lock totally useless.  it doens't fit and if it does fit it would take you forever just to roll the digits over to your code to unlock it!  overrated lock."
8,"My  out door  Cat  Free loader  loves this  snuggle  safe heating  Pad.  It  keeps  her  warm  for  hours.I  put  it  in  her  out door  cat  Igloo.  I  think  it  works  better than  a  pug in  out  door  heating pad.  She  just  came  to  my  door  one  day and  must  have  said this  lady  is  going  to  take good  care  of  me.And  I  do."
8,"I adopted Sam from a local shelter.  He had a dull. brittle coat. constant rash and other health issues.  I had him allergy tested and found he was allergic to some 40 foods and environmental allergens.  The allergy testing places compiled a list of dog foods he could eat.  All were expensive ($60+ for a 30lb bag) and hard to find where I live in rural Alaska.  But we love our dogs up here and I found that I could get Avoderm on Amazon for a hair over $40 for a 30lb bag with free shipping.  I haven't made my postman happy. but my dog loves it and I love the price and ease.  Sam can't have potatoes. peas. and a lot of grains. so Avoderm has really changed his life and mine.  Thanks Amazon!"
9,"OK. so my main complaint on this knife is. it is seriously the smallest knife known to man. I realize there is a size listed in the description. but honestly. who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this. intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip. as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow. I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for. given that I lose the knife in my own hand. it's so small.Again. I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length. but seriously. nobody needs a knife this small.  I would return it. except I'm not sure it's worth the cost of return shipping."
9,"Double bladed. my only gripe is the blade's a tad short. Most manufacturers of great knives don't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges. but SOG. The characteristics of this knife make it a good fighting knife. but a little on the smallish side. Take a look at the Cold Steel Voyager with a 5- or 6-inch blade for not a whole lot more money. Chances are you'll drop this one in a heartbeat.Free shipping on knives would be great. too. but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales. At least on smaller items."
11,"I play tabletop games on at least a weekly basis. I really like Chrononauts because of the unique gameplay mechanisms. I love the idea of creating your own timeline. My boyfriend always tried to legalize marijuana. no matter what his identity (in the game). I like that there are a few ways to win. There is really no way to know who is ahead in this game. Anyone can win unexpectedly. The text on the cards is cute and funny. The games usually end within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. within an hour) and anyone can win. Even my mom won at Chrononauts because someone else accidentally patched up her timeline right before her turn. I have the Gore Expansion and Early American Chrononauts. I combine Chrononauts with the Gore Years but not with Early American. I tried that. but it is just too much crap on the table. It gets a little hectic."
5,"Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it. I hadn't noticed that in the listing. maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable. my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle. good as new. I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit. I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days. Works a charm on acoustic guitars. haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet."
5,"This is for theKyser Banjo/Mandolin CapoThis is one of three capos I use for a ukulele.  It works. and is my second favorite.  I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele. and it is easy to add. move. remove. With the trigger-type release. it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards. and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo. Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.  Free shipping for Prime members!!!For the price and quality. this Kyser capo works on a uke. Highly recommended."
9,"Love it love it  love it.I've been needing a camping knife for a while. I already owned several SOG products and have found them to be an acceptable balance of price and quality. This product is no exception. Are their better? Of course! But there are much worse for much more money. as well. THis is an excellent value for an excellent blade that I expect to last forever. Or.  until I give it away / lose it/ abuse it to disrepair. This buy is a no-brainer for anyone in the market for a similar sized blade.The only thing I may--- MAY - have changed. was going for the kydex rather than nylon.... but I do like that the extra storage in the nylon version is perfect for a sharpener or my SOG multitool."
9,"This set is good for the office - and if you have carpet. it would help if you attach some velcro at the ends to make the mat straight. Otherwise the mat is my biggest complaint - it does not straighten out enough. The return mechanism is pretty good. the unit itself feels fairly cheap. My 7 and 10 year olds enjoy it. even set some obstacles to make the course more interesting.As far as using it in the office. I had a few bosses who like to &#34;practice&#34; at the office. and this would be a winner for a birthday gift."
8,"Bought this for our 50-pound dog. for use following surgery. to reduce the risk of post-op hernia.  Trained him on it prior to surgery. since he's used to jumping in and out of the van.  Dog navigated it just fine. even in post-anesthesia haze :-).  Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table.  All surfaces are coated. so there's nothing to scratch the vehicle's paint.  When folded. ramp kept closed with a coil spring. protected with a bit of clear tubing.  Simple solution that works just fine.  Notch in rails well-placed to carrying when folded.  Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp.  Definitely recommend to dog friends."
4,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend in the theaters as soon as it came out.  This is not really a very religious movie. but rather describes the last 12 hours of Jesus before he was crucified.  The content of the movie is very strong though.  Throughout the whole movie. I was bothered by how many times Christ was punished...was just in about every other scene!  I think. that the director(s) abused a little of the punishment. but that's my opinion.  We didn't get to live those times to find out how it really was. but it was very hard. lots of punishment and suffering.It shows clearly all the suffering Jesus went through. and how he stayed strong the whole way.  Like another reviewer mentioned. the Satan character and deamons that haunt Judas were well done.Overall. the movie is very good. with lots of strong & violent scenes and sad moments as well. Go watch it and/or buy it and renew your faith!"
10,"A well engineered product released after they 'got the bugs' out.  Doesn't sound very American.  Jorgensen has a well known reputation and they seem to want to maintain it.  The metal is clean. all parts align and the size and weight are a good mix for most applications.I would only suggest two additional things.  The handle's end caps don't fit well (sometimes).  Do not force them on or they will split.  Lightly taper the handle and either screw. glue or do both. 'J' could send 3 to avoid user problems.  Secondlyly. I would like to 'J' supply a pair of hard wood inserts for the steel jaws.  TJS"
4,"I should have left this review a long time ago. I could kick myself for buying it. thinking it was a film. not a religous object. If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals. you risk being burned at the stake. an act of love to purify your soul.This film.as a film. disregarding the topic. is a dog. A cheap 'B' grade. blood spurting. flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles. I could go on for an hour. but won't bother."
9,"These don't last long if you sharpen a good deal.  After a couple of months a significant amount of the grit is gone and you have to start seeking good spots on the sharpener. usu. top and bottom.  Same with my Lansky fine sharpener. When the grit goes. the holes (on either) start catching the edge--not good.  Still. even quality stones wear. and as I said. I just bought my 3rd one in 3 years. so there must be something right about it.  Basically. it is quick. gets a good--not great--I use Japanese water stones for my best knives--edge. Frequently. I have had friends admire whatever knife I am carrying and pull theirs out and this enables me to put a quick. easy edge on their blades and hand it back to them. tickled."
1,"Very good product would recommend just ordering with Christmas rush all types of packages in the mail. My order came in a envelope manila that is with small boxes of gel inside. Two boxes were crushed on one side. Took the other two out and cleaned them up. Contacted Ayr and they wanted pictures of crushed boxes that were in the trash. They stated in a email that they were sorry and would replace ASAP. HAS BEEN OVER TWO WEEKS AGO. They know Amazon is reading there response so they make it look great in guess. Would NOT ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN."
9,"The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad.  Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize.  The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft.  The unit just doesn't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose."
1,"In general. Duracell and Enrrgizer perform significantly better than more generic battrries in terms of battery life. Yhese are no exception. I used them in a stompbox. and even though this is primsrily for practice and jamming. i don't want interruptions to change the batteries. These don't disappoint.The pricing of Duracell on Amazon has also been much better than I can get locally. Before I bought these. I tried three drugstores and one supermarket to see ifIi could pick up a better deal. It wasn't possible. The batteries I could find locally were runnng almost twice as much as these Duracells on Amazon. As long ss that remains the case. I will continue to buy online."
5,"At the begining I wasn't sure to buy it since there are a lot of reviews out there with negative imputs about this. so I decided to buy it and I started having problems right of the box. I notice this noise coming out of my amp and also a bad performance of my pedals. then I started to play with them and realized that I had too many pedals connected through a daisy chain. so I decided to leave just one connector alone and available and only used 4 with my pedals and surprise!. connected to a power strip it eliminated all the unwanted noise and performance started to work just fine. I also realized that pedals positions (routing signal) has something to do with it. I couldn't figure out what was it but defenetly works just fine once you got it right. so I would recomend to play a little with your set up and make sure to avoid abuse on it. so it work as it is supposed to."
11,"I'll admit. I like it. we have a 4 and 6 year old and they ate it up.  It made Christmas really fun this year.  Some drawbacks:  1) I got tired of telling them to be good because the elf would tell Santa (do not let this replace real parenting).2) If you are a Christian like I am. you will need to bring the real message of Christmas into this story or it will overshadow it.3) Don't forget to move the thing every night!  Sheesh. my kids thought the elf didn't move because they were so bad the day before. the elf couldn't bear to tell Santa."
1,"They are used in an Acurite weather station that we purchased.  The weather station has an outdoor sender that it mounted on our patio.  During the coldest parts of the year. the temperature on the patio can be in the teens.  Acurite. in the manual that comes with the weather station. recommends that lithium batteries be used in the outdoor sensor.As recommended by Acurite. we used the lithium batteries in the outdoor sensor.  We purchased these batteries about a year ago.  So far. the batteries have performed flawlessly.  We haven't yet had to replace the batteries in the sensor so I can't comment on their life. except to say that it's at least a year. at least for our type of use."
3,"I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults.  Warning it is a long. involved tale that can't be read in one evening.  Since every character is a man. it is a less than sentimental journey.  Though they are definitely some tearful scenes.  One character is a former slave. but is treated as the others' equal though somewhat condescendedly.  I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone.  And no spoilers. but you may want to read another Verne classic when done with this one..."
11,"We use this timer as a bookmark and to time the kids' reading every day (its intended purpose).  We love this bookmark/timer for this purpose.  One comment though: the bookmark is heavy so will fall out of the book if the book is not stored flat.  Since we carry our books around in our backpacks. I recommend a hair band to keep the book shut and the bookmark in place.  Hair bands are less likely to curve the book by being too tight.But another. equally useful application is timing DS play!  And sharing toys.  And how many minutes before bedtime.  My three boys use their bookmark timer for all of these purposes and more - it's a great way to help them start learning time management.  My kids are currently 7 (twins) and 9.  All boys."
6,"I absolutely love these mailing labels!  They are convenient. and make life so much easier!  These mailing labels are smaller than certain other types of labels; therefore. more labels will fit on each sheet.  And if you use a lot of mailing labels. then that does you a lot of good.They print so quickly and easily.  Whenever you need a label. just peel it off.  These label sheets save a lot of time and energy. and are so neat.Highly recommended if you use mailing labels.And these are for ink jet printers. which is the type of printer I have at home."
11,"I bought this on a whim to play with my D&D; friends when we don't have enough players for our regular game.  It is enjoyable and novel as a result of the clear card format.  The art is interesting and the flavor text on teh cards is great.  I recommend.The loss of the fifth star is largely the result of the cost and the quality of the cards.  My set is a little bit cloudy and they have gotten moderately less clear with minimal use.I also bought the expansion and made identical comments there as well."
1,"First. you don't buy specialized bandages like this very often. I think the last pack lasted well over five years.But these new ones. yikes! The adhesive - able to stick for days (thru showers). the breathe-ability of the flexible and comfortable material. the ability of this tiny bandaid to apply pressure when needed. Latex-free and hypoallergenic (I've had bad reactions to the adhesive in bandaids. not just the latex). This stuff blows away other (more recent) models of bandaids in my medicine cabinet.It reminds me more of surgical tape with a gauze pad fixed to it. Except my surgical tape isn't this quality.Where can I find this stuff in other sizes?"
6,"Generally. my main complaint about labels is the poor quality glue that's used and their inability to stick to anything other than a narrow range of paper types. Most Avery labels can stick to a wide variety of materials ranging from paper to pained surfaces to plastic and these are no exception.As advertised. they are very opaque and anything underneath will generally not show through. If you hold the label up to the light. you might be able to make out what was underneath--but otherwise you can't see through it.They feed through printers without issue (even color lasers that may snake the labels through several rollers) and peel of cleanly.Do you need Avery labels for everything? No. not really. But you are definitely getting a better product for the money."
1,"I'm lucky. these are 'cheap' and work great for me; I eat a lot of dairy!I usually eat between one and three with my first bites of dairy. occasionally I've made a mistake and taken after. never have had a problem. knock on wood -funny thing. I live on a dairy farm. and I can drink our raw milk just fine. I need lactaid to eat our aged cheeses and pasteurized milk. I have not tried raw milk ice cream. and our yogurt is fine for me. all yogurt is fine for me ...I'm delighted I can buy this through Amazon. hard to get locally ..."
4,"Did Mel want do resell this video or was it because he wanted the art to speak for itself. then over time say his part?I didn't even know this was out until someone on the radio was discussing watching it. It seems like there was always a 'making of' planned for the DVD but with the controversy surrounding the film. it seems like he put this on the shelf until time had passed by.There was little to no promotion regarding this special edition as I mentioned. so I don't think this was about reselling as it is giving the fans of this film what they want.Time has passed to be able to watch the film. listen to the commentary and now get a peek behind the curtain.Braveheart is still my favorite of his though."
6,"I love making my own greeting cards.  These work perfectly with my canon inkjet printer.I like to take tons of pictures at parties and get togethers.  It is amazing how many funny looking faces some people make while trying to smile for a photo especially a big group.  There will always be one in the middle of doing something else instead of getting the smile right.  I like to take and isolate that one and later for their birthday or something make a funny card.  Or put funny sayings in word balloons over their heads and make a funny card.People like personalized cards and not only that. this is so much cheaper than cookie cutter cards at the store.  My friends all seem to look forward to my cards so I use lots of these Avery Half Fold products."
10,"I've used this for about six months now.  For the price I am satisfied. But you get what you pay for. It required at least an hour to true the sole. clean the paint from certain areas and sharpen the blade. And the blade doesn't seem to hold an edge for a long time. I think I'll ask Santa to put a Lie Neilsen in my stocking this year. For the weekend warrior. this is probably the perfect plane. But beware. the blade needs to be sharpened before use."
1,"I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold. my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it's a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However. for some reasons. it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don't have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning. wash it off by the afternoon. and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face. it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes. shine. oily looking. However. if you don't care too much about your appearance. it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh. did I mention that the price is very reasonable?"
9,"I have an older one and I have to agree with the flaws cited by other reviewers.  The hard plastic wheels are slippery. make an annoying grinding sound. and they ride rough.  The handle is way too short.  I have to hunch over to hold it.  Other less significant problems: the foot rest is too narrow so my 1 year old just drags his feet (2 year old can peddle or push with his feet fine).  The best thing about it is the low seat height (1 year old can climb on easily. not so with Radio Flyer).  It's also not expensive like the otherwise much better-made Kettler.  Between this and the Radio Flyer. we're set until it's time for real bicycles.  Trikes do tip.  I think that's how boys get tough. no?  or at least more careful."
6,"Overall. I'm very satisfied with these.  I originally had thought I'd use them for individual labeling of mail. however. my software doesn't allow for single print of labels.  So. I initially wasted an entire sheet when the address printed on all the labels.So. I've gone to using them for my return labels.  I use a Canon M83 color printer and they come out just fine.  I will say that 'virtually disappear' is a pretty big stretch...to me the labels are still very visible even though they are clear."
9,"Perfect soap for me. It doesn't dry out my skin. its hypoallergenic. it is biodegradable so I can use it while backpacking. it has tons of freaky pseudo-cult stuff written all over it for shower time reading. what more could you want? No weird fragrances means that it is basically just castile soap mixed with peppermint oil. The peppermint oil can be a bit jarring on really cold winter mornings. but it is completely amazing after working out. When you are trying to cool down after a workout. the peppermint oil is so. so nice.Recommend for anyone who likes simple refreshing soap?"
8,"Our German Shepherd. Gabby. is so energetic when we give her these. which is every morning. She does prefer the roasted beef Zuke's better. but loves these. also. The vim and vigor that she gets from these are unbelievable and she is very peppy after consuming the recommended amount. I think highly of this product and believe that the ingredients make a huge difference in the well being of our pup! She is happier. springier. and does not act like an old lady. like she used to! Awesome stuff!!"
9,"I've been using Dr. Bronner's for many decades. It's my favorite camping soap. but is a refreshing wash-up anywhere. I use it to freshen water bottles too. It gets rid of that funny plastic taste and smell. Larger quantities are cheaper than the smaller bottles you might find at your local mountainously overpriced sports stores. I gave it four stars because I do prefer the original formula that was stronger and left a size-able tingle on your skin. but even toned down it's a great soap. I'll continue to buy it."
4,"This one totally bites.  Unless you were born in the 40's this one is completely out of date.  No bite no bang and way too much buck.  The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room.  Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers.  Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot.  If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride.  That's a biker flick.  This is yet another example of how phony the 60's were.  Save your money.  I wish I had."
6,"This is the one.  This is the first all-in-one keyboard cleaning kit I have ever used that really delivers.  The instructions are clear and the tools are high quality.  After using the cleaner for the first time I was amazed that my keyboard (a Logitech ergonomic) looked and felt brand new after I had used dirty fingers to pound out thousands of pages on it.  Don't even bother with searching for another kit.  There is one thing though.  There should be about twice as much of the cleaning solution provided."
3,"I enjoyed this book so much!  Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones!  What an Alpha Male Hero!  I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores!  The suspense never let's up!  The action is well planned!  It is a taut. fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved!  I loved the fact that that the author. Mr Camacho. made Hannibal a very human hero. who wins a few and loses a few!  For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading!  I am definitely a FAN!"
11,"Since it was high on the list of popular games at the major gaming convention in Germany. and it was a worker placement game (my favorite mechanic). I was very excited to finally get this new game. Not disappointed at all!! The theme is so fun (elves. dwarves and gnomes). it is easy to learn. and the depth is very good. You can make it easy to play or more difficult. depending on a few simple modifications on the board. I would say it's medium to light-heavy for strategy. I got this game about two weeks ago and have already played it six times. So happy I got it. If you like games like Le Havre. Agricola. or Calyus. you will probably like this game as well. Enjoy!"
6,"I love the Avery line of products and have been using for years. I juts ran out of a competitors labels and ordered these Avery labels. I can now see that the quality of the imprinting is much better on the Avery than with the proviso product and I noted I only saved a few cents difference between the two. I have gone back to the Avery labels. They are crisp. pull from their backing easily and stick to the envelopes.The only thing that is not user friendly is some of the templates that Avery has on line. They are time consuming and frankly I would rather find an alternative software as they are too hard to manipulate."
6,"This notebook paper isn't the best that I've used. It's still pretty nice though. It's a little on the thin side but It fits nicely in a binder. The only advantage I can think of for this thin paper is that your notebook won't be so heavy! I also wondered if the thickness of the paper meant that ink would go right though. I checked that with my runniest pen. which is a Pentel gel pen and am glad to say that the ink does not bleed through. The wide ruled paper is perfect for some children that write bigger. Other than that. the paper has no other flaws and works nicely as notebook paper."
10,"I bought this handy contraption because the Bosch brand has never let me down. It's just the tool for cutting wood trim and  does a great job on PVC pipe. too. Plus. this saw has all the features I value. I like using it freehand to square off or flush cut studs and rafter projections when prepping for drywall in my half remodeled 1930's vintage home. It can reach into places where getting a handsaw is impossible. It has a variable speed dial that lets you match the tool to the material. It's a shame it doesn't come with a blade for metal cutting. I don't use this tool as much as some of my other Bosch products. like my Progressor jigsaw. but it sure is great to have on hand. Never know just when you'll need it. Thanks. Amazon!"
11,"I bought this set for a 13 year old girl who is a friend of the family because she loves fashion. She spent the afternoon putting together a fashion line. The ribbons. sequins. beads. and 'fabrics' (paper) come in such a large variety of lovely choices I couldn't resist joining in. This would be an excellent gift for an older child in the hospital. travelling. or simply to pass a rainy weekend. There is so much paper included and choices with the stencils that this book provides a great deal of playtime."
10,"These blades cut great.  Nice clean cut on veneered products such as the side of a cabinet. etc.  Only downside. and maybe it's just with my Festool jigsaw. when ran at high speeds (cutting) these blades make the worst high pitched noise you've ever heard.  I can't even explain the sound but if you don't plug your ears it will literally make you brain dead.  You can feel your ear drums resonating in your head!  And again. maybe it's just my saw or my ears but it's painful.  If I am only making a 5&#34; cut with this blade I will literally walk off the job site to my truck and get my ear plugs.  It's that bad.  Other than that the blades cut great!"
3,"I love On the Edge! Meeting Brett. Leo and Lisa through the out of the box series made me want to know soo much more about these characters. If you haven't read the out of the box set. On the edge is a great introduction to what you will get a whole lot more of in the rest of the series. HOT scenes between the trio. and the different combinations of duos too. I just reread the story again. and the second time around it is still as good as the first... now seriously thinking about reading the rest of them again too :P I love the personalities. and they all play off of each other in great ways. Thanks Kallysten for continuing to keep me aroused. entertained. and eagerly awaiting what ever series instalment you have coming out next. :)"
5,"Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me. so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine. Seemed no matter how I tried. I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitar.It seems that &#34;C&#34; shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings. and I find that is better done by hand. So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature.  And the string winder itself also works well."
8,"Well. my dog cannot chew this to smithereens. So that's good. But it's HUGE and heavy. I have a 75lb pit-bloodhound mix that can't make a dent in it because it's like concrete. I think chew toys have to have just a little &#34;give&#34; to them to make the chewing satisfactory. This dog can shred KONG extremes and can't get his teeth into this. It's so heavy that he dropped it from his mouth once and it actually made a dent in our wood floor. Seriously. So he's kind of lost interest in it since he can't really do anything with it. I wish I had ordered a size smaller than the weight chart indicates."
5,"I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!"
4,"The Visual Bible Gospel of Matthew is excellent.  I love the acting and the way the Bible comes to life through the word for word script.  I found it very inspiring and helpful.  My four daughters and I have watched 'Matthew' numerous times and it always is benefitial.  I especially like the happiness that Jesus portrays.  We know he drew people to him. and the actor in this video has appropriate expressions and whatnot which make him very appealing.  Throughout the Gospel he is not always happy. of course. but is appropriate to the situations. happy. sad. angry. distressed. etc...  Jesus was very human. and this is apparent in this Visual Bible Matthew.  Jesus was also divine. and God's love shows through as well.  I really highly recommend this Visual Bible. Gospel of Matthew.Thanks!"
11,"Ihad my doubts at first.  Let's face it. when someone says &#34;Let's play monopoly.&#34; the first thing you think of is Oh no! a long boring game.  Well. that was my first impression when my husband suggested buying the game.  Totally changed my mind from the very first time we played the game.  We have family night and couples night with this game.  It is fun and worth the investment.  I know it's a little on the higher end of cost but it is lots of fun."
6,"First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear. this is the right product for you.  On that. 5 stars.  On the amount of tape the comes on the rolls each-- a 3 star.  It's a better deal and more than the standard 'green' Scotch tape 3 pack. and the price is lower. but still. you'll be shocked at how little tape is on these rolls. If you need multiple dispensers and don't use it much. this is a decent purchase.  If you don't need tape at multiple locations. I wouldn't choose this over a single roll with much more on a single roll. less packaging. etc."
5,"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used. and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet. which many are not. and it puts out 9.6 volts. which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals. but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still. that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers. not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay. and a little extra gain driving the tubes. and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of. including the Boss ones. Dan has released some cool. well-made pedals in the past 15 years. and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.A very good deal at 15 clams."
5,"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal. you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount. if necessary) and more tone control. but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range."
1,"I'm buying this set of 6 shaving creams for my husband for the 2nd time....if he didn't like the cream he would have said not to purchase again. At $2.99 per can it is slightly higher than if I were to wait for it to go on sale at CVS or Rite Aid but because of the convenience of home delivery the extra .10 per can is more than worth it for me. I think it smells good and my husband is happy with how it shaves....so there you have it. not exactly a rave review but definitely a 'thumbs up'.Cheers"
4,"When I was just a little boy. my heart was filled with glee whenever my friend Underdog appeared on my TV.  From lovable. humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound. no better television show for childhood could be found.  Now that I am older. I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV.  This Collector's Set Edition. so carefully restored. can once again be purchased. to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew. ages four and six. just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks.  I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime.  So let's lift a toast to Underdog. a hero for all time. and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme."
11,"We've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play. it just isn't a very exciting game. The idea that the goal continually changes is neat. but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize. It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you can't play so another player won't win. until you have to play something to end the game. Thankfully it wasn't very expensive. This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature."
4,"In our politically correct USA this movie doesnt fit anything. Yes. most facts are not readily available. This movie shows only facts but not what led to all these human disasters. Some other facts are missing like comrade Stalin mass killing his own military leaders. By accident I own a DVD from Russia with promising title 'Dictators' which does include comrade Hitler and comrade Stalin the point being is Russian DVD include only safe facts which make all DVD laughable but this is how we are trying to rewrite history. Use safe facts and worry about nothing."
11,"I have never played 1st edition of Descent but always wanted to. Sadly. the time to play a game of descent was said to spread from 3-6 hours. Now. second edition comes out and it can easily be played within 1-3 hours. On top of that there are 16 quests to go on! I love how Fantasy Flight Games come out with great games and never skimp out on the quality. This is a great game for players who were always curious about Descent. it plays well and the instructions are easily learned. I would highly recommend the Conversion kit as well. This adds more monsters and heroes into your game. but does not include the miniatures. Love this game!"
10,"if you are like me and not ready to spend [money]on a dado set. look no further.  this baby performs.  i chose the 6' for my 10' delta contractors saw. i believe this is wise to compensate for the lower horsepower of my saw.  a smaller blade will have more rpm's than an 8' or 10'. its physics.  anyway. i like the case to keep it all organized and it comes with a handy guide that tells you what chippers and shims to use for certain cuts.  quite handy for undersized plywood.  big carbide tips that look like they will stand up to several sharpenings.so why did i only give it 4 stars?  someone at freud  just got off break on friday just before quitting time and shorted me an 1/8' chipper. Quality control cost ya a star Freud."
9,"After discovering the possible dangers of traditional soap and shampoo. I was recommended Dr. Bronners by a co-worker. I received it without realizing you can basically use it for anything. not just shampoo and soap. I've used Dr. Bronners for shower soap and shampoo. for washing my hands. for shaving. and for even cleaning a sink. Rumor has it you can even use it for mouth wash and/or brushing your teeth. I am not 100% sure if that's true. but it is a rumor. Try at your own risk.The smell of Dr. Bonners is great and even though it's expensive for a small amount. it &#34;lathers&#34; really well. You only need a dab of this stuff to clean a wide area of whatever you are cleaning. It doesn't leave your hair/skin dry like traditional soap and shampoo can sometimes do. It makes you smell great for a while after using it. Highly recommended to traditional soap and/or shampoo."
5,"The shell and the lining of the case are perfect: hard on the outside. and soft on the inside.I opened up the box and my Epiphone Dot slid right in.The only thing that worries me is that the hinges feel a little cheap. and the lock cold be beat with a bic pen.I'm not traveling around with my guitar too much. so that's not a problem for me. but I would worry a bit if I were checking it on an airline.Otherwise. it works perfectly for what I bought it for - protecting it in my mancave / basement from dings and scratches."
1,"Compared to a regular tooth brush my teeth feel so much cleaner. and the vibration is enjoyable as well.The battery life is great. however it seems to take a while to fully charge. This is not a problem at all though because you don't need it to be fully charged to use it.The charger base is easy to clean even if dried up tooth paste begins to build up on it.As far as replacement heads. I went with theGeneric Oral-B Dual Clean Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 ct.). They work great and are cheaper than the Oral B brand replacements.Highly recommend this powered tooth brush."
10,"First of all I have to say that the reason why I happen to be  writing this review is because I was on Amazon ordering another box of these sanding discs!  There is no higher praise in my book than a return customer!Now for the review:  I have to agree with the other positive reviews and say that I have long been a fan of these Mirka sanding disks.  I am a home woodworker whose projects range from DIY stuff around the house. to refinishing. to building fine furniture projects.  I have been using these discs for years (in every grit from 80 to 220) and could not be more pleased with the smooth surfaces they produce with my rather inexpensive sander.I completely agree with the assessment that although these are not the absolute best hook and loop discs on the market. they have performed every task I have asked of them.  Overall. I would give this product an A- for quality/performance. and an A+ for value."
10,"Well folks this saw is the best I have ever owned . I chose this one over the nonsliding variant soley for versatility . I can bounce from framing to trim with no extra work beyond flipping the crown stops .The stock 60 tooth blade is adequate for most work but for delicate ornate trim I use a series 40 ( 96 tooth blade ). I have had my saw for about 3 months and I love not doing the old ' upside down and backwards ' technique .If anyone wants to see some pics . ask and I'll email you asap.I have used it on wood .poly. and foam crown with great results.  Tom"
4,"I enjoyed the message David tries to portray and have respect for what he is trying to tell us. I am disappointed in his presentation.  Our family home schools our children and we were hoping to be able to use the series to educate our children about the christian message.  The American Heritage Series is basically just a long lecture. Its an unpolished narrated lecture that makes history boring like they do in many classrooms.  David is like the expert professor who puts his class to sleep because of presentation. I rate him 3 stars. Actually an average of 5 stars for content and 1 star for presentation."
4,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie! We have three different movie portrayals of Jesus Christ. which are completely consistent with their respective Gospels. and we enjoy all of them. (Read my other reviews if you're interested in them.)The happy. laughing Jesus in this movie is intriguing. The way he speaks to people and looks at them warmly portrays his love for everyone. I think the actor really does a great job of portraying the duality of Jesus. how much he loves us. but yet that all is not hearts and flowers and warm and fuzzy due to the human condition.If you're looking for a great movie to share with friends. family. small group. etc.. this is it! Don't watch late at night because you'll want to stay awake!"
3,"I purchased this E-book after reading some of the reviews and was somewhat disappointed. I thought the story line seemed interesting at first. but after reading only a couple of chapters discovered that this was a book souly written around the sex. I thought the ending of the book was very unlikely. The book was ok. it could have used more focus on the story and less on the sex. You barely know anything about the characters before they are rolling in he sheets together! So. I guess if your looking for a quick read that involves mainly sex and no substance than this is the book for you."
5,"If you need it. good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap.  Leather or simulated. this was quite adequate for my purposes.  Price was right! Delivery was immediate.  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case.  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument. since it comes in at least two distinct color tones.Planet Waves Mandolin Strap. Brown.  Also comes in Black. There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price."
1,"I used to stay in hotels 4 nights of the week when working out of town. Nothing worse for good sleep than noise. a strange place. and jetlag. If you get a smoking room or a stale-smelling room. it can be really be pretty bad. I used to put the television on a non-channel for the white noise (blocks traffic. elevators and voices a bit) and burn scented candles for the odors.The Homedics device is a lot better than burning a candle and having the TV on all night. I love the woodlands sounds and aromatherapy sure works for me (and certainly gets rid of that &quot;hotel&quot; smell as well.)If you travel or know someone who has to be on the road. this is a great thing to take with. And if you have a fussy baby. sometimes it can help (although I lent one recently to a friend with a colicky kid but he still preferred to be in a car. driven round and round and round and....)"
11,"This is the basic Fluxx card game that will change your ideas about 'rules.' There really aren't any set rules in Fluxx. That's why it's called Fluxx (though I have quickly learned this can also be used as a cuss word.) The rules are constantly changing. as are the ways in which you can win. so you can kiss any sense of strategy goodbye! You simply have to go with the flow and luck of the draw. The only thing that can ruin the fun of this fast changing game is the eventual winner. The more they gloat. the less you'll want to play."
6,"I used these labels to print some return address labels. All in all they came out great. but had to waste a few sheets before I got them just right!I'm not sure if it was my printer or the labels. but the template that Avery told me to use was a tad off - some of the text got printed off the label. All I did was mess with the margins in MS Word a little bit. saved the template. and it ended up coming out quite nice.I do like the concept of the 'Easy Peel' and it works pretty decently. I'd say someone with arthritis could benefit from this very much.I'm so happy that I don't have to write my address on all my outgoing mail anymore!"
9,"Today I bought the second of this scooter. The first I had bought last summer and was great. It's seen a lot of use. and a fully grown adult has put it through its paces without issue.Tonight I bought another one. and it's going back to the store immediately. The problem with it is that the handlebar tube is jammed and very stiff. There's no way a child could adjust this. since I estimate I had to apply well over 100 lbs of force with my foot against the foot area while pulling very strongly against the handle bars to get even 10&#34; of extension. I'm unable to pull it out further. The handlebar is just hopelessly jammed into the tube. so back to the store it goes.Too bad. as the rest of it continues to seem fairly bulky and lots of shiny metal everywhere."
1,"I have used this kit three summers in a row to wash my delicates while traveling abroad. The sink stopper is a wonderful invention and tends to work on most tumba and deep sinks. On very small sinks. it will still work but you may notice it does not hold as tight of a seal. The soap packets are a good size. though I typically only use about half of the packet for six or so undergarments. As long as I fold down the top of the packet. the rest of the Woolite stays inside. The Woolite is easy to wash out and leaves my clothes clean and soft. I would highly recommend this kit to anyone going on a trip who may need to do an emergency load of laundry!"
4,"Well. this does not have the captivating qualities of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.&quot; And unlike other Christmas specials I have rated. I can not really find any deep messages. (A lot of Christmas specials may appear for children. but they actually carry deep and profound messages.)  Nevertheless. it is a cute classic; and there are some very comical and touching moments. The most memorable moment is when Santa shows Karen that Frosty can not just melt. and I do admit I laughed when Santa told the magician he had to go home and write &quot;I'm very sorry for what I did to Frosty&quot; one hundred zillion times. I don't think this is the best Christmas special out there. but then I don't feel this should be ignored either."
3,"This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series. I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first. I loved the story but I hated the ending.  The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount. I couldn't believe it. It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me. I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one. I think that it was a good book. but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters. That being said. I'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. but I would suggest you read this series in order!"
4,"Blows the door open on Socialism for all to see.  We always suspected that something was not quite right behind the facade of the Soviet 'peoples paradise' and this film confirms it.  Some images are not for the faint of heart but are heart rending  in the brutality displayed. This film should be curricula in High Schools across North America.  Maybe then we could put this fascination and obsession about the glory of Communism to rest once and for all.  The survivor interviews were particularly touching.  Only a heartless b**tard or a devout Socialist / Communist could fail to be moved by the emotion on display.  A must see to fully appreciate the democracy we all enjoy."
4,"I first started reading the Mandie books when I was twelve.  Needless to say. I'm more than twice that age now.  So it was quite a delight for me when I stumbled across this movie at Blockbuster.  I had no idea they were making Mandie movies. I'm so glad to see it!  I thought this movie did a fairly accurate portrayal of Mandie and her kin.  I really enjoyed the Cherokee personalities.  And I thought Dean Jones as Jason Bond was especially good.  Uncle John was well portrayed by a dapper young gentleman.  And in essence. the movie was darling and very likeable.  The single and only reason I don't rate it a five star movie is because I thought the almost comedic style of acting in the movie detracted from what could have been a very serious and successful story line.  Other than that. I really enjoyed this movie."
8,"I had this for less than three days. The first day it was great.  I wish it gurgled more for the cat but it was fine.  The last day I noticed that it seemed to be going through water quickly for one cat.  Then I noticed the throw rug was saturated.  Then i noticed the discoloration of the hardwood floors.  Then i noticed the wet spot in the basement.  I checked to see if the water container was screwed on correctly.  Then i placed it on a dry towel on the kitchen counter.  Within an hour the towel was saturated.  Luckily I bought it at Walmart.  Back it went but instead of putting it aside so that some other poor peeson would not be sold this piece of crap.  They put it aside to be reshelved.  I wish I could give this 0 stars.If this fails on you it could do major damage before you discover it."
1,"We have been buying these Maglite Mini flashlights for quite a while. I have yet to try their LED version. but for now these work perfectly for me. I know that the LED one is supposedly much better. but at this price point. I have a very hard time passing these up.We probably must have about 3 or 4 of these around our home. and I personally keep 1 in every toolbag or toolbox. With the cheap price of these you can have one in every room and anywhere else you can think of. You also have a wide variety of colors to choose from. but I stick to the modest. classic black annodized.I know that this is just a review for a simple flashlight. but I believe Maglite to be the best. and I hope this review helps."
4,"This four hour video looks a the familiar &quot;Joseph&quot; story from the Bible but with a few wonderful twists.  First. it just jumps into the Egyptian setting.  Second most of the actors do a great job on their roles -- I want to say &quot;brava&quot; to Leslie Ann Warren for making Potiphar's wife engaging and even more scary than the original tale suggests.  Finally. the customs and backgrounds are the best yet that I've seen in a film version of the tale.  However. my &quot;four star&quot; rating refers to the &quot;flashback&quot; section of the film.  Yes. why it happens makes sense internally but did they need to spend so much time on it?  It very sad that Paul Mercurio's careers seems to have turned off onto the &quot;B&quot; grade track -- I think he is excellent in this movie and also in Exit to Eden."
8,"My bullies love Nylabones. they are the one thing that they do not destroy! I got them these & the big smooth bone 2 pack for Christmas. Those were a big hit. these they don't seem to like. I do not know if it's the flavor or texture . . . They have the big smooth heavy bone looking Nylabones which they like okay. they have the BIG nubby ones which they love. so I thought they would like these but they looked at them. chewed on them a little & left them for the big smooth flavored ones in the 2 pack. Those they chew on daily along with the big nubby ones. Maybe it's the flavor. They have Nylabones that are 3 years old!"
5,"I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS:  It fits perfectly; it's 'fur' lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five). but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over. two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side. and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.CONS:  It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some 'Made in China' characteristics.I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest.  On a personal level. I'd prefer it didn't say 'Epiphone' on the outside.  But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335."
4,"What makes this little film so special is so varied and precious. that it's hard to identify one area.  Of course Rudolph is the main character. as is his little girlfriend.  Then there's Burl Ives. who narrates it. and the wonderful music of Johnny Marks.  I perform his music every year. it's so upbeat and inspirational.  That he was asked to write the music for this movie was no surprise.The animation is a little dated. but the kids won't mind.  You won't find this kind of movie made anymore.  It has so many nice qualities. not to mention Santa and his elves. and the Isle of Misfit Toys. and the 'Bumble.' and Cornelius of the Yukon.I laugh as I think of all this. and it's a sweet smile. and a great film for Christmas!!!"
9,"Being new to shooting using a scope I have found this one to be simple. rugged and easy to adjust . I have it on a Ruger American in 308 and once I used a little loc-tight  I have no worry about it moving .  My only complaint if you could even call it that was there were no scope rings included with the scope .  But with this set up shooting off a bench I have a .75 to 1 MOA rifle with the right ammo so for the price I can not complain ."
1,"This brush is considerably larger than a toothbrush and grips well in the hand. They call it a 'a grout brush'; not for brushing freshly poured grout (cement). but for brushing in grout joints between tiles.I tried the brush in the shower using CLR liquid cleaner and the brush does a fine job of getting the CLR cleaner deep into the joints and the calcium. lime and mold deposits out. Also brushed the shower head several times and let the solution stand. Very satisfied about the results. Because of its narrow brushing head. the brush does well in the commode under the outer lip where fresh water enters and also down deep in the narrows of the commode.I also use this brush to brush the hardware fittings on my boat that have rusted. It works well.The brush is unlike any brush I have ever seen in the brick and mortar stores.When this one wears out. I will reorder another."
4,"I'm another one of those people who used to see daikaiju movies on Saturday matinee TV as a child. Close as I came to a couch potato and it made me really interested in Japan. I've been waiting so long to find these films given a proper digital conversion. The last few years have made me very excited (for an adult) as Toho has finally pulled the cork out of its uptight behind 15+ years into the digital revolution and allowed the west to see the Japanese-language widescreen versions of most of the Godzilla oeuvre without spending $$$ on an import.As usual. on Ghidorah. Classic Media has added some interesting short extras. I feel lucky. at this point. to even get to see the theatrical release. so my bias is very pro. but the price really is a no-brainer. isn't it?"
6,"I've used print at home business cards before. and they always left a rough edge.  There was no way around it- you could tell you printed them at home.  I have to say however. that these 'Clean Edge' business cards are a vast improvement on the past!  To a trained eye. you can still see the edge was that of a tear-away. but they look pretty darn good!  I wouldn't be embarrassed to pass these out. as I was with the older versions."
8,"I had my dog on this for a couple months and noticed a wonderful bloom in his coat but also noticed his ears began to be unusually smelly. I feed my dog raw so he doesn't get grains anywhere. I checked the product closely and noticed the ingredients label listed flax seed. Took him off Nupro and his ears cleared up. We now stay away from anything with flax. After adding raw green tripe to his diet. I am noticing similar positives. It is a shame. Nupro is otherwise a great product. I would recommend it to others whose dogs are more tolerant of flax."
4,"First off. not ALL of this movie made sense to me. I don't know really what to say here because everyone else has already said everything. Some of the beginning made a little sense because I have seen 'Life Of Brian' which is the exact opposite of this film. So I might have learned some things already. I do have many questions about it. though. I get why so many people were offended. Because Jesus sinned in some way. Throughout the movie. he kept praying that he. along with a few other folks would be forgiven. but THAT'S where I get confused. Oh well. I'm surprised I did understand SOME things. and yet. it's very interesting."
10,"The Delta 12&quot; drill press is OK for a bench top model.  I was disappointed in the chuck as it tends to stick and requires using the key at all times rather than just for final tightening.  Also I believe I would rather have had the 5/8&quot; chuck that comes on the 16&quot; floor model more than the 1/2&quot; chuck supplied with the 12&quot;.  For the extra hundred and fifty (approx) bucks I should have bought the larger floor model and got better capacity. longer quill stroke. larger and more stable table for mounting fences and jigs. etc.In the 12&quot; presses defense. it was and is the nicest of the benchtop models I have seen."
3,"When I read the book description. I thought this would be an interesting read. as a story about a married couple discovering their 'forbidden' desires and kinks is right up my alley. but when I opened the ebook and realized it was a short story. I had to lower my expectations. Still. I thought it could be good. because skilled authors can make almost anything work.Sadly. that wasn't the case here. The story's premise was never developed into anything resembling a plot. The book description was the whole story. or better. the setup for the sex scene where Roake's and Jenesta's hidden sexual needs were revealed. I've read and enjoyed stories like that (aka smut) before and I'm sure I'll read and enjoy others in the future. so why didn't I like this one? It all comes down to Roake and Jenesta. I'm afraid. I didn't 'connect' with them so I found myself indifferent to their sex scene and HEA."
9,"I bought this trailer for a trip up north. My husband filled the tires at home to the correct psi. Drove it around the driveway and everything worked great. We get to our destination and go to hook it up and the tubes are BLOWN. Actually shredded looking in spots. We were way up north and spent over an hour in the car to find a town big enough that had a store that sold bike supplies. Once both tubes were replaced the trailer worked great. Very easy to put together. I couldn't figure out how to attach it to the bike but that isn't my area. My husband had it attached in less then 2 minutes. The rubber on the original tube was very thin. I'm surprised more haven't blown."
4,"This is a fairly short Christmas special but it was made in the old days when a half hour on TV contained only four minutes of commercials. The best part about The Little Drummer Boy is its wholesome simplicity. The fact that it is so unabashedly religious is its strongest point in my opinion. Chasing the hate out of your heart and replacing it with love is a valuable lesson for all children. so I agree with another reviewer about its being a timeless family classic. It begins rather slowly but the last five minutes are absolutely outstanding and worth scanning back to watch a second time. The quotations from scripture give it its oomph but this also means that it would never be televised today on any of the big three networks. This might be a good DVD to buy because you probably won't catch it for free."
5,"These patches will greatly extend the life of you bass drum heads. Even if you use felt beaters on your kick pedal these pads greatly increase the strength and toughness of your bass drum head in the exact place it is needed most. As far as I can tel these do not change the sound of your head much if at all. They stay exactly where you put them so be sure to get it right the first time.If you have a double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either this patch or one from another name brand company."
6,"Not only did I use these for notebook dividers. I used them to label file folders.  They fit and look great with some minor adjustments (putting one folder inside another).  One of the nicest aspects of using these for dividers is the straight placement.  I think they look much nicer than anything I've used before.  I have several notebooks that have over 25 dividers. so the time I saved creating and applying the labels is very much appreciated. I also took advantage of the fact that I could play around with section titles to see which would fit best.Avery labels are about all I can get either at my local Staples and Wal-Mart stores.  (I don't even know who else makes them anymore.) I'll be buying these again."
11,"Formula D is a great party game that gets the entire room cheering. Even for the starter players. there is a set of basic rules that most can grasp very quickly. Every time I have played this game. I've had a great time. I do not enjoy cars or racing but the excitement of this game really gets your adrenaline going.The game lends easy to advanced players who want to implement the advanced rule set that want to make the game far more complicated and even more exciting.With the amount of people that can play. this game is a great pick for people that want to start introducing people into unconventional board games. I highly recommend this for anyone that is looking for a game to include a large group of people."
5,"Nothing special. Just like every other strap of its kind. I compared it to other poly straps I have and it's OK. No better and no worse. Price was good. It took a long time to come. Leather ends seem OK. I mention that because it appears to be the main complaint..I'm using it as a spare so it should be OK. I'm a little disappointed. I'm used to a higher quality from EB products. It is very adjustable and should be able to be used by nearly everyone. I don't perform a lot of antics on stage. it's just me and the axe. I don't expect any problems. Hope this helps. Small &#34;thumbs up&#34; to Amazon."
11,"This game is amazing! It takes me back to playing X-Wing and Tie Fighter on DOS as a kid. It's nice to actually play a tactical game with amazing looking pieces and gripping gameplay that doesn't involve a tv or monitor.I've never played table/live rpg games before. This thing has me hooked. The interaction with a friend is great. I also like the fact that there is no set board. You and the other designate the playing field. This is a very cool feature. I can't wait to start playing on starfield mats."
3,"I liked this story. a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit. and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to. but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together. I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him. the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story"
1,"This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++. would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet. so I am not sure on the quality. I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know . because I did the hard ground-level research. opening the controller. finding the battery. removing the battery. examining the battery. finding the name of the battery. replacing the battery. closing the battery containment area. and so on."
8,"My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew. and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems. with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well. that. and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep. since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!After months of use. I take the worn down toys away and replace them. and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.If you have a dog that loves chewing. I've say to give them a try. at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine. these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot."
5,"I've done a good bit of recording over the years. This microphone has very very low self noise. low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding. the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail. but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition."
11,"It threw me when my six year old asked for a body for Christmas. When he explained he wanted to know how the body works. I found this and I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. We do this often and we read the book that comes with it. The only way this could get better is if it came with a case to hold everything. He likes that the body parts are squishy and I like that he's learning while playing. The Organ-izer is one of his favorites. He likes knowing what everything is called. and I like the book that helps with proper placement of the organs. I would buy this one again!"
9,"This is a good quality indoor-outdoor basketball.  The texture is soft and very easy to grip when new. with deep seams allowing excellent ball control.  Regulation size (29.5).  Being soft. it's not Spalding's most durable outdoor ball--the Street model may be more durable if you play outdoors all the time. and the tack on this one does wear off after a couple of dozen hours on cement.  Indoors. it'll last forever and stay nice and grippy. It needed a little air when I received it. but otherwise. I'm totally satisfied with it.  (Although not a big deal. I also happen to like the rich leather-like color more than the brighter orange of some balls.)"
6,"These are amazing! How clever that someone devised a way to bend thin strips of shiny metal in such a fashion that they can be used to clip several sheets of paper products together so they don't get lost. They don't work as well as my stapler. but those with commitment issues will find the paper clip a great alternative. They can also be bent into fun shapes when you are faced with idle time sitting at your desk. However. it seems that once they are altered from their original shape. they do not perform their intended task very well anymore. Sure glad that I purchased 1.000 of these little buggers."
5,"Nice daisy chain. If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter. just make sure to avoid using all the connectors. since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues. if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem. I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions. so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah. and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
5,"...for something. but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook. or notepad computer. so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far. and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However. animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely. and in reality. it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner."
10,"I bought one to try it; I will be buying more. All I had to do was adjust the screws for a tight fit.  Some have criticized the noise level; remember that blades designed for exceptionally smooth cuts will contribute to the noise level because of their inherent design characteristics.  If this is a problem for you. cut the initial slot using a blade with a strong alternating angle on the teeth and a wide kerf.When installing. you might have to increase the relief on the bottom; my blade was all the way down and made contact after only 1/4 turn but I didn't have to increase the relief.Personally. I'm going to buy at least 2 more; one for 45 degree angles and one for my dado blade.  Exceptional quality and price."
1,"got 'em quick with no problems. yes they absolutely last longer [I use them in a lable maker]. These are great batteries but are not for every app. I do not recommend using the 9v version in a smoke detector. The lithium bateries by nature go until they are completely exausted then suddenly they are completely spent wih no warning. The alkilne batteries slowly get weaker thus letting the detector let out those annoying squeeks which tell you the detector's batteries need changing. Not to keen of a flashlite blinking out with no warning. But. the tremendious shelf life and longer runs between changes is a real plus.PS Check to see that you are getting the correct ones for your needs. They have different life spands of lasting 4.5.8 and the ultimate of 9 times longer than alkiline batts."
4,"Richard Boone is both narrator and participant in some of these episodes.  The historical background given by Boone in the opening scenes is brief and to the point so that you can be taken to the scene of the action quickly and efficiently.This series is a fine snapshot of medical practices of the 1950s which might seem outmoded now.  Electro-convulsive therapy is shown as a treatment practice in the '50s.  The effects of a nuclear bomb explosion are graphic and chilling to watch and listen to.  The open heart valve replacement is quite intriguing even in black and white.  Overall this is a series that while it might seem to be somewhat dated is good for historical background and comparison with the way medicine is practiced now.Growing up in the 1950s this was the state of medicine as I knew it and it seemed pretty impressive.  I recommend this to anyone with an interest in medical history."
4,"Did I miss something that the other reviewers saw? Or did I get a defective DVD set? This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The &quot;Cliffhanger episodes&quot; are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father. Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls."
9,"Coleman stoves have always been easy to dent. scratch. get burned on and are not for the weak of spirit.  On the other hand. properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost.  The white gas can be stored for years before using.  Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots.  I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones.  It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out!  I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous. tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect.  By their nature camp stoves get stored a lot and used some.  These are the good ones."
9,"Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son.  It's a wide. comfortable. mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose.  I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles. but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself.  The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy.  Oh. and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet. which is a small miracle."
9,"After my neighbor went and got one. my 4 yo begged for one.  I figured it would be good exercise. so I got her one.  It didn't take her long to figure it out.  My son. who is nervous about balancing on two wheels. saw my daughter having so much fun. he tried it out and they both fought over it.  So. I had to go out and buy one the same day.  Okay. I didn't have to. but it's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity.The construction is solid.  I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds.  The wheels glide smoothly.  I am impressed with the quality."
11,"ABBY CADABBYThe Easter Bunny brought Abby to our two year old granddaughter this year.  Abby is one of Paige's favorites on Sesame Street.  When Paige saw little Abby sitting in her Easter basket she screamed ABBY! and hasn't let go of her since.Abby is made very well. very sturdy and durable. She is a GUND. so you know she is of high quality.  Her outfit is bright and shiny. her little mouth has a heart in the center of it.  She is cuter than you can imagine and a doll that any little girl would love to own.  She comes complete with her wand; how could she function without it?Abby has a good and happy home now.  Get one for your special little girl.  We did!Thank you!Pam"

When he asks her to come home with him. she jumps at the chance.  It isn't until he is ready to leave the party that Ryan remembers he really is having company - his pal Wade.  They have shared many women in the past. maybe they will share Angie too.When Angie and Ryan arrive at his house. they can't keep their hands off each other.  A knock at the door interrupts them. and Wade is suddenly on the scene.  For the first time in his life. Ryan has to face unfamiliar feelings. and the fact that he doesn't want to share Angie.This is a very erotic sexy story.  The chemistry between Angie and Ryan is to die for."
8,"I haven't used the product long enough to evaluate whether or not it will help my dog's hip dysplasia. however I can tell you that it has caused HORRIFIC gas. Bad enough that I had to put my dog out of my room in the night (wher he usually sleeps) because it was almost gagging me and was hard to breathe. He has not had a diet change. the only thing changed is I added this supplement to his regular food. so it's obviously the supplement causing the gas. Not sure how long I can handle the gas. but I will give it some more time to see if it helps his hips. as he really needs that."
1,"I suffer with very very dry eyes. They sting a lot and I frequently have to put drops in them. Recently the drops just weren't doing it for me anymore.... felt like someone glued my eyelids open and sat me in front of an industrialized heavy duty fan. I had to take frequent naps daily just to help with my stinging dry eyes. I got headaches when I read or stared at the computer too long cause of persistent stinging. For my 'Dry eye syndrome' this is the FIRST and ONLY product that has really helped. My eyes are no longer red. They do not burn. they do not dry out quickly.I still use liquid drops but maybe only once of twice daily and this is only because I am afraid my eyes dry out again.This product is worth the money and I highly recommend it."
9,"I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years.  I have lots of knives. as I'm a collector but this is my go-to blade for just about anything from fishing to cutting up boxes.  For the price. it's hard to get a better knife.  I still use my old one after 15 years. even though my wife bought me this new one last Christmas.  There's no reason to ever second guess whether or not you should buy this knife.  It's a no brainer.  The newer one changed ever so slightly. but for all practical purposes it's the same one I've been using all these years.  Just get it.......trust me!"
4,"Ghidorah (also known as 'Ghidrah' in the U.S. edit of the film) is a merciless three-headed dragon from outer space with the abilities to shoot lethal electric bolts from its mouths. and it will have to take the combined might of Rodan. Mothra. and Godzilla to defeat it! A very enjoyable movie. It starts out a bit slow. but once the film starts to get going. it has possibly some of the best and most exciting action scenes out of any Godzilla movie. With a really good story. four monsters. one of them Ghidorah - my favorite Godzilla villain. it's hard not to like this one. This film also features Godzilla's transition from bad guy to good guy and the last one in a long while to be taken mostly seriously. A great movie that would be a shame to miss out on.Highly Recommended!"
4,"I have many copies of this movie. I pass it on a lot..I use it in teaching religion classes all the time..Jesus is not a solomman who walks around in majesty...He is a person who loves the people he heals.he laughs.he is charismatic.he cries...he isGod....He is the Jesus I always in visioned.....If you aren't afraid to take Jesus off his holier then thou shelf and placehim in the human world of laughter.love.and pain...and still be the Son of God. I suggest this movie."
9,"The soap smells nice. lathers up easily and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. I am a firefighter and after being exposed to smoke from burning plastics etc the smell stays with you for a day or two. I use this soap and it seems to get rid of that nasty smokey feeling after the first shower. I have it in my locker at work and in my shower at home. I will probably never buy any other soap at this point. I like the tip from others about using a foaming dispenser...will try that for sure.I dinged it one star due to the preachy label. I peeled the label off as soon as I got it since it only has a few lines about the actual product and ingredients. all the rest is like scripture. If religion is your thing. good for you. but I don't need it in my face and I don't need a religious message on the stuff that I am paying for."
4,"'...'The Passion of the Christ' has caused plenty of controversy. just like the ministry of Christ did and still continues to do to this day. When a faith-oriented film has such an emotional impact on so many lives and creates so much discussion between millions of people with different religious backgrounds. you know a must-see feature has been made.' -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder'It's the same story the Bible's been telling us for years. but Mel Gibson did a truly awesome job of bringing it to people in such a real way.' -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-FounderFor the rest of our reviews on this and other faith based films. check out cruciflicks.net where 'We don't judge people. just the movies they make.'"
4,"Because it certainly desrves it. Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney. this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift. but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl. and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age. you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.That is what indicates real staying power. not how many toys one can invent. market and make profit from."
6,"These come in one of those standard cheap plastic containers which is always a bummer because you end up needing to put them in something else eventually.  However. the price was great for a 30 count of various sizes.  The only size lacking is the very large ones which I do have occasion to use when I'm unable to use anything but.  That or sit with a whole puncher forever and put them into a binder.  The shipping was quick and they were in pristine condition when they arrived.  I haven't as of yet had a problem with them not being durable which is big bonus so great material."
10,"I bought this belt sander to help strip the barn board floors in our 1870 farm house.  The unit worked very well to strip 85% the lacquer that would other wise instantly plug up may dewalt pad sander.  I have used roughly 20 of the 40 grit belts so far and only had to adjust the tracking only three times during heavy use.  As far as the bag unit provided I have not tried it as my wife had bought a small shop vac years ago that had the right size hose to attach to the exhaust port for instant dust removal. I did have the dust collection unit plug up once but I did use a large shop vac to blow air backwards through the sander and it cleaned out the plug instantly.  Overall I'm very pleased I bought this sander."
10,"I have used my Magnum industrially for over 20 years. Never needed service (I did replace the cord) and never lacked for power. The variable speed works well. The chuck holds well.Do realize that this drill has a lot of power and if the bit catches the drill will twist violently and could hurt your wrist. Use the side handle! Keep it with the drill so you will not get lazy and try to do without it cuz you don't want to go and find it.The 1/2-inch chuck is a real blessing as there are lots of bits. especially those included in the good sets. that require that size. Also. many specialized industrial bits are 1/2-inch only.Corded drills are still required for most heavy-duty tasks and they certainly are more affordable. This is the drill I know I can recommend to anyone who needs the power."
5,"This is a tough unit. easy to set and locks tight.  The materials are robust.In a home studio there is never a lot of room and I didn't want a big boom hanging off the other side of my mic stand.  This fit the bill perfectly.  On the package there is an illustration of this being used at the end of a long boom to hang a mic in the perfect possition. and yeah. one could totally do that with this.This is a simple device and no corners were cut in its manufacture."
10,"Have hung my share of drywall over the years (not as a pro) and always used either hammer and drywall nails or a cordless drill with a bit to drive screws.  This drywall screwdriver really speeds up the process--even for a small room.  It does take a while to get the hang of it. however. because unless you drive the in screw perfectly straight. it won't seat properly and you'll have to back it out and try again.  I'd practice driving a few screws on a scrap of drywall first to get the knack of using it and to adjust the depth setting for your job before beginning work--the screw should be just below the surface of the paper so you don't hit it with a taping knife--if the knife &#34;clicks&#34; on the screw when you go over it. you need to set the depth a little lower."
8,"At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically.  It definitely doesn't get chewed down.  The material is very. very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth..  However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls.  Me I don't like it. but the dog does and since she doesn't chew on it obsessively. unlike other things I'm not too worried about her teeth."
5,"i use to use my hands to turn the tuning pegs and let me tell you that takes forever to take off strings and put them on. also my wire cutter is getting messed up from cutting strings and now that i have this i can change strings faster and i dont have to look for a wire cutter all the time.its small and can fit in the pouch of a guitar case also for people who are new to guitar you dont use this to tune its to put strings on and be careful not to over tune because you will break strings.hands will always be the best when you have to do precise tuning. this is just to get the tuning in the ball park and then using your hands."

I bought 6 of them. and set the combination the same on all of them to make it easy for me to remember (I only have to remember one combination. and I do not have to worry about loosing any keys).  This is an excellent feature.I also like that it fits on my shotguns. pistols. and rifles.  You can not see it in the picture. but when you separate the two sides of the lock. there are pressure pins that catch the trigger mechanism to ensure a tight and secure closure on the trigger.  Very good design at a great price."
3,"On the Edge will keep you on the edge of your seat as you read this hot story by Kallysten. On the Edge is a short story about a couple. where Brett is the owner of the On the Edge Club and has an apartment above the club with his silent partner Lisa.  Although the club is new in town. it is an instant success as humans and vampires gather to party together.Lisa. a vampire goes down to the club to party and feed. Leo. a vampire from her past appears and she brings him home to play with Brett and her.  Brett is surprised that he likes what the three of them do together. The next morning Leo isn't sure how Brett will feel but the surprise ending made this a perfect short story.  On the  Edge may be short but it is packed with emotion and lots of hot vampire sex.The author supplied me with a copy of this manuscript with no request for a review.  The views expressed in the review are my own."
1,"I have been using Ayr Nasal Gel for the past two years at bed time and have found that it keeps my nasal passages open throughout the night and it has eliminated the stuffiness I had before discovering this product.  I buy it in quantity from Amazon and save substantially from retail pharmacy's.  I can't recommend it more highly. especially after this winter.  Since it has been unseasonably cold making keeping adequate humidity in the home next to impossible with humidifiers and even warm mist vaporizors. Ayr Nasal Gel has provided relief that otherwise would of made my sleeping through the night extremely difficult. A small amount at the bottom of each nostril is all one needs to use and a tube will last for a reasonable time making it a cost effective means verses nasal strips."
11,"If you're new to Munchkin. I recommend checking out the original Munchkin and its reviews first for game play. mechanics. and feedback.  Especially my review.  It's a good one.  (Shameless self-promoting - I have no pride.)Munchkin 2 is an expansion of the original Munchkin.  It's not a complete game in itself.  It provides no new variants to game play. no extra aspects to consider. no new rules.  It's just more cards.  More items. more monsters. more humor. more cool stuff.BUT... more cards means less card repetition which makes the game more fun and definitely increases the replay value.  And the new bits of humor on the cards is worth the extra cost alone.  Size (of your deck) matters.Munchkin is awesome.  Buy this.  Buy it now."
4,"I first rented this when I was about 15 &amp; my mum went apes**t. A movie about a guy who kills people with a blowtorch. COOOOOL! However the blowtorch isn't that big a player in the movie. This is your typical Vietnam vet revenge story ad nauseum. Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds &quot;life&quot; to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes. including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed. and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder? I'd advise you not to eat a hamburger while watching this movie. Worst of all though is the godawful country-western song which plays during the opening credits. Yeech!"
1,"I bought this product today because it was recommended by my mother.  I got a spider bite on my temple and it caused quite a bit of swelling. So much that I couldn't wear my glasses because the head of the bit where the venom comes out was right where the band rides on my glasses.  The bite was causing pain and the Absorbine Jr. has helped.  It stings a bit on the wound but that is followed by relief and the relief lasted for a couple hours.My mom uses it for mosquito bites and says it's really good stuff.  I have to agree."
8,"I've owned a Chuckit! for over three years. and I can't imagine owning a dog without owning one.  They are durable. inexpensive. and a great aid to throwing balls. especially for we women who don't have the upper arm strength of you men.  They also allow me to pick up the ball (any standard tennis ball will fit. though it comes with a two toned ball) and throw it again without bending over. and you need not touch a slobbery. muddy. grass covered wet ball. I can throw a ball at least 3-4 times farther with the Chuckit! than without one.  They are very common among local dog owners. and the dogs love them.  Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy.  I only wish I had invented it!"
9,"This was a great surprise for the money.  I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out. At this price why not?  I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.  The door anchor worked great.  I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.  This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I highly recommend."
1,"This is a stable and excellent product. The quality of the blades are very good. subsequently it serviced my needs MORE than the other ones I had. There were no RUSTING whatsoever and the quality of shave was very COMPACT with low irritation. A very good product to buy. those looking for a reasonably priced fitting blades. At Amazon - the price is excellent for this product. Just update - I left quite a few of these on med. cabinet (which is slightly damp) and returned after 3 months back. NO RUSTS."
3,"This is a short story that give you an insight to the series of On The Edge .. Brett owner to a club that not only caters to Vampire but humans as well.. and his girlfriend of 11 months... And how Leo well you gotta read...There is a M/M. M/F. M/F/M scenes not graphic...I found the book to be interesting and different... Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series...I received to book for an honest review and with being a spoiler I found the book to be 4 stars. thanks"
3,"A little ho hum.  Joanna is a great heroine who really needs a break.  Aiden is her break.  He is a super nice guy but the I can never love again because I buried my heart with my first wife has been done to death.  He comes from a dream family with the exception of one brother who i assume will crop up in another book.  They're all kindness and light.  The good people from the church however are all mean and backstabbing.  Could someone explain to me why in all these Christian books the church goers are gossipy hags who have fun hurting peoples feelings.  Anyway it is nicely written and has some real charm going for it.  But don't expect originality."
8,"I have a senior maltese who is prone to knee problems.  He began experiencing pain in his legs when jumping on and off the couch so I decided to get these for him to help with his joints.  I give him one each day and I have not seen him limp or yelp in pain ever since I started giving these to him. which has been over a year.  The best part is. he loves the taste of them. and when I open up the baggie. he gets super excited and starts wagging his tail and licking his lips!  I knocked off one star b/c I have noticed that some bags are not as fresh as others (no I haven't tasted the product myself but the fresher products are softer and the older ones are harder)."
8,"This product is great for about 1-2 years. Over time. the motor will get bits and pieces of your pets' fur and food. which causes the motor to break down. even with regular cleaning. I found no way to purchase a replacement motor. so I was really bummed (as were my cats!).I ended up purchasing a new fountain. but upgraded to theDrinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. I highly recommend that fountain because it has a small guard that blocks food. fur. and other particles from getting into the motor and its' reservoir."
10,"If you've got a lot of wood that's the same width to rip. this featherboard is a great help!  It locks onto an iron table like a suction cup. and is hard to move without using the built-in cam.  The built-in cam makes it easy to move when you're ready to reposition it.Here are the only things I don't like about the product:1)  If you're not doing a lot of repetitive cuts. it's sometimes more trouble than it's worth to set it up.2)  If there's ANY dust on your table. the effectiveness is immediately reduced.3)  The plastic holddown makes a loud SLAP sound when you push the wood past it.  You get used to it. but it does cause one's attention to be diverted sometimes. and that's not great.Having said all those negative things. however. I'd rate the tool 4 stars out of 5. and I use mine on my table saw at least 2 times a week."
3,"Kasey and Garrett are twins who happen to be both gay and public figures. Garrett is an out gay actor and Kasey a basketball player who isn't ashamed of his sexuality but is hesitant about comming of for safety reasons.Gram is an openly gay club owner in the city the twins live in. Garrett frequents the club more often than Kasey does but Gram has a crush on Kasey.This is Kasey and Gram's story and it is a good one about find love and working to hold on to it even when it doesn't fit your 'ten year plan' to have it now.Kasey and Gram find ways to be together without to many problems and Gram is an amazing partner who respects Kasey's need to not be out to the world.A very good short story that delivers on many levels with some pretty hot sex scens"
11,"The game comes in a sturdy box with good quality tokens. cards and dice (even though it's made in China). Good re playability vale. The theme is good. and the game does not take long to finish once you get the hang of it. (max 60 min. win / loose). Great game to play solo too. and so far I have beaten the game twice and lost half a dozen times. but it's still fun to play (unlike the Death Angel : Space Hulk card game. which has less than 20-30% chance of winning. but that another review :) )."
10,"I have used this sander in many ways it was not intended. Abuse after abuse it keeps running. I would have given it four stars because the dust bag is somewhat cheap and does not attach properly but then I dropped it 2 stories on to a paved driveway. Not even a dent. Up to five stars. I have used it non stop for hours. I should have bought more sander for the tasks but it was there and I needed a sander. When I do finally get a random orbital sander I will get another DeWalt."
4,"I really wanted to buy a kickboxing video that would not be too complicated. As a user of other Kathy Smith videos. I decided to purchased this one. The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout. Unlike a lot of Kathy's other videos. there are no modifications for lower or higher intensity. but since it is not a standard floor aerobics video. it really isn't necessary to do so. If you are looking for something different to add to your routine. this is a good choice."
6,"I've used Avery labels since my days as a mail clerk. way back in the Carter administration.  They have always offered a top-quality product. and the Easy Peel line for laser printers are no exception.These labels are just so wonderful; by using word processing software such as Microsoft Word. one can easily select the 'labels and envelops' option under 'Tools' and up pops the correct format for the labels.  Just start typing or import addresses and you are ready to go.  I'll admit that the most use I've had on these labels are for Christmas cards and hand writing labels. but these would be great for a small business.Recommended product; another winner from Avery.  They work well. perform well. and don't screw up the laser printer.  As good as it gets."
6,"These 1' x 2 5/8' labels have many uses. I've been using them for quite a while. and they've always performed perfectly. They stick well and they don't smudge.Also. although Avery says that each sheet should only go through a printer once. who works like that? I've done sheets printing one label at a time. with no problems at all. If you do that. I'd recommend starting with the bottom row of labels and working your way up. Of course. your laser printers might be different from mine. so your mileage might vary.The labels now have a 'Pop-up Edge' for easy peeling. but I haven't used it. since I usually print one label at a time. The pop-up edge facilitates peeling of an entire column of labels at once. However. I've never had the slightest bit of trouble peeling labels off individually.They are excellent labels. and Avery offers software and/or templates to make it easy to print on them."
8,"I received the bears (bought 2 of them) yesterday and I gave my 9 month old puppy Macie(Pug & JRT Mix) one of the bears. She had the pocket pulled out thru the head where the squeeky is within 30 min or so. She continued to play with the bear but also the pocket and the squeeky is just about destroyed....lol...she has a tendency to destroy every squeeky in a toy. so this doesnt surprise me. A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear. Let's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces. I'm still looking for a toy that she cannot destroy and I haven't found it yet. I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped 'Macie approved'"
8,"I just received this product and I ordered it for my dog&#8217;s food. I bought a 30 pound bag that I&#8217;ve been using and then filled in this container but it over flowed! (My dog eats Natures Recipe for adults) So right of the back a little FYI. Also the door for closing has a little snapped and it has a place on top to put a lock. Since mine was full the door is snapping back open.I ordered this product because it looked convenient to take the food out and I liked the container size. The size is the only reason why I&#8217;m thinking about keeping it but I&#8217;m not 100% sure right now."
9,"We use it for our camping knives...a long blade machete and a 4.5&#34; fixed blade knife. It keeps them nice and sharp. I also love that the cover snaps onto the stones to create a handle. therefore saving space...perfect for outdoor utility.As someone who works in a professional kitchen and has experience sharpening knives. I know that it's easy to wreck your blades if your not sharpening right. I wish this stone came with thorough instructions. but it doesn't so be sure to read up on the internet to make sure you're doing it right!"
5,"Super low capacitance- on par with or better than many of the more expensive cables from Mogami. Canare. etc. The connectors are fantastic and they come with Planet Waves' super-handy elastic cord wrap. These are outstanding guitar cables at a VERY good price. I used to only buy cables with serviceable connectors. but with these. I don't see the point. The lifetime exchange warranty also makes the DIY repair thing kind of pointless too (of course Amazon's return policy is still 30 days. so be aware of that- you'd need to mail it back to the MFR or take it to another dealer to exchange - that is if you ever had to)."
4,"This is one of the best films I have seen on God.  I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God.  Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen. sure. then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning.  How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell!  Also I just purchased the DVD: 'The God's Aren't Angry' another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!"
1,"I have used this product for years. I don't have a heavy beard. and sometimes I shave in the shower. so I usually don't clean my shaver with this product more than once or twice a week and it works fine. I can definitely feel the difference after my shaver has been cleaned using this product.I agree that using this product is not inexpensive over time. but to me this is just a cost of maintenance (like periodically changing the oil in my car). Also. if my shaver has had heavy use without using this product (like when I go away on vacation for a week). I use a brush to clean out the shaver before using this product."
11,"I tried playing and my eyes glazed over and I was so so lost; meanwhile 6 kids sit down figured it out and can't quit playing.'Oh. take a halfling from Matt'' I have borrowed swords.''Does anyone have a plutonium dragon?''Do you have a wandering monster?''I have an illusion card.''I have a nasty drooler.''Can you kill it?''You'll trade me 2 treasures for that?''Is anyone a warrior?''I'm a warrior; I would give you... no. I'm not going to trade my warrior.''Let's take a level away from Matt.''I could make you an elf. Madi.''I'll just try to run away. I mean what's the worst that can happen. I'm dead. So. I can just escape from it.''So. you lose your helmet.''Hey can I be a girl instead of a boy?''Are you a cleric?'If you are looking for a great gift for a 13- 16 year old (which is probably the hardest age bracket in the world to buy for) you should consider this."
8,"I have a 7 year old Maltese. and a nine month old miniature schnauzer. The size of these treats was fine for them. and after some initial reluctance at the unusual flavors (pizza and cheese. with chicken and beef being the normal flavors) the dogs seemed to like them. However. the day after I began feeding them Scooby Snacks the Maltese began throwing up. and the Schnauzer had alarming. unnaturally colored diarrhea. It did not immediately occur to me that it might be the treats. but the next day when the symptoms continued I stopped feeding them treats altogether and all upset ceased. Nobody else seems to have had this problem. perhaps I simply got a bad batch. but I am not willing to try these again."
10,"I'm crazy about these blades. blades that perform exactly as promised. I made some cuts with my Bosch jigsaw using regular blades. Then I switched blades and made cuts in the same materials with the Progessor blades. I was awed. The cuts were easy. fast. and smooth. I even made some cuts in the wooden garden ties picked up from Home Depot. I usually cut these with my chain saw. The ties were no obstacle for my Bosch jigsaw armed with Progressor blades.I've used these blades on plywood. planks. garden ties. and 2' PVC pipe with equal success."
5,"These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine. I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use. I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers. or put undue stress on your guitar. Not only that. but they sound great. Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass. I love how they color code their strings on the 'ball ends'. To me this makes it much easier when changing strings. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands. Give these a try. I think you'll be satisfied."
11,"This game has a lot of moving pieces and is rather complicated to learn.  It has different 'quests' that the knights of the round table can complete for points.  At the same time. the evil doers are competing against the knights to get points as well.  What makes this game interesting is that each player has to complete a 'good' action and an 'evil' action at the same time.  That is to prevent the team from easily guessing who the traitor is.  The pictures are fun. the game board complicated. but there is lots of opportunity for strategy.  The game cards have interesting actions on them.  Takes lots of time to play and needs dedicated players but fun in general."
5,"I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano. which is what I'd always used. Doesn't have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion. a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing I've found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals."
3,"This was a mildly interesting. slightly humorous. day-to-day chronicle of a very boring guy's life. I found the historical insights engaging. and some of the daily activities of people in those days interesting. I wish that there had been a little more about the wider events that were happening beyond just the writer's activities. But. then. that would not have been in concert with the title of the book. The author certainly believed in truth in advertising. The title of the book says it all. It's a quick read and never complex."
10,"This is a life saver. and delivers as promissed. but is way over priced for what it is.I cut a lot of yellow pine. which wants to pinch behind the blade.  I've had to shut the saw off too many times in the middle of a cut and pray for no kickback.  That is why I knew it was time to invest in one of these before something went wrong.  After ~30min setup on a Grizley 1023SL. I can't believe that I didn't buy one sooner.  It is so easy to add and remove the splitter. that you keep it on the saw!!!  The only drawback is the price.  Considering it cost half of what the saw cost me. it was hard to pony up that much cash.  But I must say. that it is still cheaper than one trip to the ER."
11,"This is the updated Fantasy Flights version of HTMF. This game portrays you as a hungry penguin on the hunt for tasty fish. In doing so you must round up your fish before any rival penguins claim it for their own. Your game board per se consist of 40 hexagonal tiles and always changes. Some might complain that this takes awhile to set up. but if you have some help with your other player(s) set up is a breeze. Fantastic game. great price and best of all the WIFE loves it!"
1,"This is the replacement foil and cutter for the Braun Syncro line of men's electric razors.  Braun recommends that you replace the set about once per year.  I am a gentle user and can get slightly more usage out of mine.  Your foil and cutter may also last longer if you lubricate your razor with something like Remington's lubricant.  The Syncro's cleaning system will also lubricate the blades for you; however. the cost of replacement cleaning cartridges make that an expensive option.Basically. you do not want to wait until you have a hole in the foil to replace the set.  A hole in the foil can result in your face getting a cut from the oscillating blades beneath.  So please. change your foil and cutter set regularly."
6,"It has an eye-angled. upright display. and is perfect to work on a desk. The keypad is not as soft as other calculators on the market. giving you a retro and reliable feel (if you have ever used those full size desktop calculators popular a decade ago. you know what I am talking about.)I find other calculators (e.g.. Sharp EL-377T) awkward to use on a desk. They are perfect for handheld. If you want to have a calculator on your desk and operate with one hand and without leaning forward to check the LCD screen. this Canon LS-82Z is perfect for you."
5,"This is my second order of the 10 pack. A local store wants 29.99 for one set of these. The feel is really good in my opinion as opposed to all the other brands I've tried; including. and especially the most commonly used eb's. I have however had a slight issue with certain D strings. On occasion. it looks as if the winding is chipping off. but not at the frets. I change strings quite often so it really doesn't matter. Not sure what that's about but it doesn't affect anything and like I said this IS my second order of these so I gave them 5 stars. Any less and I'd look dumb."
5,"I bought this pedal at a local shop and use it with both guitar and Bass. I usually put it before a distortion pedal and my original Phase 90. or use it as a standalone with an old amplifier to even out the signal. I do notice it is more effective with the guitar than bass. but that is typical. I usually do not turn the compression knob past 12 o'clock. but when using a chain of pedals. the compressor helps even out the lows and highs. The pedal seems to interact with a wah in good ways also. For the price. it seems like the best economical choice for compressor pedal out there and the MXR pedals are built like tanks. I have had this one and the Bass model for years and they hold up great while showing their age well."
10,"I've had my Delta planer for quite awhile now. In its lifetime it has had hundreds of board feet of hard and soft wood passed thru its portels. Much of this wood has been some of the hardest stuff on the planet. Mesquite. Quebracho. Vera. Mistol and white Oak just to name a few. I am on the first edge of my second set of knives. As in all planers. knife adjustment is critical. and with these knives it is as simple as tying your shoelace. Knives are sharp enough to shave with out of the pkg. and the locater holes make alignment a snap. Getting four cutting edges for this price makes the whole package a five star unit. I've had my problems with some Delta products. but this isn't one of them.Love the planer and love these knives. Highly recommend."
5,"This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar. the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul."
8,"I have used Frontline Plus on all my dogs for years. It works great on my toy poodle and bichon; who are indoor 22/7.Now for my other dog a pitbull mix.. he gets ticks 3 weeks after I put in the application. I thought the ticks were suppose to die when they bit the dogs skin. but these ticks don't die! they feed on his blood :.( it gets bad. He stays outside 16 hours a day. I dont know why front line doesn't work with him. It works great with my other dogs."
1,"Even so. they last a long long time and the extra price is offset by the fact that you would be paying more to buy a comparable quantity of the other shorter-lived batteries.However. when they die. they DIE (I have found that they don't temporarily refresh themselves like the shorter-lived batteries do. when I turn off my camera and then turn it back on after a few minutes) -- so keep an extra pair (or however many you use in that specific device) on hand for the day the inevitable happens.And I believe that Lithium is more earth friendly -- and if I am not mistaken. these can be recycled????"
5,"On my mixer. I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip. return on the ring. and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4' TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return."
6,"Before the age of checkbook register smartphone apps. I dutifully turned to this calculator to balance my checkbook. I'd tried other calculators. but they were either too small. the keys were too close together. the display too small. or something else made them less than ideal. With this one. it stays in place on my desk. it has a large display. the buttons are laid out intuitively. it goes well with my modern decor. and it has both battery and solar power. This calculator would be good for home of business use. but would not be suitable for a student since it does not come with a case and probably would not stand up to being thrown around in a backpack. locker. or desk."
1,"this wax is awesome. its soft and easy to apply it drys on clear and will hold my mustache for a good 10-15 hours without me having the fix it.only complaints are that sometimes it irritates my skin or drys it out. and the container it is in normally ends up getting damaged or a hole in it since its metal and will eventually just get a hole in it from squeezing or folding the tube. ussually happens to me when the tube is 50-75% gone but it will dry out inside the tube fast when it happens. Ive been through about 4 of these in a year and it happened to all of them."
11,"This is a very fun and educational game.  Players use cute trains to build 'tracks' across the US to different cities completing a card that details what cities need to be linked to get points.  Its very easy to learn.  The only thing is that it can be complicated to score the game-we tend to do it at the end of the game rather than trying to do it during play.  This is one of the few games that is fun with just two players.  Very Entertaining! (ticket to ride Europe is also fun)."
6,"The first time I purchased Scotch Gift Wrap Tape was three years ago at Christmastime.  I saw it in the drugstore. thought it looked interesting. and decided to treat myself to something new/different.  I immediately became a big fan of it: it blended perfectly with my wrapping paper. virtually disappearing.  I was impressed with how nice it looked.  And. like regular Scotch tape. it was very strong and very easy to work with.Nowadays. this is the only Scotch tape I buy.  It's perfect for everything: home. office. crafts. and of course gift wrapping.  The price is the same as the other types of Scotch type.  It works just as well. if not better.  And it's made in the U.S.A.  What more could you ask for?This is one of those simple. elegant. no-frills products that gets the job done. and done right. every time.  Give it a try. you'll love it."
4,"Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic. rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas. I meant Happy Holidays!"
4,"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur 'The Fonz' Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts. he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it. as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."
9,"This is the little brother of the DMT diafold.  Very light and small.  I keep one on my keychain.  The extended length when open. is an aid to keeping a constant angle.  I have never had one come apart but I suspect they are not as durable as the diafold and are not available two sided (two different grits) which of course. would be heavier.  Mine seem to be rust resistant for use with water to wash away metal dust which would otherwise accumulate on the surface.  These Mini Sharps are not for any work heavier than edge maintenance.UPDATE 9/7/2012:-- The molded-on flanges of the plastic handle broke off when I tried to unfold my Mini-Sharp. No more than normal force was applied.  It is now in two pieces.  I want an item like this to be dependable. Lowering my rating to one star."
4,"This is the best film I'm ever seen. It is more than a movie. seeing 'The Passion of the Christ' is literally a spiritual experience that will not leave you the same. You will be changed one way or the other after seeing what Jesus suffered. The realism of this portrayal captures the historical context of the days Jesus was on earth. Use of the original language adds to the authenticity. Similarly the ethnicity of the actors adds another layer to foundation of capturing history on film.This is an instant classic indeed. Any objective viewer who sees it cannot deny this fact. It is 'other.' i.e.. it is in a category of its own. Yes it might be listed as a 'religious film.' but it is so much more. The artists. producer. writers. creators who put this work together had the help of a Power beyond their abilities."
9,"I got this for my father-in-law for Christmas. The knife is a smidge bigger than what I would have liked. however. it does have all the basic tools I would want in a Swiss Army Knife. After reviewing multiple knives I don't think there is another that has this convenient a set of tools. There are others with more bells and whistles. but I wouldn't want to have anything bigger for daily carry. If you are willing to sacrifice some tools there are smaller knives. but then you find yourself missing things when you need them. This knife is a good balance in the middle. Quality is what you would expect from a Swiss Army Knife."
4,"this is from the series of books that spawned the wizard of oz film.in this one.the lion must find the ultimate icon of good or something to that effect.i belive its a flower.dorothy is along for the ride too.the witch has a evil icon that spreads evil to everything it touches.only the flower can stop the witch.the kids like it some.its a fantasy/adventure type deal.the wizard of oz movie was far better than this cartoon.ive never read the book but i think it would be quite excellent.id love to see the other books turned into films also."
5,"I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it. but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick. sweep pick. tremelo pick. tap with the pick better. Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me. Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^.^"
3,"I finally read this book last month and enjoyed every chapter. It shows how they managed to survive on the island by making tools and items in their cave. This book is by far one of the best 'stranded on an island' books you could hope for. It is probably one of Jules Verne's best. The inhabitants of an island are banded together and when they get into a tight spot. there is a mysterious force that always helps out. This force is not revealed until nearly the end. I highly recommend it to everyone."
3,"I really can't say I loved it. It was good in parts and than slow and boring in others.  My biggest problem with the book I think has to do with the heroine. Yes. he abandoned her and so on but after he explains his reasons which were understandable you would think that the wife at some point would understand too. but nope.It takes 245 pages for this 2 to actually get together. After they finally get to lie together something else comes up and we have to read another 100 more pages for this women to forgive him again. The story and the idea is not bad the last 40 pages were quit good and romantic but before I reached those I actually struggled to continue reading."
11,"This game is very easy to learn (I don't understand any of the negative reviews saying it's &#34;too complex&#34;) and lots of fun. as long as you're not the big loser in any particular game. Imagine getting hemmed in and locked down in Settlers of Catan. multiplied by 100. That's how frustrating this game is if you happen to choose the wrong path cards which (unbeknownst to you at the time) conflict with someone else's ambitions. Satisfaction with the game is very hit and miss. as it can be VERY tedious when you have no chance of accomplishing your objections. Part of the appeal of the game is also one of its biggest drawbacks: you can easily see how well you're doing compared to everyone else. which means that you can also tell very easily when you have no chance at all of winning."
1,"I have been using another. more viscous. product for quite some time for dry eye. I tried this and liked it as something to use in between. because it is thin enough. it does not blur my vision. However. it is too thin for much protection now that the heat is on in the house. so I use both. alternating them. I have a bone to pick with the makers. though. They designed the little containers (this is preservative free single containers) with a funny grip that often blocks the liquid from coming out. which is very frustrating and not good for use while driving."
3,"I really shouldn't have enjoyed this as much as I did. I felt just a tad guilty. Anyway. I did enjoy it. I felt like it took them some time to understand each other and even then there were hurtles. I think they both allowed pasts to cloud what was happening to them which could have really been handled if they just talked to each other. Hunter was a jerk to start but I think we all get to place where once we begin to be hurt by the world we feel like it's better to hurt them before they hurt us. Lila was too damn sweet at first. I wanted her to have a life of her own. I was glad her father talked some sense into her. I enjoyed the story and would read it again."
10,"A two foot square smooth cast iron table top combined with a very smooth spindle makes this machine very easy to work with. I measured the spindle runout to be 0.004 inches maximum for all spindles. except for the 1/4 spindle that was 0.013.My lower rating of only 3 stars is due to 3 quality issues. The top came with chemical stains. but was smooth and usable. I had to re-wire the switch... minor but should not have been required. And third. the table inserts are not flush with the table top. This can cause a piece of wood to catch as you are sanding with a resulting cup or glitch. Jet is sending me a new set of table inserts. but I have a feeling it is a poorly machined table top. I could easily shim the inserts. but for the price of the machine I expect it to be right and I want JET to know their quality control is slipping."
8,"Previously I had fed our Lhasa other brands of food rolls in different flavors but after trying Redbarn Food Rolls. our four-legged companion voted her favorite flavor as Redbarn Beef.  I alternate morning and evening food between the food roll and kibbles. The 4-pound food rolls are so easy to store in the fridge and for long-term in the freezer.  I slice a whole roll into 1-inch slices and then halve them before dividing into two containers - one container for every day and one container in the freezer for future use.  I stick with the Zukes Mini Treats (all flavors) for bribes and training treats.  The food roll is boxed with bubble packing and arrived within a day or two after I placed my order."
3,"The first concern with the paranormal romance genre is whether it is believable enough.  Could I suspend my disbelief?  Yep.  Worked for me.  I liked haveing the bundle because I plowed through these pretty fast.  Each book centers around a man who for genetic and psychological reasons is outcast but loyal.  So... this could take place in Medieval times. a police force. or on a ranch.  The conflicts and the subtle character traits are the best part.  I also like that the danger and mystery element held up.  Sometimes its just a way to get the characters in bed.  Oh. there's that too. but the human element and the well-painted scenery makes these wolves &#34;real.&#34;"
11,"A D&D; themed euro game. What more could you want? :)Lords of Waterdeep is a worker placement euro game through and through. You will be placing your 'agents' out in waterdeep to recruit clerics. fighters. wizards and rogues to help you complete quests. Each Lord of Waterdeep has a specific objective for you to complete. like focusing on certain types of quests. You get points by completing quests and bonus points if those quests are of the type requested by your Lord.This game has similar mechanics to Stone Age. Caylus and other worker placement games. but if you like Euro games and D&D;. this is a great one to pick up. It plays in as little as an hour and even though the box says 12+ my 9 yr old plays it with ease."
5,"I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals.I don't use this on my pedal board and don't know if I would recommend it for heavy live use. I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here.It does work well and will power many pedals at one time. I do not use it for powering only one pedal though. This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals.I also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet.Easy to use - it is what it is."
3,"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book. I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that. however. was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book. things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys. other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States. and. the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who. in this instance. are prepared to be generous."
9,"These bands are some of the most well constructed I have seen.  They also have clips on the ends which allows them to be used in tandem. so the red. black. green. blue. and yellow can all be used together for extra resistance. which is a major plus for athletes who need more resistance.  The door anchor included is a very simple design. but it works well.  All of the bands also have a lifetime warranty. just call them and they will ship you a new one (you have to pay shipping though).  The handles are well constructed. and the wrap around handle is pretty standard universal gym type stuff.  Will buy from this company again."
9,"I really like these bands for travel workouts. They take virtually no space in your bag and provide enough resistance for a respectable workout. It's hard to quantify how much weight each one represents. For a thorough workout for each muscle group. it pays to get the extra heavy. heavy and medium bands. Honestly. it's good for some muscle groups. like the triceps. biceps. shoulders and even the back. I haven't used the door attachment. but for the chest. good old-fashioned pushups will do the trick on the road. won't they? As you adjust your foot position on the rubber. you increase or decrease the resistance. Certainly worth the money. as many hotels have sub-standard guyms and 15 minutes with these bands can work you out just fine."
11,"Bananagrams the game is ok. not great.  I guess some people like it. but it's not my cup of tea.  What this is to me is a great set of tiles in a portable bag.  I use the tiles to play another game. Snatch-It.  Snatch-It is a much better game than Bananagrams. but it comes with terrible tiles.  They're harder to read. and there's not nearly enough vowels.  Buy Bananagrams. buy Snatch-It. use the Bananagrams tiles with the rules from Snatch-It."
5,"Some things just don't need to change. Some Wah pedals try to tempt you with built in fuzz. eq. or other wacky add-ons but WHY? I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great. The Crybaby is a great effect to have for any style; everyone from Jack White to Jimmy Hendrix have used some incarnation of this pedal. It's a must have and that's really all there is to say."
6,"This is a basic stand for a monitor.  It's just a curved metal tube with a metal plate affixed to the top.  The first one I got was defectively assembled -- the metal plate on top was crooked. badly out of square.  I returned it. and the replacement is much better.The color is a sort of metallic black.  There is a gray Allsop logo painted on in raised letters on the front right part of the tube.It gets the job done and looks decent enough."
5,"Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas. but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks. depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance. I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood. really - to support the instrument from the bottom. The top hanger now just serves as a rest. but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward."
9,"I'll start by saying this knife may be small. but it is sturdy. It is perfect to carry on you keyring as it's small size won't make your keys excessively bulky and yet it has everything you'd need for day to day uses. It has a knife that is great for cutting small items (string and packaging etc) and although i've had mine for years it is still as sharp as the day I bought it. The scissors may be a touch fiddly but they are sharp and function well. The file and screwdriver have also come in handy at various times. These knives are always well made and their reputation is well deserved. they manage to be aesthetically pleasing. easy to use and sturdy all at the same time. no mean feat. A good entry level swiss army knife and perfect for small jobs whilst out and about.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,"If you like Christmas movies besides 'The Nightmare before Christmas'. you should add this one to your collection. If you don't like Christmas movies then buy 'The Grinch' or 'The Christmas Carol' and see what you act like Grinch/Scrooge. In my humble opinion this is the best telling of Rudolph's story in a musical. Many added side stories with Hermey the dentist. Yukon Cornelius. Abominible Snowman. and the Island of Misfit Toys adds to make a great story. The animated figures are excellent and smooth motioned. Excellent narration by Burl Ives. The music is first rate and will have the family singing along."
6,"They're push-pins. They do what you'd think that they would. There seem to be about the proper number. but I certainly haven't counted. My only gripe. and why it's 4 stars. is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic. two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright. but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except. doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them. and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container."
5,"This little gadget is perfect if you want to stand back from your mic stand just far enough to make it comfortable to play your guitar while you sing into the mic.  The usual solution is to get a boom to attach to your stand but this works and it's simpler. less expensive and takes up less space.  The pivot is controlled by a friction joint which you can adjust.  I wouldn't try to use it if I were a singing drummer. but for a guitarist. it's great."
9,"I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me.  Right out of the packaging. this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable. but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also. the product description says that it is designed for 'spin bikes' and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes. so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike.  However. it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it. even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible.  This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs. which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times. but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand."
8,"We have an 85-pound dog and use 1.000 bags per year (3 per day). There is no denying how good these are. as described by other reviewers. It's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task.What bothers me though is the extra plastic and expense involved with these. Taking into account environmental and economic factors. I prefer to use the smaller and thinner120 Earth Rated Dog Waste Bags. Lavender Scented. 8 Rolls. 120-Count.So what we do is keep both items on hand in a fanny pack. For the biggest or messiest 'jobs'. we use Mutt Mitts. For typical 'duty'. the above linked product is very good. That way everyone wins!"
11,"I LOVE the illustrations on these flashcards. That is what prompted me to buy them for my daughter's second birthday. The cards are very sturdy and have a nice weight and finish to them. My one issue is trying to keep them together. The ring that holds the card together is kind of flimsy. There is value in having the cards be detachable but I almost wish the ring was more permanent. It can be frustrating when you are missing cards. Overall. these are the most attractive. charming ABC flashcards I have ever found. I think I may have been a little too eager though because my daughter is only 2 and she doesn't seem that interested yet. But if you want some nice sturdy flashcards with charming. frameworthy illustrations I would buy these."
10,"I bought this tapering jig prior to tapering my first table leg. It was inexpensive. I was inexperienced. 'nuff said.  The surprise came with its performance.  Although I am confident that I could bend this thing in half  if I was in the right mind. it does a really good job of guiding my  workpiece through the saw.  The adjustment feature is simple and easy to  use. but the &quot;graduated scale&quot; is a bit hard to use accurately.  To set it up. I simply adjust it by eye and then measure from the blade to  the trailing edge of the guide.  This trial and error usually takes no more  than a minute or two. and the jig stays locked on my final setting for as  many cuts as I need to make.  Although there are nicer. more expensive  versions out there. you cannot beat the value for the money with this tool."
10,"All the reviews of this and similar Fein blades are true; they cost a lot and they are fragile and easy to break. I am now faced with the prospect of replacing some of my broken and dull blades and I am willing to pay the price because I must. I have invested over a thousand dollars in blades and sandpaper for the Multimaster and the capabilities that having this kit gives me are too numerous to mention. My advice is to use this particular blade as a last resort. those few instances when no other method can perform the task without risk of peripheral damage to the valuable stuff that we tradesmen and tradeswomen have to cut into. Fein blades are like auto insurance; they are an expensive burden when you don't need them but when you do. you will be very glad that you have them."
5,"These are great strings. They are the right length and go on easy enough. They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on. sound bright. and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever. you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less. that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book. Worth the extra pesos."
10,"This finish sander just isn't up to Makita's standards.  It works well when new. but lacks durability.  Even in a non-professional setting. it just doesn't last.  The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place.  The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order.  It does sand well. I just wish it was more solidly built.  If you need a solid finish sander. you're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models."
6,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects. particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface. making sure to burnish the labelssecurely. then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design.and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly. as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool. but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course.this is only one idea. but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
1,"This is the only ovulation test that works for me.Note: Make sure that you don't test your first pee of the day. Test your second. as long as you only have one or two cups of coffee. or whatever you drink in the morning that's not water. Also. you have to try to wait as close to four hours as you can from your first pee of the day. Then. your reading will be more accurate.Regarding coffee. Google how horribly caffeine is for fertility. A recent study showed that it's not cilia that pushes the egg through the fallopian tube. it's a group of cells that contract the tube and push the egg along. In mice. caffeine inhibited that. The study said that's only one reason they know of now. They know it really affects fertility. but they still don't know the entire reasoning behind it. I digress..."
4,"This is an enjoyable telling of how Santa Claus became who he is today. Keep in mind that this story is completely fabricated by the minds of Rankin/Bass. not the real history of how the myth of Santa Claus evolved. With that in mind. it is quite inventive.Where did he get his red suit?Why does he go down the Chimney?What about his reindeer and his 'Ho Ho Ho'?These questions and others are all answered as a young boy grows to manhood while a despotic mayor forbids toys of every kind in his town.It's not quite the same storytelling level as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. but it is done well enough."
11,"With this kit you or your child(ren) can write up to 12 pages of text. each with its own illustration. send it off to the company. and receive a professionally printed hardbound book in a few weeks.  There are even options to get gift books. each with its own unique dedication page!  An 'About the Author' section really personalizes the experience.Everything you need is in the kit -- instructions. paper (including practice sheets) and pens.  There's even a postage-paid envelope. so when you're finished writing you can just drop it into a mailbox.  We could not be happier with this product.  It was fun and easy. brought out the kids' imagination. and the product we received was beautifully finished.Highest recommendation."
9,"I bought this to mount on my muzzle loader. It has the ideal magnification for deer hunting in heavy cover where things tend to get up-close and personal.  At the price I paid I didn't expect to get much more than the minimum.  This scope is much better than the minimum.  Light transmission and clarity are way above average.  The size is just right and the build quality is terrific.  My boom stick kicks like a mule but the scope hold it's zero tenaciously. I wish I needed two."
9,"I bought a few of these for my family.  I think I still prefer the rally over this model since it gets rid of the scissors and adds a screwdriver instead.  Still. there is a reason why this is a &#34;classic&#34;!  You won't be disappointed with this small keychain knife.  I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys.  The one keyring it comes with will cause the knife to sit perpendicular to your keys. adding bulk."
3,"In these stories everybody smokes.  The courtesy of offering a pack of cigarettes is common. The characters are classic 50s people. as are the social proprieties. The illustrations are highly representative of the 50s science/fiction dime novel. and the magazines of that time. Although he was not the first to deal with the principle of multiple time lines. I think he was the first to base a series of stories on the concept. These have not aged well. but the science behind these stories are still valid. I will have to admit I read these stories after Fuzzy Sapiens. his masterpiece. and one of the top books of all time. certainly in this genre. We lost a great storyteller prematurely when he left us."
8,"We were having a grand time with this toy. and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance.  That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who &#34;Chucked it&#34; as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever... Ok. so that's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there. but buyer beware: You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car.  It really depends on where you live."
3,"I have never read this author but I thoroughly enjoyed this story and would gladly read another.The disfigured Hero's fear. pain and pride were wonderfully described and I felt myself wanting to reach out and gently touch his scars to reassure him -at exactly the same times Aidan touched Warwick. Don't get me wrong. Warwick was a brutally strong hot male character-but we were so privy to his thoughts within this story that we began to get those protective feelings Aidan acquired. We saw the extremely handsome man Warwick really was.The passion and romace are well mixed with so much strengh and wit from both characters that sometimes you're not sure who the real Hero should be in this story.For everyone who likes the strong-take matters into her own hands Heroines--this is definately the book for you! She is a one WOMAN rescue squad that is the perfect match for our mysterious- masked hired guard Warwick. The sex between them is hot and wicked as well.enjoy!"
3,"This was an excellent. fast paced story that I didn't want to put down.There is a small issue with formatting that I almost deducted a star for. but I just couldn't do it as it did not hinder my reading much at all. It's only a matter of sentences dropping to a new line in the middle and not having page breaks between chapters.  Annoying. but not debilitating.The characters here are vivid and believable. The writing is succinct and graphic.This was a steal for $.99. I will definitely be watching out for more from this author."
4,"There's so much debate about the violence of this movie that it may scare some from watching it. But Mel Gibson makes it known that he doesn't want to elaborate on the physical suffering of Jesus as much as he wants to elaborate on the courage and strength of Jesus to do God's will. Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe. But the last scene of Jesus resurrection gives hope and almost purges those feelings of despair. This movie depicts true Love and Hope through even the most darkest hours. Other than some rather cheesy scenes and some overdramatic irony the movie should remain a classic for it's indie aspirations and block buster accomplishments."
9,"I have carried one of these on my belt for over 25 years and recently left mine on the tailgate of my pickup and drove off without thinking. I lasted three days bare of my Victorinox and couldn't go any longer. The price is a little spendy but trust me you won't even give it a second thought after you use this tool for a month. It is extremely well made. engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants. I don't go 24 hours that I don't use this tool at least a half dozen times. It has it all and then some. The steel in the blades is exquisite. The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp. I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw. Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime."
8,"This is my second review for Duckworth and I still feel that this duck is worth every penny. It was the favorite toy of our dog that died at age 13 and it is the favorite toy of our 5 yr old dog that we adopted after the first one died. The dogs couldn't be more different in personality. but they both have loved this toy to pieces. literally. It doesn't get chewed apart but is so well loved that it looks terrible and is starting to fall apart. so we buy two each Christmas and save the second one for mid summer when it is time for a new Duckworth to appear."
5,"Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar. and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway. it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands. but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these."
1,"First of all. the product is well tolerated and I am very pleased.  Secondly. to all of you whiners that complained about the packaging: iron is a metal that can. like most metals. kill you if you overdose.  There is no antidote.  An OD can do irreparable harm to your liver.  It is a slow. agonizing death. I do not have children. but I understand the reason for the safety packaging.  Most OTC medicines will not kill you if OD.  This one will.  So. look at the bigger picture here and don't overly focus on only yourself.  There is a simple solution. It is called scissors.  Personally. I don't think they are even needed.  The packets are a little difficult. but if you persevere. you might even find that you develop a little character (a virtue) in the process.  :)"
5,"I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use. I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own. And every student I've ever had. has one on their guitar as well. They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding. They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time. they can be easily removed and relocated. After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. No matter how many picks you store. or for how long. the spring action loader never loses its resistance. I highly recommend these. I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product. If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks. this is the product for you."
10,"I have owned my Dewalt biscuit joiner for many years and it has always performed great.  The initial setup is very easy and I can make dozens of biscuit holes in no time at all.The only complaint I have. and its a small one. is the dust bag.  It does fill up kind of quickly and will sometimes spill out. especially when its filled with fine dust from MDF panels.  Wood seems to have lots of curly-q pieces that stay in the bag.  I found that if I empty the dust bag after every ten holes it works great.  Emptying the bag is very fast. so its not much of an inconvenience.Its a great tool that has held up well under repeated use."
3,"I have read four of the six books and I have no complaints. I love. love. love. love the sappy love stories and Brenda Jackson capture my interest every time. I like the way she sets up the story line of a person not looking for love and then can't help but fall in love. The stories  for me are truly what love should be like. Every character we can relate to in some type of way.Also. I love series of family and friends. Keep up the good work!!!"
6,"I think it's a little pricey for 200 sheets. but then again with Prime that includes 'free' shipping.  We use a ton of paper at our tutoring center. and I prefer the wide ruled for my students. especially the ones in elementary school.  The wide ruled lines give the young writers more room to express themselves in words and numbers.  For math activities I'll sometimes turn the paper horizontal with the lines running up and down. This can help students visualize columns and be better able to list numbers one below the other.These sheets of paper have red margins on both sides for convenience of application. For those who look for it. the Mead filler paper has the  certified sourcing imprimatur."
9,"Overall: Highly recommend for car campingPros:durable enameled steel exterioreasy to set up and operatecompactCons:flame control/adjustment not greatPurchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals. Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove.I am very happy with this stove. as it has a nice heavy solid feel. and seems very well constructed. The heat output isn't fantastic. but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions. As others have mentioned. the flame adjustment isn't the greatest. but then again most camping/backpacking stoves aren't either. Love this stove. highly recommend and would buy again."
6,"3M is a company that makes high quality products; although. rarely a cutting edge innovator.  A lot of its products are incremental improvements on its other products.This is one of those.  3M already has a tape that is see-through when it goes on.  This product might be marginally less opaque. but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.  So. while this is perhaps incrementally less visible once applied than other nearly invisible 3M cellophane tapes. its advertising blurb causes one to apply this new nearly invisible tape at the height of anticipation.  One really expects the stuff to virtually disappear once applied.  Alas. no such thing:  The stuff is still plainly right there if not. perhaps. as plain as day.So. while this product may be marginally less visible than its other nearly invisible tapes I don't think it is anything to shout about.Still. another excellent product from 3M."
3,"Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends. werewolves. vampires. the like. as beings of an alternate dimension. Gates allow them passage to out world. Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down. building such as Stonehenge. the Indian mounds of the Americas. and other such structures around the world. But as humans spread and built. those impediments were destroyed. weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world. In their own dimension. they are far down the food chain. In our world. they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing. cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests. cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains. there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families. the Masons. from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event. and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent."
1,"This chapstick has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.  My mom put this brand in my stocking when I was maybe 10 or 12.  I;m 42 now.  It was years since I had seen it anywhere.  Whenever I did. I would buy it up!  I was greatful for the internet and Amazon!  I buy a box full a couple times a year.  Be cautions. my son is a chapstick addict because of this stuff.  He has worn it daily for years.  He says it is a real addiction. lol  This is not your typical sticky. waxy chapstick.  This is smooth and softening. Excellent for dry chapped lips. with overnight releif and healing.  I haven't checked the safety of the ingredients.  I don't think that I want to know...."
6,"This is traditional wide-ruled. three-hole paper. Exactly the quality you expect from Mead--decent thickness with clear. crisp lines and edges--and ideal for grade-school to middle-school writers. If wide-ruled notebook paper is what you. or your child. needs. this is as good as. or better than. any other option. With one caveat ... It's the kind of thing best bought on sale. because off-season or single pack purchase can be absurdly pricey: 4 to 5 times the price of the same goods at better times (like back to school events)."
9,"This is the best scope iv ever had. I put it on my HR single shot 204ruger. It shoots dime size 5 shot groups at 100 thanks to the adjustable objective. It extreemly clear and has great low light transmition. I use it in PA for coyote. fox hunting at night. With snow on the ground its like having night vision although I have a bright cree light atop the scope. It is clear from 4 - 12 and it just looks good. My freind uses a Nikon prostaff 4-12 and we both agree this is everbit as good and even better because of the adjustable objective. Wich his nikon does not offer. I have already taken 1 coyoe 75y. 1 grey fox from 125y. and a coon from 22y. I did miss another fox but it was my fault. Amazon sells this for wayyyy less than any store and with free shipping!"
5,"Good length but very slippery.  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around.  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now.  For the price. why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric.  As far as the base product. it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear."
6,"While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together. it shows up very easily on gift wrap. being all shiny.  The matte or satin finsh on this is perfect for gifts..  doesnt attract or reflect light. so that you see the wrapping paper and not the tape. Very simple and it works.Con:  this type of tape is really for gift wrapping and isnt as attractive for normal everyday use. but it can be used as such.  Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion."
11,"A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat. Fun and easy to learn. this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family.We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening. Sometimes just my husband and I play. Other times our elementary-aged kids join us. A single game takes 15-20 minutes. perfect before bedtimes.What we really like about this game:1. Very portable.2. No board needed. just a flat surface3. You can change up the words you spelled. so you are rarely really stuck.4. Takes only 15-20 minutes to play a game.5. Playing involves spelling. strategy. and quick thinking.6. Rules are simple to learn."
4,"Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai."
1,"I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks.  I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month.  That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back.  What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same. 1800. and my body. which fights me to gain. will be happy with the lower weight.  One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol. it's doesn't work anymore.  I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis.  I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate."
1,"Bought these for some trail cameras taking videos. with sound. field scan etc.  Are holding up well (better than new Alkaline)  and the price was great. They also have a listed Shelf Life of 15 years. and are supposed to last 9 times longer than Alkaline batteries with high drain applications. I recommend the product and the seller Brooklyn Battery Works.  Purchased some more of these from Mel Pierce Camera (an actual store but on Amazon too)  at a cheaper price and they were delivered fast. Reason I mentioned the sellers is due to what appears to be some scammers selling them . Both these sellers are fine. fast. priced fair. new in the package."
5,"My review is on par with all the others concerning the quality of the cable compared to cheaper ones. I bought this locally and have been happy using it with a few bass guitars. The cable is solid and definately seems to hold up after a few weeks of heavy usage.One complaint I have is that the right angle does not lock into the jack on my Spector bass securely. but works with the others flawlessly. I use it with a jazz bass all the time and there are no issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables and Mogami and think that this one is worth it's price. To me. the warranty is worth it because of the price. I reead all over the web about the opinions of monster's patents and marketing techniques written by musicians and can see their points about the price and build quality. but there are more expensive cables out there made by Mogami and countless others which are not any better than this one in my opinion."
3,"For whatever reason. Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The 'Tales of...' are great in that they explain background characters. However.Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work. this is mostly a book of action. not intricate plot development. In fact. the story ends with an exciting twist. but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love. or included a really interesting plot twist. Also. just to note. this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version."
8,"THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS!  I bought this for my Airedale's crate at night.  I thought it would be nice to radiate a little heat  (during these chilly winter months)  under her top towel. and on top of her cushion and blanket.  SHE LOVES IT. and has a hard time getting out of bed in the morning!!!  This disc is very hard. but she doesn't seem to mind (and I put it under a thick towel).  It actually stays warm for about 8-10 hours.  and I microwave only 5 mins and 15 secs. which is slightly under the recommended time for my microwave.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
3,"After seeing the recent major movie. I was prompted to pursue re-reading the original series of novels. I found them to be highly entertaining and as captivating as when I read them long ago. The writing is good. if a bit 'dated'. but Burroughs can still hold your attention. His writting may seem a little juvenile to some but I (at 70+) was thrilled time and again as I read them on my KIndle. I recommend them to all who simply wish to read a series purely for the entertainment value."
9,"It is convenient and packs up well for car camping.  The stove gets very hot. and is great for boiling water.The stove does not do 'simmer' particularly well.  Be careful with anything that needs lower heat settings.  Using a cast iron pan or high quality aluminum or copper clad pan helps.  Attempting pancakes. eggs or a side dish requires very close attention.I would say that overall this is a good value. but there are better units available.It does have good wind resistance to it. which is a definite plus outside."
10,"Other reviewers are correct. this is a terrific little sander with one problem. the switch is tricky to operate.  The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best.  Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task. this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production.  Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent. noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders.  I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable (with no dust collection) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC.  Highly recommended."
8,"If my dogs like like the taste of Purina One and they eat it. then there is not more that I can say except I trust Purina products. I am always looking out for the best products at a reasonable price and through the years Purina products have provided food that is healthy and balanced. at a reasonable price. and most importantly. my animals like the taste. Most of our dogs and cats live to their teen years. with two of our cats living to 19 and 20 years old. this I think I it in part due to Purina products."
12,"I bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience.  I was not disappointed.  It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind.  I don't mind that it is not wireless. since I wouldn't move around much anyways.  Also. the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me. mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate.  I do think it could have been packaged better. but I don't fault the microphone for it.  Overall. a very simplistic. yet functional. design that works well."
8,"My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT.  Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received.  The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal.  It is all angular and sharp points. My dog wouldn't even touch it.  She even know the difference.This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we wouldn't know the difference.  I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them.  From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance.  Very upset with this kind of business practice.  All nylabone products ARE NOT equal."
8,"I use it to pre-treat my carpet in heavy stained spots. but it's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there. Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again (no way. it takes too much time). I just spray this and clean it off. I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula. not to mention its scent is even better. If you own a puppy or a pet that isn't fully housebroken yet. buy it. You'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner."
5,"Addario strings are ok.. Although like beauty it is in the eyes of the beholder... Aquila seems to be the most popular now. I have used both and I am satisfied with both...I play the soprano. concert. tenor. and baritone. Each one different in it on right...Also play the the concert scale banjolele.. Only been playing the uke for 5 years and the banjo for 10 so it is only IMHO.  Be aware though that 10 years experience can mean 1 year experience 10 times:))))"
4,"This depiction of the last 12 hours in the life of Jesus Christ is certainly powerful.  For many. myself included. the crucifixion of Christ had become little more than a part of the window dressing of Christianity.  The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify. and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith.  Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible. gritty reality.  This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment. not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.  I am not a Christian. but I feel that I have gained a greater appreciation and understanding of the Christian faith for having seen this film.  This is not a film to 'enjoy.' but it is a powerful experience that has something to offer to anyone with an open mind."
9,"tips:1. the lantern burns brighter on white Coleman fuel2. gasoline is A LOT more dirty then Coleman fuel so try to pre-filter the gas before use.3.gasoline will gum up the lantern in storage VERY quickly.so dump out the gasoline after your use.4.if you burn gasoline a lot make sure to pack an extra generator(a lantern part)because they tend to plug up much quicker then with Coleman fuel. the generator is cleanable if soaked in parts cleaner or 'seafoam'.5. if you need 'directional light' cut a thick foil pie pan to the same dimensions as the globe.but make it only wrap half way around the globe(it will stay in place by being pinched between the shade and the mantel metal bottom. this will give you about 200 watts of directed light....perfect for Sasquatch hunting or signaling the mother-ship.that being said; these are great lanterns and simple enough to repair and pass down to your kids....a rare product characteristic nowadays."
12,"This game was a very fun game. You basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings.. each one leading you into a different world... and in every world... you have to find 7 stars... (one of em is the 100 coin star where you need to collect 100 coins then it pops up it's the hardest star to get)there's 16 worlds in all... most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it.. This game right here is history... It's one of Nintendo's biggest hits... and when you buy this game you'll soon find out why:)"
9,"If you have the extra money...buy this for the fun of it. It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act. and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it. but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe. fun. easy to assemble. kids and adults will enjoy."
1,"The National Brand of the best working Lactase Tablets - they get the job done--i.e. preventing embarassing dashes for the nearest lavatory. which can be a pain if you're taking the train. particularly as it tends to be rather drafty in there and on cold mornings any trip where one has to run down a long series of connecting cars just to partially disrobe to read a newspaper and pretend that's all you went there for- which allows you to be comfortable and not have to make the weaving sway-bumping into others -as you fairly leap down the cars to the necessary--only to find it &#34;occupied&#34; - is a good thing to have on hand to use instead- make sure you take it WITH the dairy product - not after and not more than 1 minute before eating ...(heed my advice on this -or- don't say i didn't warn you)."
6,"I've loved the trimline phone ever since I got my first phone more than 20 years ago.  Then. the trimline was a real. Bell System. telephone.  Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones. it still has the great. comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset. which makes it an excellent choice.  I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone. but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T; version.If you read the other reviews. you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.  Yet. here we are in late November 2004. and its still around.  I'm guessing (could be wrong here) that this phone will be around forever. even though AT&T; no longer promotes it on their web-site."
5,"I bought this set mainly because I wanted a cheap micro-fiber cloth to polish off my guitars.  For the price of just a microfiber cloth. this set throws in a polish.The cloth is just what I wanted. It is soft and I feel good rubbing it on my instrument. I wish there were a little pouch that came with it so you can keep it separate -- mine is right now in a ziploc bag in my basement with my other loose gear.  The polish is just that -- it is works to bring out a shine. but it is not a cleaner.  You also have to be careful about where on your instrument you get the polish; there is a bit of wax in there and it is not string-friendly."
3,"This story is very short (think novella). but it it's very well-written and the plot moves at a nice. quick pace. This is a great. easy read for a few hours (especially for the beach or that plane trip).The story revolves around an estranged couple. a misunderstanding. and a cute and funny revelation at the end.I don't really understand the negative/mediocre reviews. because I personally loved this story.  I get that everyone has their own opinion. but if you're a fan of adult historical fiction. you will definitely enjoy this!"
3,"The story idea was sweet. with a hunky editor who is trying to convince his prized writer to start writing erotic novels.  Given that this is a new genre for her. they engage in a little erotic research under the premise of helping her writing.  I liked the characters and the scenarios. but I expected a bit more eroticism and a little less sweet.  It seemed as though the sex scenes were a bit on the vanilla side compared to other books in this genre.  Still. a light and entertaining read."
9,"People complain about the lavender smell.  Yes it is STRONG when you smell right from the bottle.  Actually using it as a soap/shampoo it leaves a very faint smell.  You just have a nice clean smell with a hint of the lavender.  I have used Dove body wash for years and this is a much better product.  It doesn't have the lotion that products like Dove contain. but it has a really nice. clean. refreshing feel and smell that is hard to beat.  No lotion-like residue like the Dove... but still the skin is pretty moisturized.It doesn't foam up quite as much as most commercial soaps. but you actually use about the same. or less. of this product to get the same level of cleanliness.  Plus being fair trade. environmentally friendly. and having an ingredient list that is actually comprehensible is a huge plus.I will never go back to Dove... and will stick with this unless I end up finding something superior."
5,"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo. but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos.  important to take it off when not in use so the 'rubber' does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another."
6,"The tape - at first I wondered: 'How can this be different?'. The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss (satin if you will) finish. For a 'tape collector' I guess it is slightly between 'magic' and clear tape.* Not a big deal to me and most people. but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered 'photo safe' I guess that means it won't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has."
4,"Are we Jaded? Rate this product. . . We EXPECT what we purchases to BE.  To work without difficulty. without oops. without interruptions. to provide the intended use. When we receive and get the EXPECTED. we might sigh a sigh of satisfaction. More often we might not even raise an eye brow. Then we do not give of that satisfaction to the seller for providing so much to our enjoyment.This movie was checked to be in excellent condition and valued to be Worth a price and worthy of giving entertainment.This movie was packaged securely to survive the transportation from safe storage to me.This movie was sent with confidence that it would arrive into my care quickly and safely.All this required a seller that paid attention to basic details. that produced a successful transaction for both the seller and the buyer.This brings buyers back to sellers again and again.I am a happy buyer and look forward to doing business with this seller again.Clear"
1,"I have a 2 year old who still doesn't sleep through the night.  Since I was still nursing and periods weren't SUPER regular I would test around the time I get my period every month just to BE SURE there was no way I was pregnant.  I really felt a calm seeing that negative every month.  Crazy I know.  Well. Feb 4th I got a positive.  A definite positive.  Pretty shocking since we were using protection and I thought it had to be wrong.  I tested and tested and went to the doctor.  It wasn't.  Anyway. I can't believe I got a positive so early.  This test is super sensitive and truly is &#34;a first response&#34;.  Due in October and while I still can't believe I'm having another...this product did the job it was intended to do!  Great price too!  Especially if you subscribe!"
12,"Well here's the lowdown. the twisted fighting. plot. and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time. it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister. Grasshopper.

Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso. the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition. and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game"
8,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers.  The cats loved it and so did I. for the first 6 hours.  The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake. caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours.  I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier.  Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked.  This is true! C'mon you engineers.  This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on.  Great idea but a real mess to clean up.  It is getting returned tomorrow.  :("
8,"We have used Frontline Plus for several years on our dogs and never had an issue.  Never seen a single flea or tick on them.  I have a lab who loves to dig and roll around in the grass and sand. and I haven't had any problems.  Last year we decided to try the new generic equivalent to save a few bucks since we are buying for 2 dogs.  BIG mistake.  We pulled off several ticks.  As soon as we could. we went right back to FP and haven't looked back.  It is worth the little extra money (there is not THAT huge of a difference in price) to be sure our dogs are safe from fleas. ticks and all the other nasties out there."
1,"I am old enough to remember &#34;The Fuller Brush Man&#34;.  After the Korean War. many veterans sold door-to-door for the Fuller Company while they were trying to get back into civilian life.  The &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34; came through our neighborhood several times a year.  Since I was the one who usually opened the door. I got a good dose of his wholesome first impression.  He carried a large well worn leather case.  When he opened it onto our living room floor. a fantastic array of brushes would spill out.  My mother always bought something.I guess OXO somehow fills the gap left by the missing &#34;Fuller Brush Man&#34;"
1,"Purchased this for my adult son who has excess sweating; he was so grateful; 'He was like Mom it really does work. thank you!'  Sometimes moms have to research products for adult children as they are where we were years ago. raising young children. working and just don't have the time to get helpful information that will solve their problems.  Anyway. it worked for him...Be sure that whom ever uses this product. that the directions are read carefully as it is not to be used like a deodorant.1. Use at night before bed (do this twice in a row)2. Then use every other nightDon't quote me verbatim. just read the direction for yourself before using. as I'm sure you would like to get the best use from this product.  If it does not work for you see your physician for a stronger version of this product...Good Luck!"
12,"This is the origanal Gameboy Color its not some crappy SP this was amazing due to all the colors on the screen and the size was better than a gamegear for sure. Most of the titles are great and take full advantage of the colors  many people say that it's not that great only because there is no backlight.but who cares anyone remember the Gameboy Light? And how did that turn out. horrible nintendo did mot want to take another risk like that and they were right backlights and graphics don't make a game console*cough gamegear cough* its the games for the console and these games are awesome so if you want dust off your old library of Gameboy color games go for it youll be sorry if you don't"
1,"B000050FDE: Oral-B Professional Care 1000 Power Toothbrush  Am pleased as punch with this dental device. which puts others to shame.  In fact. the soniCare 1126 corpse that it replaced is patiently waiting for proper disposal.  I don't know if toothbrushes have chemicals in them which would pollute the environment if given half a chance.   I don't recall when the Philips soniCare was first used. but even at first brush. it never performed as well for me as the Oral-B.  Different strokes for different folks.   This Gold Box item leaves my mouth feeling super clean each time I use it. and I particularly like the double-head brushes.  Thank you. Amazon. for making this available to me at an 'irreteethable' price."
1,"I've been using my Braun shaver and the refills for almost a year and a half. Like others. I thought the refills might last longer by cleaning my razor every other use. I eventually realized that the refill didn't last any longer. so now I use the cleaning function after each use. I get a fresh shaver for each use and feel as though I'm getting my money's worth from the refills. One note...I always save the cap/top of the refill. If you're planning on being away from your cleaning unit for several days or more. you should cap the refill. You're refill will last longer as you won't lose any fluid to evaporation."
9,"This thing is amazing! I go on river floats basically every other weekend in the summer and this is used as the beer barge where we keep our shoes. coolers. keys etc. Not only does it admirably hold all the weight loaded into it. it has so far remained completely damaged even though people repeatedly throw crushed beer cans and bottle caps in it. I've only used it a couple times as a person floater but it had ample space for me (6'2&#34; -185lbs) and I didn't feel like it was going to sink. I've also not used the oars yet. If I were going to make this purchase again. I probably would look at getting something that could hold two people for me and a friend to go play around in the creeks etc but I'm not sure that they make anything as cheap as I want that does all that. I highly recommend this boat and the full Intex line to anyone looking for river float craft."
9,"I like the Speedo Hydrospex Swim Goggles. They have a snug. relatively comfortable (for googles) fit and won't leak if you follow the instructions on the package. These Speedos look good in the water and provide decent visibility. I find the tinted versions too dark to see underwater.  I have used these clear goggles for a year now. and after about 30 uses.  there are no durability issues so far. These are nice goggles at an affordable price. better than the cheap ones I had as a kid that leaked all the time!"
3,"Rachel has come back to Cougar Falls in search of a new beginning. The legacy from her beloved Aunt Charlotte couldn't have come at a more fitting time.Burke Chastell just wants Rachel to collect her inheritance and sell him the land so they can find the totem that protects Cougar Falls before the rest of the world discovers not only that it exists. but all of its secrets.Rachel's Totem by Marie Harte is HOT!  I enjoyed this story more than expected. Since it is part of an ongoing series. I was afraid I would be lost and confused. but I wasn't. I had no problem following the story and motivations of the characters. There was an unexpected m&eacute;nage. but it was definitely a fun one. I will be checking out more of Ms. Harte's stories after this one.Elysiareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
5,"I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes. plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to. is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly. there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6' pop filter.  If you don't. you'll wish you did."
6,"Make note that this product is for laser printers!  Great product for office or at home use.  If you have a mass mailing to do. you will find Avery templates and labels extremely useful.  These products come with Easy Peel technology to make sticking the labels on envelopes even easier.  Anytime you have to print labels. look to these Avery labels.  A good value for your money.  You can address 750 envelopes with just one package.  Do you know how much time mail merge. a printer. and some avery labels will save you.  You won't be disappointed!"
3,"GREAT ADDITION TO THE LEARNING CURVE OF THE KINDLE.  Just finished reading the third edition of this book. I was surprised about the little tidbits that I didn't know about!!! My Kindle is used only for downloading books via either my computer or Whispernet from Amazon and of course reading them. I am not interested in using the Kindle for anything else so a lot of the book does not apply to my uses. But those that do are worth the small amount charged for this book. It is a bargain. Even my dogs are happy that I have converted over to the  Kindle since the pathways they use were growing smaller with each new book brought home."
4,"I was pleased to see in the extra features that Dr. Ben Carson was on-hand to advise in the production of this biographical retelling of his autobiography. He is a gifted speaker and writer. but I had hoped that they got the story right. Read the book first if you can; it's a page-turner. The movie leaves out some of the faith stories of Dr. Carson. making it a draw to a wider audience. But make no mistake. Dr. Carson credits God with all of his success. pointing out that it was his Christ-following mother that prayed for and encouraged him to reach his potential. taking him to church and teaching him in the way he should go--even as a single parent."
12,"This game is really fun. but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more. One thing that annoys me about this game is that you can't look behind you. I pressed every button and I can't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming. So nine out of ten times. I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64? It's still a nice little game. a little pricey. but still nice to have in your N64 collection."
10,"Great miter saw.  Lots of capacity and lots of nice features.  The tall sliding fence is great. just make sure to slide it out of the way during bevel cuts.  The supplied blade is fine for general work but youll want to upgrade if you plan on doing any work requiring a quality cut.  This saw is easy to adjust. just read the manual as it tells you how to adjust everything on the saw.  Adjusting it took me all of five minutes and has stayed true ever since.  My only gripes concern the cost of the accessories.  They are ridiculously expensive and should be included considering the price of this saw.  I also recomend purchasing this saw at your local home center as DeWalts packaging jobs leaves a lot to be desired. One piece of cardboard is all that secures this big saw inside the box.  Other than those minor gripes this is the best 12' saw on the market."
3,"This book was my least favorite of the series. It was lacking detail in the beginning and the heroine's purpose seemed too manufactured to me. I also couldn't get my head wrapped around the alternating first and third person accounts chapter to chapter. The static characters were a little too static for me (there could have been a little more explanation for some of the behaviors or snootier snubs. And none of them ever really seemed to be resolved).The ending seemed a little scraped together as well. Having already read others in the series. I know this is just a fluke. I will say I liked the characters though. in better development of their back stories or resolutions I would have been more apt to give four stars. Still. it was a decent read. But not one I would be in a hurry to re-read."
3,"All in all a great read. I would have given this book five stars except there were some repetitive thought processes in the beginning that had me saying 'alright already - I get it... he wants to stay but he's afraid she'll recognize him and reject him or turn him in'. (reminders would have been okay. but perhaps less wordy ones) However. by nearly half way in the book it moves away from that. There's plenty of action and suspense throughout. and a nice romance to boot."
4,"The acting was fine. but I fail to see the point. We've got a guy with a thorny crown. covered with blood. hauling a cross. He falls down. Evil Roman soldiers beat him for falling down. He gets up and hauls it some more. He falls down again. They beat him again. Etc. I just don't understand why we need to see anyone. Jesus Christ or anybody else. taking such an ass kicking. What was it. 90 minutes out of 100? We need some more story here. Mel. I was glad when Jesus died so I could change the channel. Oh. there was a brief resurrection. Two seconds. sunlight through a hole in his hand. Michael resisting the urge to make a horrible joke about eating M&Ms this close to Easter Sunday."
2,"This was purchased to replace an 8 quart aluminum Presto.  The lid must have been 'sprung' because it didn't want to close.  The handles and screws were not as good as those on the aluminum Presto models I've had.  Amazon's shipping box was fine when it got here. but inside the manufacturer's box was mangled - leading me to believe it was that way before it was packed.There was a dent on the side of the cooker near where it rolls underneath to the bottom.I returned it to Amazon - they gave me a full refund.  I got aFagor Futuro 10 Quart.MUCH more expensive. but it's easily the best pressure cooker I've ever had. especially the built-in pressure regulator.  And it's made in Spain. not China."
4,"This is a great Woody Allen film.However. it is only 85 minutes long. just like every other release.The description claims uncut 91 minute version. There is no extra material.It is widescreen. but I have to compare it side-by-side with a VHS version to acertain if making it widescreen cuts off the bottom and top of the picture.All special features are only written text and only in Korean. so virtually no special features unless you read Korean.Don't buy this because the description claims uncut version.It is not.It is. however. a really funny Woody film! Buy any domestic release."
5,"Long story short. this string set has a strong metallic character. which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it. but for me. absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar. so by its nature it sounds mellow. warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out. I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position. WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes. it is that bad. you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line. I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so. definitely avoid this string."
10,"I purchased this sander nearly one year ago and can't say I have any complaints about it. The dust collection works surprisingly well. though if the bag isn't pushed in all the way it has a tendency to fall out (fault of the user. not the tool). It isn't unbearably loud although I still wear my ear muffs when using it. The vibration in the hand is low. and it does a superb job at what it is designed to do - sand. I don't know where the components are made. but at least the tool itself is assembled in USA which is more than I can say for the 18V Li-Ion drill and impact driver combo that I have as well (Makita brand) which is made in China. This is a purchase you won't regret."
6,"I never oiled my previous shredder and paid the price after about a year.  This time I bought the oil at the same time I bought the shredder.  Now I oil the shredder fairly often. maybe even too often.  The only issue I have with this product is that it's a bit messy when you &#34;pour&#34; the oil onto the shredder blades.  I cut the top of the oil container as small as I could. but oil still manages to come out too fast and get on the shredder body when I oil.  No big deal as I just wipe the excess with a paper towel. but it's worth noting."
12,"This is a very Good game. It is so good. You get to play a lot of diffrent characters. like. Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn. Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks. but they don't. Oh. weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games"
4,"After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions. and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three. but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks...."
6,"This is easily the best gift wrapping tape I have ever used. It is transparent. of course. but not shiny. like some competing brands I have used. UnlikeScotch Magic(TM) Tape 810-3PK. 3/4-inch x 1296 Inches. 3-Pack(which is also fantastic). this tape doesn't look cloudy on top of wrapping paper; it really is just hard to see. The adhesive is strong enough to hold gift wrap together. but is also forgiving enough to allow you to peel it off and readjust if need to. All in all. this is a great product."
3,"Many post apocalyptic stories are very grim. This one isn't. It has a lovely cast of characters. of beings who are trying to build new lives.The pace of the story is easy. like walk on the beach. The story starts with a wolf/human who is banished because the elders of his tribe are afraid of his ideas. On his journey he meets others: a young boy. an orphan and artist. whose body is damaged by the pollution of his former city and a female dolphin/siryn who has been helping the boy to survive and of course a very intelligent dog that they name Misschief.Many other new characters are slowly introduced.The book is infused with the love and healing power of nature. The characters are well defined and they all have a purpose. that they gradually discover."
6,"This 3 Ring Binder is well designed. Avery took what is wrong with most other binders and came up with excellent solutions such as the Pins for the Binder Ring connections. Other binders use V connections which don't always work well. I also like the Single Button to release the Rings. The curvature of the Rings makes it easier to handle large volumes of paper.The Labels are also Premium quality but I won't be using them with a printer or the free Avery software. Only reason is that I don't make that many Binder labels at any one time. But I have used other Avery label products with Avery's free software and they always worked well.If you want an above average 3 Ring Binder that can be used frequently and smoothly then I highly recommend this Avery product."
8,"I typically pre-treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning.  This is a ok pre-treat but I likeBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 ozbetter.  I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge.  I've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time.  For lighter carpets. I would recommend theBISSELL Tough Stain Pre-treat for Carpet & Upholstery. 22 oz."
3,"I became attached to the characters. I liked the series for the most part. I only had 2 complaints. The characters kept saying that they weren't monsters. that they are the same people they were before immortality (which I agree). However. the author kept calling it the dark gift. I didn't like that. It's either that they're good people just different or they are dark monsters. You can't be both. The other thing. I'm not sure how to put into words. but the author kept going on and on about the characters thoughts. For example. Jamison thought he disgusted Angelica. He kept going on and on and on and on and on and on and on (it's getting annoying isn't it?). Yeah! I ended up skipping sections when the characters did this. I got the point the 1st 2 times they explained their thoughts and feelings.  For the most part. I liked the series. Just these 2 points bothered me."
3,"Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest. A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This doesn't bother Markhat in the slightest though. He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story. it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK"
2,"I've been using this almost daily for about a month. Easy to use. easy to clean. and looks nice on the counter. No real complaints. except that the bowl feels kind of thin. like it would crack easily. I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier. I hope I'm wrong about the bowl. but I guess only time will tell. Other than that. no complaints. and I'd recommend buying this!Update 6/27/13: After three months of regular use the bowl is still holding up. and it's still doing what it's supposed to do. My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube. Obviously I knew this when I purchased it. but hindsight is 20/20."
10,"I had this for my first table saw when I started woodworking. No matter how long I spent adjusting it. I couldn't get the rear of the fence to lock solid. or to lock in the same place every time. VERY frustrating when you're trying to make pieces of plywood with square corners.This is not the same caliber tool as Makita's hand tools.It may work OK for carpenters. but compared to woodworking. they don't need any kind of precision. For that. a good contractor saw like a Jet would be good. But do spend the money for the upgraded fence. The stock fences on those are garbage too. If you really need a lightweight. compact saw. look at the DeWalt and the Bosch."
4,"My little boy knew his alphabet before he was 18 months old and isn't two yet and is starting to spell.  He's not smarter than the other kids - with parents that constantly ask what we did to teach him the alphabet - he was just exposed to letters early.  This video was a huge help and he loves to sing with the songs.  Sesame Street Know what they are doing and this collection of the best letter skits is excellent.We go somewhere almost every day and videos like this one get to play for 10 - 20 minutes and he learns on every car ride.  Mix videos like this with books and you'll be surprised at the results.I said alphabet because we used the other Sesame Street videos to learn letters.  We got the same results for numbers with this video.  He now counts to 100 and he just turned four.  He also does basic math."
2,"If you're not a cook. then you probably won't have a use for this. but anyone in the search of a superior vegetable peeler. look no further. I've had mine for over two years. and it's working as well as the day I purchased it. It doesn't dull. it peels efficiently. it's safe. light. easy to handle. easy to clean. and doesn't rust. It works well with potatoes. carrots. cucumbers. and zucchinis. I've never tried chocolate. though. It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try. I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,"I was totally amazed to find out this uses NiCad batteries that suffer from battery memory and are horrid.  I had to call Eureka and get new batteries sent. the first customer service agent was horrible and made me call back 24 hours later in the event the batteries suddenly started to work.  NiCad batteries are horrible.  The Vac itself is great. but the batteries make it not worth owning.Among rechargeable battery technologies. NiCad rapidly lost market share in the 1990's. to NiMH and Li-ion batteries; market share dropped by 80% for good reason.  With the battery technology today there is no reason Eureka should have used them except to be cheap."
5,"I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD&G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle. These strings sound great. I was thinking of stringing my electric acoustic guitar with them also to compare the two styles of playing."
5,"I bought this recently and I love it. Why?  It has no &#34;smell&#34;. it leaves no residue on your hands. it's very &#34;light&#34; but yet it cleans. shines. and polishes your guitar beautifully.  It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish. it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors. This is fantastic stuff. If you own a guitar this is the best product out there. But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson. I was very suprised that it was this effective. This little bottle goes a long way. I have already polished all of my guitars and my friend's guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left. If you need to polish your guitar look no further. This is your best choice."
6,"It might seem silly to be excited about labels but I am. I've been looking for labels that aren't a pain in the you-know-what and I've found them.These labels are return address label sized (80/sheet). I'll be using them for that as well but my initial use is for 'reorder' labels on products I sell. The printing is clear and smudge-proof. important for labels with small print that might be exposed to liquids or creams.What I like best about these is the Easy Peel feature. which will save much time and aggravation when I'm label several items (or envelopes) at once. I'll be ordering these again but with 80 labels per sheet. it may be a while."
5,"I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  I guess this kit works okay. but it's hard to use.  It will probably last my entire lifetime.  I think a smaller kit would have been better.  You really need to remove the strings when you use it. so you have to take off all the strings.  I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings. so I had to change my habits.  If you have a guitar without a truss rod. that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings. since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time. and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  I'm no expert. but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  However. since I love my guitar. I use it anyway."
2,"I was searching for an in-window fan to turn on when I'm cooking smelly foods. when people smoke in the place. etc.  I had previously had the more standard dual 8' window fan setup. and after several months of use. they always seem to get so weak they barely move air. I decided to try this one but it's not right for my intended use. This is designed to be more permanently mounted with screws/brackets. is giant. and moves a TON of air. It will pull a major vacuum and requires an open window or door. When it's off. the screen/gaps are so large taht bugs can just fly right in the house etc.  Perhaps I should have done more research before purchasing it. but hopefully this helps anyone else in my position who's in the market."
9,"I've owned my XLT since shortly after it came out. and it is absolutely the best knife I've ever owned. even better than the SwissChamp I'd carried for 10 years prior.  I work as a computer tech. and this knife has about 90% of the tools I need to fix a computer. all in a (relatively) small package that I can carry in my pocket.  It's got things like Torx and Hex bits. and the bit driver is exactly the perfect size for tightening the little nuts on either side of a D-SUB connector (VGA. Parallel. Serial port. etc).  Even the little straight pin has come in handy for resetting PDAs.  I have used every single tool on this knife except the fish scaler.  Heck. even the toothpick has proven useful!"
6,"These labels are very easy to use. The cut lines on the page are very sharp so there are not any tears or snags when peeling a label from the page. We ran multiple pages through a laser printer and through an ink jet with no problems (Using MS Word label template. This is a standard size that was listed in the software). In fact. I put the sheets in upside down in one of the printers and ran them back through the correct way and they still flowed through perfectly. They peel easily off the page so you don't have to worry about creasing them when trying to peel them off. Highly recommended."
2,"I live in an apartment. so I wanted something that I could hang over the door instead of drilling/nailing things into the wall for me to fill later when I move out. It was really hard to find! This comes with the hardware to mount if you want to. which is nice if/when I go somewhere more permanent. but honestly. hanging it over the door is working great. Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part. I ended up using a hammer which caused some of the white paint to come off. but you really can't see it and it doesn't affect function. I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
8,"My mom's beloved Bichon Frise is the family pet.  The grandchildren all love her and we'd be lost without her.  Unfortunately. she is highly allergic to flea bites.  She also cannot tolerate a flea collar.  We have tried everything for this poor. sensitive dog and finally found Frontline Plus!  We apply it every 45 days because she's mainly an indoor dog and only goes out for using the bathroom.  The vet suggested every 45 days because of her sensitivities.  It works wonders!  We just started using it May of this year (2008) and she has not had a single reaction to fleas for the first time in the 10 years she's been alive.Every dog should have Frontline Plus applied to keep them flea free!  We no longer have to put her on allergy medication.  It's been such a wonderful product for her."
5,"Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board. this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs. combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further. with the transformer being well away from the board. there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?"
10,"I have two desktop high intensity lamps - one I bought a few years ago. and one a recent purchase. The older lamp failed about 3 months ago. and I replaced it with the new one thinking the older one was finished. Then when the newer lamp blew a bulb I decided to get a set of these bulbs to see if it would work again. Replacing the blown bulb with a new one from this package took a minute or two (being careful not to touch the bulb with my fingers). and the new lamp was back to working. So I decided to try one these bulbs in my old (presumed dead) desk lamp. After carefully installing the new bulb my old lamp was back to life. They are both still working. and I am delighted with this purchase."
8,"I was betrayed by a dog 'expert' that swears by these that they're the greatest thing ever.  I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip.  The green parts are glued on. but not very well.  I don't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play.  Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread.  I felt like returning the ball with the green piece. poop and all."
2,"It's a stick vacuum. folks. So it won't do much more on carpet than collect surface debris (like any stick vac. it's not designed to. though it does have a &#34;carpet&#34; setting) or solve big cleaning problems. But it will. from solid floors. remove crumbs. most dust bunnies smaller than bowling balls. dog and cat hair. and -- for those like us who have canaries or other pet birds -- all 2.000 feathers that each one of those little darlings drops during their annual molt.What I like best is that this model comes with TWO batteries. so I can keep one in the stick vac and one in the charger so the help I need is always at hand. For the price. I like this machine."
2,"I've used a Premium grade. Innova 8 Qt. for years. It is way too big for every day. single person use. The Presto works decently. but not well built. The handles are fastened by only one screw. The lid closing stop. catches past the point it should be. The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in. Dia. Without the lid. the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in. height. the 6 Qt is only 2 in. taller making it the better option. A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top. but not the sides."
10,"I purchased this saw because I was building a 600 sq ft deck and really needed something that would work well. What a great investment this was. I can't begin to tell you how many pieces of wood we had to cut and the saw did it with ease. I am extremely happy with the results and very happy that I followed the reviews of others before I purchased the saw. Even after completing the deck. I still don't even have to change the blade. I also purchased the reciprocating saw from DeWalt which also worked great. You get what you pay for and it's worth every penny. especially when you don't have tax or delivery."
3,"I liked the premise behind the plot. mental attachment between wolf and man. as I like this type of interaction. Unfortunately. for me. the original promise of the plot never quite materialized and in fact ended up being chaotic for me with an unexpected side-step into shape shifting halfway through the book.For me. the book almost works well but doesn't quite make it. The plot premise didn't deliver quite what I anticipated. the characterization was a little predictable with secondary characters not well developed as individuals.I did finish the book but admit to skimming quite a lot of the last half. It wasn't a bad book. just not  my kind of read. Bland would probably be the best way to describe the book for me."
9,"If you Want a decent scope that can stand the pounding it takes from a .308. then this is your scope. I previously bought a Barska scope that  shook to pieces after 12 shots.  After 3 hours of shooting. and more than 60 rounds. I shot my best pattern of the day at 100 yards. and I am not that great a shot ! The adjustments are not as smooth as a $4.000 scope. bit it is not a 4k scope. and bottom line is. it worked fine for me. Two thumbs up For Bushnell."
3,"I subscribed to the Reader's Digest for my Kindle 2.  I didn't turn on my wireless between the 1st and 5th of the month. therefore. I didn't receive my first issue.  I canceled my subscription noting the reason being I didn't receive my first issue due to the fact that I didn't know I had to have my wireless on during the first 5 days of the month.  My fault for not reading more of the info about subscriptions.  Anyway. a couple of days later I received a refund of $1.49 on my credit card without even requesting it!  I re-subscribed to Reader's Digest and set my cell phone calendar alarm to remind me to turn my wireless on for my Kindle on the first day of the month so I'll get my copy from now on. I got my copy this month. Hope this gives enough information to those who want to subscribe but aren't sure what to do after subscribing. Happy reading!"
9,"Just so nobody gets confused here. this is a very small pocket knife. To be worn on a key chain. Nothing remotely what is considered EDC (every day carry). But here is why I got it: You get a small blade which is good enough to cut open little packages/string/etc. Scissors. a nail file and what I like the best....tweezers and a toothpick. None of the high priced Leatherman etc. multitools have tweezers. and if you ever had a nasty splinter you know how important tweezers can be."
4,"If you want to view an interpretation of Christ that reduces him to little more than a helpless idiot. watch this movie.  If you actually respect him. avoid this film at all costs.  If Christ's life prior to the crucifixion is missing. then the story is pointless.  His great lessons are missing.  The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line.  And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.  Here. he is portrayed as a victim. dragged around by the jew-mob (there isn't a character there. just a mass-mob) completely unable to do a thing.  The focus isn't on Christ's message. love. pacificm. or teachings. it's a sensationalist view of his suffering. which doesn't fit well with the Christ story."
4,"Kudos to RareFlixNClassic for reliable and expedeiant service. ordered (03 March 2010) same time as other products. I recieved this one 9 March 2010 and as of 10 March 2010 Amazon still has not shipped the other iteams oreder with this one. All with the super saver shipping including this one. Quick shipping. Recieved product as advetised in new condition. The movie it self is a classic anti culture movie ot its time. I like the movie for what it is and you get to see Nickolsen from his earlyer years in the buissness."
12,"I've never really had enough of an attention span to play 'collect the item' games. but this particular one is really great. It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me (with. honestly and unfortunately. a terribly short attention span) for hours at a time. with enough elements of finding things you'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level. A truly great game. and I wish more of the sort were made these days. I feel way too young to be saying this. but they just don't make them like this anymore!On a side note. the cartridge I received has some... Interesting connections. I'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha."
12,"Probably one of the best games for RPG players.  However. too expensive currently (as of August 2006).  I bought the PC version and the Playstation version years back and still have them.  The PC version does look better especially during fight scenes.  Unfortunately. for use on Windows XP you have to get a software patch for later in the game (chocobo race).  Great great game.  I would say 'shame on you' to the sellers that are charging so much for the games but I understand their reasons.Find it cheap. buy it. play it. enjoy it!"
4,"The informational content is superb but it is presented in a combination of psudeo talk show and lecture format. In addition. Mr. Barton speaks very fast and dispenses a large volume of information in a short amount of time. The result is that the episodes tend to be dry and boring. Adding to these difficulties is the fact the DVDs include the promotions for the series from when it aired on TV. As a result the episodes are interupted approximately every 8 minutes with what amounts to a commercial for the series. This gets exceptionally tiring after a short period of time. While I would wish that every high school student in the nation along and every adult citizen study this series. I think that anyone who is not seriously interested in the subject matter will find watching it to be a tedious affair."
9,"Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job. but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the 'Made in China' stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said. the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own. fit for his small hands. he is so very happy. As I write this review. he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him."
8,"Not only does my dog love this toy. but so do I!!!I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him.  He gets really excited when he hears the 'Ohhhh Noooooooo'  :-)Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun!Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup. I had taken him to work.  Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him!  I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends!The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just don't let them have those toys for long or without supervision.  When the toy gets ripped. I either sew it back up or take out the voice box.I don't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just isn't safe.If you. or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh!"
6,"I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up!  The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright.  Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder. I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure.  The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far. but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily.  I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides. or white board on one side and flip chart on the other.  Very versatile."
9,"This pedometer has a clock which resets the count every day and keeps a seven day history.  I just leave it on my belt and don't have to worry about resetting it or checking it right after a walk.  My wife has a pedometer with manual reset and she never remembers to use it.The sensitivity adjustment helps avoid false readings from car vibrations. and the aerobic steps feature is useful to determine how much exercise I'm actually getting.It is very durable.  I've worn it every day for over a year with no problems.  It also has a small enough size that I hardly notice when I'm wearing it.In summary. the combination of durability. features. size. and price makes the Omron HJ-105 an excellent choice."
2,"I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.  This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.  This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.  Pressure cookers are very safe. If you follow a few simple rules. you'll never have a problem.  I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.  Additionally. it is amazingly cheap to own. My only con: wish it was made in the USA. otherwise. highly recommend."
4,"Woody Allen's directorial debut. and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know. he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered. this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure. it has some korean styled packaging. but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie. not a commercial movie.  Beware. this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap."
6,"I recently went through my filing cabinet and purged all of the old crap that was cluttering the drawers.  The problem is that I now had a stack of very usable folders that were 'tattooed' by the old labels.  You can't tear the old labels off without damaging the tab and if you put new labels over them the writing on the old label shows through.These new Avery File Folder Labels are absolutely perfect for this situation: you can place them over old labels and they completely block out the writing on the old labels.  Problem solved!!Nice and heavy-duty. these are excellent labels.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day. so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say. Hi!') feel free to post it below.Thanks.Claire"
5,"When you need an audio insert cable. you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs. such as mixer cases with processing gear. it's simply not cost effective. and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands. but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation. while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product. Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price. Amazon!"
9,"I picked this multitool because it has the best combination of features for me: I really like having a saw. phillips head and scissors. All of the tools are well designed. The saw cuts aggressively in both directions and all of the blades came paper slicing sharp and are easy to restore. It is also surprisingly lightweight for its size; unlike Leathermans which are also great but for different reasons. If I had any complaints it would be that some of the tools are slightly difficult to access (particularly the hook - which I don't use anyways) and I think that there is space for one more tool on the bottom."
3,"I thought this would be a great book after reading the description.  But. the author has put way too much filler in and that just turned me off. There are also lots of misinformation as to how things work out. For example:  He ambled!  Her senses hummed.  Women don't growl in dismay. they likely would sign or moan. Men don't glide. cattle bawl. they don't bray.  Mules and donkey bray!  And on and on.  I think the author had a good idea for a story. but she just had a first novel or juvenile attempt at this one. I got it free and I am happy at that.  Cannot recommend it.  Explicit sex is also a turn off."
10,"This drill is an absolute work horse.  Besides doing lots of hole drilling in different materials. I've used this drill to mix thinset mortar. grout. and joint compound....it just churns away and barely gets warm.  After burning up two Dewalt drills. I decided to go with Milwaukee.  The keyed chuck is the best on the market and you never need to worry about it slipping once you've secured it properly.  The drill has a lot of torque. so use the additional handle and hold on tight!  Great drill....great price!"
5,"In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality. I've never broken or worn out the capo. I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars. The spring tension remains strong after several years. which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing. The only problem I have with them. they seem to disappear when I'm not looking. I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use. Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty. it cleans easily."
3,"Plot:When Jake collapsed on her doorstep. Sera knew she finally had to confront their past. What she didn't expect was a night of hot healing loving would fix it all.Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (psychic) erotic romance.- 1166 kindle locations. 15000 words (but finishes around 1020 locations).- m/f - explicit. sufficiently frequent. loving.- Includes an excerpt from 'Believe the Magic' by Melani Blazer.Opinion:A nice novella with a strong story and plenty of sweet lovin'. Heavily relationship based. we get two *adults* coming together with maturity. intelligence. and caring as they take responsibility for past actions and move forward. Okay. Jake's Amazing Recuperative Powers would put a werewolf to shame. but I can forgive that. It isn't like I expect complete believability in my smutty romances... It's a clever. well-written novella that happily passes a cold evening in front of the fire with a glass of red (Barossa Valley. of course).-CR-"
5,"I read the reviews of the few similar options. I went with this one because reviews of the competition talked about how far back the guitars lean. Not much of that complaint here. But this definitely has that problem.My guitar is quite stable leaning back less than a third of what this stand causes. So this can't go in several out-of-the-way places I had hoped would work. Also. I was hoping to use two of these close together for a compact 2-guitar rack. However. the angle makes that very awkward.I hope to modify it to work. but I'm not super hopeful at this point. Will probably have to manufacture something to replace it.."
4,"Love seeing these cartoons in PERFECT re-mastered condition and bright colors.  Over the years. they have aired on channels including CARTOON NETWORK in washed out 16mm prints.  I would have preferred that the original titles remain. BUT at least they did put the original open to the series for each UNDERDOG episode.  All in all...a GREAT DVD set!  For this box set. CLASSIC MEDIA also re-did the covers for VOLUME 1 &amp; 2 and they are much IMPROVED!  Rick Goldschmidt  RANKIN/BASS Historian"
5,"Well built.  The adjuster end is deeply notched so it can be set for a wide range of angles in about 8 or 9 degree increments.  (10 possible positions between upright and horizontal)  Best for setting up drum mics as it would hold position better than a gooseneck. I'm using it in a vocal mic application as it pushes the mic a tad further away from the  stand to give  me a bit more room.  But there is no counter-weight here so its best used at shallow angles.  If I was playing a thicker instrument like an acoustic guitar. or if on-stage energy has you moving a lot more. I would opt for a boom stand instead."
9,"These are hands down the best kids goggles out there as they stay put on little faces.  The large coverage area also seems to give kids more security in the water and also leaves less chances of them falling off.  The material is tacky without being sticky. which is great for holding on to little kids in motion.  The many colors are also nice so that each kid can have their own color.  They aren't indestructible and the lens can scratch so a bit of care is a good idea. but as far as kids goggles go. this is a good investment to make."
2,"This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup. 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen."
9,"As a shampoo it's great. although my hair feels rubbery during the first lather after the second and a towel dry it feels really soft. If you have to shampoo regularly. every other day should be fine with this stuff.As a body wash it's great. the tingle is really noticeable...especially if you leave the lather in between your legs for too long it can get uncomfortably tingly so unless that's your thing. beware.It lasts a LOOOONG time. It's called magic because of how easily the oil lathers up. half a palm full should be enough to wash your hair and body easily.The smell is pretty strong compared to the others but I'm pretty sure it depends on the batch. the bottle I'm using now isn't overpowering but a lot of people have gotten bottles with too much peppermint"
2,"No assembly and ready to go out of box.  2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.  Unit does not have to be disassembled to empty. a convenient drain spout.After first use. waste water came out black. and an immediate elimination of pet odor in the stairway.Small size and light weight make it idea for immediate spill clean ups.Unit is built top heavy with a large handle. this balances the weight when solution is in the unit.Cord could be longer and retractable."
3,"I read this book first and then realized that this is really the 5th book in a series.  That was disappointing because I liked the story so I went back and ready the other books.  I would have liked them more if I didn't already know the outcomes.  I don't know why the author has these titled a three different series. or even two. when it is really just one series with 5 books as of now.  Read the books but go to her website first and figure out which book is first and what books are really in this series.  This isn't the first series by this author where I've had this problem."
8,"We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex. Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process. With minimal effort. you can throw a ball 15ft or so. With a good amount of effort. it will fly as far as 50ft easily. We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over. as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up. I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run."
6,"Light enough to be portable but heavy enough to be durable. I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!"
9,"This ball provides grip and feel for ball handlers and shooters with a composite cover material.  I have 2 boys that lllooovvvvee basketball and this ball is their favorite.  This ball emulates the feel of leather. that also offers the durability need for mixed surface use. It seems like they had ball handlers and shooters in mind when making this ball.  The ball has a wide channel design. suitable for indoors or outdoors use. the ball meets official NBA size and weight requirements.  Can really speak on the durablilty but for the most part. we are really impressed with this ball.  Buy it. you'll love it!"
2,"A very nice set - the only complaint I would have would be not so much a complaint but an observation that the cracker is seemingly designed for larger shells.  It is not as effective for smaller pieces unless you place them and attempt to hold them in place right in the middle of the unit where the two pads come together and actually make contact.  It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine.  The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end.  I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it."
10,"I was very disappointed with Porter Cable.  The plunge mechanism sticks. the on button is hard to lock on for router table use. the depth gauge is extremely hard to use. and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories.  Mine is sitting on a shelf.  In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router.  It is lighter. has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around.  I love my DeWalt 621.  I wish I had bought it first."
9,"I bought this only for the odometer function. I just wanted to know how far I was riding each day . I usually ride only two different routes that cannot be verified by driving my car over the same route. ( dedicated bike trails ). It is really not a bad unit for the price. I don't need something that will last for years. Once I know the distance of the routes I could just un-install it if I wanted to.. Ordered on a Wedesday A.M. and it arrived on Thurdsay P.M..It took about 10 minutes to install and off I went. Tested on a route @ Lake Perris Ca. and I was riding 12 miles( assumed it was 10 ) . So if you are looking to buy one. just do it. It is very inexpensive and will probably last a long time if you are careful with it .."
6,"This Swingline Lite Classic Cut is a standard size cutter but is light weight so you can move it around if needed. It's nice to cut coupons or whatever else you may be doing like craft projects. It is easy to move around and store if you have the room. Because it was called &#8220;lite&#8221;. I thought it would be a smaller size but it's just lighter in weight than others that I've used. It still takes up quite a bit of room.It has measurement markings and a grid on the the cutting board to help with measuring and lining up your cutting projects.There is a locking mechanism for the arm which is nice. I have another one that you can not lock the arm in place and I worry about the safety of that one.I noticed that is states it is for the occasional 10-sheet cutting project so I think this would be suited to homework. coupons. etc but may not stand up to daily use in an office or classroom."
12,"This game is great. I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced. The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on. If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda.Kid Icarus.Metroid.Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me."
6,"I remember learning. back in 1st or 2nd grade. how to make standard scotch tape in to double sided tape by just making a loop. That lesson is probably the most-used lesson from that time in my life and I still use that trick on a somewhat regular basis. Scotch Mounting Tape steps things up a couple of notches. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk. hand a couple of light pictures. and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light. inexpensive. durable and is handy to have around."
6,"I ship a lot of books and packages in re-used envelopes and packaging. In the past. I've always had to use an additional piece of paper. or a dark marker. to cover up the old address. That's not the case with Avery's shipping labels with TrueBlock technology.These amazing labels effectively cover up any existing label or writing. making it impossible to see the previous address. It might sound like a small feature. but for this shipper it's a time-saver.And. since they're the dependable Avery brand. I can simply enter the package number into my printing program and know that it will print the labels without fail. You can't go wrong."
2,"This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others. but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far. but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one. and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also. it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended."
4,"This movie sets a new standard for subsequent Jesus films. I must confess that I was disposed to 'like' the film no matter what. but having seen it. I find it truly remarkable. It was not entertaining... It is a film for reflection. Gibson captures perfectly the sentiment that the 'Christ should suffer and die' (the Gospel according to Luke). And for who? All of us. One cannot expect to appreciate this movie if all one wants is a good flick. This film challenges Christians and non-Christians alike to reflect on the sufferings of Christ.As an aside. I would not take small children to this film (in fact. the crucifixion scenes in most films are too much for small children). And I would recommend that viewers read one of the gospels. if not all of the gospels. before viewing it. As it covers the last 12 hours of Christ's life. much can be gained from a close reading of the biblical texts."
8,"We have a standard poodle with a ball fetish. She loves (and this is not a strong enough word) tennis balls or anything that can be thrown and returned. We have a large backyard but when I throw the tennis ball (without the Chuckit). she just looks at me with an exasperated. 'Really?' The Chuckit allows me to throw the ball clear across our (did I mention large?) yard. I can throw it for a long time without ever getting a sore shoulder or arm and the BEST PART is that I never have to touch a slobbery. muddy ball. Picking the ball up with the Chuckit is very easy. as long as the dog isn't attacking the ball while I'm trying to get it off the ground.This is a highly recommended product. We've had three (ours stay outside and get chewed on and bent by the kids at some point). And I will continue to buy them as others wear out."
12,"This Game is Awsome...purely...AWSOME!!!! I has an OK 1 player made but... the multiplayer is just outstanding!! This is a great party game... You just can't stop playing. Personally. DK. Fox. Kirby are my Favorites...btw...if you set the damage in multiplayer to 200%. then hit players 1-3 times using DK's ^+B spcieal move. your opponent will FLY!!! AND I MEAN FLY!!! ;) My Friends hate this move!!! :) Also Fox's \/+B Special move. you can reflect all moves and attacks!!! and Kirby can suck players abilities and fall on them with his \/+B special move like a brick!!! You have to buy this game!! It is the best ever!!"
12,"Right off the bat. before it came out. you'd probably wonder how would you ever imagine Mario in 3D. Well. here's your answer: Mario 64.There's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each (Counting 100 coin stars). with stars for rewards. Those stars help you unlock more levels.At the time. no one ever saw anything like this before. Although the graphics look fairly primitive now. they were still eye candy for most Mario fans. especially back then.Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like: With a free camera. flawless control. and extremely playable environments.Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge. (SPOILER ALERT) If you do manage to get them all. you get to visit Yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you 100 lives along with an improved triple jump move.Overall. you know what I want you to do. so do it. Buy the game"
10,"I've had this Plate Joiner for about 5 years. When I first got it. I thought it was great. It made slots that I could put biscuits in and join stuff. However. the first time I used it to make a critical joint. the major shortcoming showed up. The slots are not parallel to the base. They are a little more parallel when using the fence. but I prefer using the base indexing method.Also. as many other reviewers have noted. the chip ejection chute gets clogged very easily. making it difficult to work cleanly."
5,"I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned. but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form. but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two. but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously."
9,"This is a great hockey net for the kids to use on the street or driveway. It's very sturdy and still light enough for my 8 year old to carry it around easily. The netting. the posts. and the sticks are all great quality for this price. This has a lot of bang for the buck. I liked it so much. I thought I was ordering two more (to keep at the in-laws) but instead I accidentally ordered  Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White which has these flimsy little posts and I know it'll end up broken in no time. At least I have one solid net to rely on and two crappy ones as spares. I HIGHLY recommend getting this one over the Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set. White!!"
6,"This product works as advertised. Avery has been in the label business a long time. and knows how to specialize. They make affordable labels. The most difficult part for me in using labels made for a printer is setting up the program that has the addresses on them. Word makes this a little easier. Once this is accomplished. the labels can be put in the printer. printer settings changed to accept them. and you have printed address labels. Much quicker than doing this by hand. and they look so much better!"
5,"Many reviews cover the pro's of this item. so I'll be short only to add that they are very sturdy (when install properly...suggestion:  find a wall stud and use 3' screws for heavier instruments).Used in our house to hang 2 acoustic guitars and 2 Strat's.  Haven't had an issue with any in the 4-5 months we've had them up.  On the electrics. we use the section of the bracket between the wall and the hook to hang the coiled guitar cable.The hooks are bendable and can adjust or adapt to virtually any style head and are grippy enough to keep slick finishes from slipping.Wonderful simple product that makes displaying or storing your instruments stress free."
12,"This is it! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay. I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old!(yes. it is OLD now!) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made(Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox. Playstsion 2. or Xbox 360) then look for Super Mario 64. You will not be dissapointed. Guaranteed!"
4,"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED. rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school. they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed. and didn't focus on the whipping. blood. guts. nails etc. But nowadays 'religiosity' passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging 'to' a big organization. rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."
10,"This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm surprised Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws.  I was able to install it by myself. and I'm an old guy.  I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw. disconnected the bolt. and lowered it to the floor.  After that. the installation goes very easy and straightforward.  Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off. but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good.  Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw.  I recommend this accessory."
8,"Not the &#34;Ohhhhhh noooooooo!&#34; again! This toy gets to be very annoying because that's all it says but it's fun to see the look on the dog's face when Mr. Bill says it. This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog doesn't use the soft mouth. The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone. It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to. you just sew it back up. It's a fun toy but easy to break. This was the 3rd toy I've bought for the dog. She likes the &#34;Ohhhh noooo!!!&#34;"

Jonas Mendez is the town's sheriff.The last time Deidre and Jonas saw each other was to say goodbyebefore Deidre left for New York ten years ago.Ten years is a long time. but the attraction that simmered betweenDeidre and Jonas is as strong as ever and the anticipation of whatmight become of it is even stronger!Anticipation is the perfect title for Jonas and Deidre's story.

There is a lot of heat and heart in Anticipation;it's a sexy and very romantic story.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"
9,"Out of the box you will be impressed with this great multitool! Beautifully polished. individual locking tools that don't clump when you open them. That pliers are not needle nose but I like the compromise. The stout but slightly rounded nose is precise enough for most precision jobs but because the metal is of softer material I can understand why they don't included it. The craftsmanship on this tool is top notch and better than any other multitool I ever had. What more can I say. it's a victorinox!"
5,"I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them."
9,"This is the only soap I use (with occasional excursions into pine tar soap. for specific uses... See my reviews on pine tar soap)I love the peppermint especially for the tingle and zing you get from using it!I use it as bodywash. shampoo. and to do dishes with.I've never experienced the drying effects when others complain of when using it on my hair either.Don't know if it's due to others not using it right or freak body chemistry on my part. Either way. I am a proud Dr. Bronners user!"
12,"In my opinion. this is the greatest Playstation game ever released. The storyline is intense. and profusely in-depth and really grasps you into the storyline. which revolves around many characters instead of one. The music is beautiful and many times envokes emotions during parts of the game. this game . in my opinion. has the greatest musical score. I have noticed people complain about this games graphics. well if you have a problem with graphics in an RPG...then I have to say. your intellectual level is very low. First of all. this game's graphics are fine.even compared to the graphics of more recent video game titles...and the game does Not revolve around its graphics.There are many other factors that seperate this game from other RPGs. This game also has the best story in a video game title to date. and there are situations that occur during the game that add to the story perfectly. If you want a solid. and deep RPG. this is for you."
6,"This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. I am always looking for a way to cut my scrapbook papers which are 12&#34;x12&#34;.  This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed.  The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. It is easy to handle and you won't hurt your back when you pick it up. The handle comes with an extension which is removable for storage.  The blade is very. very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. It also has a grid and scale for measurements and a guard rail for safety. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses"
8,"This product isn't quite as high quality as it looks in the picture above. and I'd highly recommend you take a close look at its dimensions before purchasing it (if this is a 'medium.' I can't imagine how tiny the 'small' must be).  I'd also only recommend this item for supervised play (not. as I'd hoped. as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy's crate overnight).  The body of the toy is only the length of my index finger. and I'm concerned that any larger breed puppy will rip this thing to shreds in minutes if you let him.  Oh well."
5,"These little patch cables work nicely. there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches. right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches. right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches. whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude. would I recommend these? Yes. if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable. go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else."
8,"My cats loved this. They had energy. their coats looked shiny and had less dander. Compared to Blue Buffalo. this is better and less expensive. But it is still quite pricey so I switched to Purina Friskies which is garbage. because I had to save some money this month. I did some research and the Purina One formula looks pretty good. I would say it is between the Friskies and the Beyond. The first ingredient is real meat. I looked up what 'corn gluten meal' is in the regular Purina One (not Beyond) it is a decent/inexpensive source of protein. It isn't actual gluten at all. it is the second ingredient on the list. I am going to try the Purina One next. And if there are coupons for this one I will get this one. It is really good. I would recommend. especially over Blue Buffalo and Wellness. in my humble opinion."
6,"Avery is a brand that has been doing laser labels for as long as I can remember and they put out a very nice product.  This particular size. the 5260 is the perfect size for address labels for envelopes.  Three columns. ten long means you get 30 labels to a sheet.Easy peel off. easy printing with no jams.  The perfect label.The nice thing about Avery is that it works seamlessly with Microsoft Office.  In word they have templates for all the Avery laser labels and you just have to select which one you are using and the blank template just pops up.  Sometimes with generic brands. this is not the case and you have to manually set your parameters which while doable for a regular MS Word user could prove to be quite an obstacle for the casual user.I highly recommend these labels to anyone.  They will not give you trouble."
3,"What I Loved: Scott was such a delicious guy to read!  He was just the right amount of alpha vs vulnerable.  He was also YUMMY!  The fact that he was blind kind of made him that much more lovable.  Tara and Scott had a great chemistry that was fun to read.Complaint: The ending was way to abrupt!  It felt like a whole chapter was left out of the bookWhat makes this good Holiday read:  If you are looking for a short but naughty holiday read this may work for you.  It was about getting out of a bad situation into a good situation.  Just keep in mind the rather abrupt ending."
3,"I enjoyed the book and the characters I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because I too feel that the author could have backed off a little with all the erotica. The story line is a good one but needs to be developed more. Some reviews were complaining about the link between rider. dragon and sex. If anyone who has read the' Dragonriders of Pern' series would know this has already been established in Dragon fantasy lore. However where as the Pern series down plays the sexual side of the relationships Maiden Flight is in your face erotica. I do agree there needs to be a warning that this is an ADULT dragon fantasy novel  and not for young adults.  The series has great promise and I'm hoping that the next book goes more into the story line with a little sex thrown it ;)"
4,"The late Robert Ginty. R.I.P.. lays down some rough road in this one. though the guy on the cover aint him! This is a NY picture. like Street Trash. Ms. .45. The Wanderers. The Warriors. The Lords Of Flatbush. The taking Of Pelham 1.2.3. (the original 70s version with Walter Matthau. Robert Shaw. and Simon Oakland. not the unneccessary '00s remake!). et al. And like all good made-in-New York movies. you know eventually somebody's gonna be handed their ass!! This is no exception. Be prepared to suffer. You have been warned! The sickness with the quickness!!"
10,"1/8/10 Have been using this drill and am very pleased.  It has tons of torque and the handle comes in handy.  Just great to have a corded drill with this type of power for when the cordless 18V wont do the job or if you have a lot of screws to driveHavent used this drill yet but am looking forward to putting it to work.  I bought it because I only had cordless drills. aside from a great. rugged Milwaukee Hammer drill. was also confident because of great reviews from others. It is very solid and I like the quick change cord.  I expect to have this drill for years"
3,"This is the first book I've read by Ally Blue and it won't be the last. I enjoyed this story immensely even if it was on the light side. There was little to no background or buildup. but somehow it worked as a short story about two very sweet people. I like the heroes this author created. they were good and kind people. even though there were some fights and arguments. they worked things out. I was not a fan of the whole developer and corrupt city officials part of the story but luckily for me. that was only a brief part of the whole story. I enjoyed this very much and would recommend it to others as a hot. romantic MM read."
9,"I bought the blue/heavy resistance band to use in two of my tube workouts. The band I had no longer provided enough resistance and it was time to upgrade.Two things to point out. The handles are not padded. Not a big deal.Secondly. this tube is about 6 inches shorter than what I was previously using. The measurements are in the description. I thought the bands were a standard length so I didn't pay attention to the length. In order to use this band in my workouts. I need to reposition my body/grip/whatever during some of the exercises due to the shorter length.The band is still a nice upgrade from what previously used. Just look at measurements if the band is going to be used as a replacement band."
12,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly.  What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight.  This feature made for great fighting fun. but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities. that feature had to be omitted.  It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses. and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature. the graphics are painfully watered down. the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates. and there is loads of slowdown.  If you can get past all that. this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan. but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
3,"I have been reading all of Delle Jacobs' books this month. and this is one of my favorites. I recognize I really like her more comical plots than the more serious ones. and part of the allure is her wonderful wit and wonderful characterizations. But this is also a truly very sweet love story as well. and very beautifully told. Not a dull moment in the entire book. Some explicit sex. but some of it is even....funny. Yes. funny!This is one I will definitely re-read and pass along to friends. I highly recommend it!"
10,"The main flaw with this light would have been trivial in the recent past. Compared to other ways of providing light. even DeWalt ways. this is not an effective solution.I bought this to have a working light that also used the 18v power packs from my various DeWalt 18v tools. So far so good. But it really burns some power. it gets quite warm and the light doesn't last as long and isn't as bright as you would hope.I also have the DeWalt DC527 fluorescent light. it provides a much better working light. lasts longer and is easier to use to get light on your work. By comparison to the DC527 this is an uneven and yellowish light.This is more compact than the DC527 though. and it provides better range. fluorescent provides more white light. but only at limited range."
5,"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard. which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound. drums. congas. tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech. the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best."
10,"Almost bought the variable speed but less powerful cousin.  Glad I didn't.  This unit works great.  It's heavy so you won't want to do much vertical or overhead work.  One reviewr commented that it wears out his workers and I can see why.  An hour is the must I can go without a break. But you can get a lot of sanding done in an hr with this tool.Much quieter than my old Sears unit.  Dust collector works surprisingly well (but I wish they offered a vac attachment becasue at the rate this unit removes material you will have to empty bag every 10 min or sooner.Probably 3 times faster than my 3' Sears and more stable with 4' footprint.My past tools have been Bosch. Milwaukee. and Dewalt.  But I bought Makita's top of line 18V saw and drill and was very impressed.  Bought this based on that experience and great reviews.  Very satisfied."
4,"Wonderful .program. heartwarming story. and the sh?^[EST PRESENTATION YET..  This dvd is not restored...one...sengle.bit.  It is the same dark. muddled. dirty. bespeckled and trimmed copy we've seen on tv . video. and dvd. for what?  forty years?  I was taken in. amazed and ecstatic that my favorite holiday special would now look as wonderful as it deserved to.  I'm tempted to take it back. but at least it's on a stand-alone dvd. instead of added as an afterthought to some Rankin-Bass collection of more &#34;famous&#34; specials."
10,"I bought this saw at a woodworking show a couple years ago and have been thrilled with its performance ever since.  I previously owned an inexpensive Black and Decker which had poor balance. a top handle. and tended to vibrate terribly.  I have also used DeWalt and Milwaukee jigsaws. and I still maintain that Bosch is the best.  I happen to prefer the barrel grip.  With this saw I can make super smooth. nearly tear-out free cuts in almost any material as long as I use the proper blade and blade speed.  The sheer lack of vibration alone makes this saw worth its weight in gold when you are trying to make an intricate cut in thin material!!!  I highly recommend this product."
6,"The 3m Copy Holder is useful in a variety of ways. It's good for the student who needs to type up his or her notes from classes. Or the office worker who needs a place to hold papers. The copy holder is 18' wide and is sturdy enough to hold up to 300 sheets of thick paper. catalogs. books. and more. The copy hold fits perfectly on most desks or tables and is designed to be positioned directly between your computer monitor and keyboard. however it will easily fit anywhere. It also has an elastic cord that stretches across to hold your documents in place.  Overall this a very handy office tool and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs it."
2,"Purchased the 3670G via Amazon. Just arrived and immediately plugged it into my Kill-A-Watt. The device shows amperage draw on anything plugged into it and it shows the Mite is only drawing 10amps.Either I received the 10amp model that other reviewers have posted about (old reviews though... two year old reviews) or the mfg is lying about it's capabilities.Having said all that. it's a nice. simple. lightweight machine that really sucks (in a good way). but I can't help but wonder how much better it would perform if it was truly the 12amp model.If any other reviewers have any advice. please post a comment."
9,"The Seal Pup is a great knife to have alongside your pistol. This rode next to my M9 on a Blackhawk Serpa and Omega holster. Held its edge. the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy. The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap. Chunks got torn out of it. The blade finish also wears off. I ended up engraving mine a bit so it didn't look like everyone else's knife. Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally. I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one. Great buy and if you don't have a need for an M9 bayonet. this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments."
12,"I believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because. the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games. Seek out enemy. kill and move to the next level. and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others. Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles. so that adds to the fun. I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters. locations. car. weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line. Yes the graphics are not all out there however. the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning. If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one. I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all. And this one I really do like very much."
3,"I do agree that I would like to have spent more time with these characters. I was very bummed when it just ended. and i do agree it could have used more depth. But I really loved these characters. For what they were. in the length given. they popped. Book reads very much like a brilliant fantasy. Like all her stories so far. the story has a sweet quality to it. but very hot. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was and look forward to more from this author."
4,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon. yet one rarely falls into the  category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality.  Anybody  interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at  least a hint of his comic genius. therefore I will not expound on this  subject.This DVD is. beyond a doubt. the most comprehensive compendium  of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format. and it is all in one  show.  You get everything. as mentioned in the description up top and many  other reviews.  As a primer to Andy. this disc is well worth buying.  As an  adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan. this DVD fits in  perfectly with your collection."
3,"The Cedar Cove Series is written so anyone any age can enjoy the story.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest I could relate to many of the area references.  The story held my interest because there are so many stories going on at the same time.  Unfortunately the TV rendition changed a few of the events and personalities of the characters and that to me detracted from the book rendition.  I read all 6 books and enjoyed picking up the story each and every time I left off and resumed the books.  Good writing and story telling."
4,"This is a great movie that sets the classic tale of A Christmas Carol in a very American setting.  Set in the time of the Great Depression the character of Scrooge played by Henry Winkler is perfect for this. The heartwarming change of his character. although well known by most. is given such a unique spin that this should become a classic in its own right. The attention to detail by the costuming and sets are wonderful and the makeup staff did an amazing job at aging the young Henry Winkler. You will not regret watching this new twist on the classic tale."
9,"I was bored and trolling Amazon and saw this...it looked like fun so I ordered it. I read the assembly directions. which said you need 3 people. but a woman said in her review that she assembled her trampoline alone...props to her cause I tried and nothing...absolutely no movement whatsoever. I took it to work and 3 guys assembled it very easily. but used their combined strength to make the pieces go together and open. The smell is obnoxious. which I hope will dissipate over time. All in all a fun purchase."
4,"This film was a bad film based soley on entertainment value.  I don't see the necessity in a gore fest where Jesus Christ is involved.  If there were any FIRST hand accounts of this brutality.  this film may have more substance.  Seems that Gibson has his own spirituality on his sleeve.  I don't think that creates art or has any entertainment value.  Certainly blood and unrelenting violence is NOT entertaining.  Nor does this film have ANY artistic value.  The dialect isn't presented well here either.  The Aramaic voice isn't given justice here.  given the horridly poor interpretation and it's presentation.  This film is trash.  Simply.  God bless."
12,"What can I possibly say about this game that hasn't been said a million times.Perfection.Groundbreaking.Beautiful.Just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Zelda 64.Zelda was my introduction to RPG's and what an introduction it was.The good.Everything.Graphics. story. pacing. etc...Insanely difficult in parts. I still can't beat the water temple without the walk through.And Ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time.The bad?Nothing.One of the games that not only defined the N64 but a game that set the standard for excellence in RPG's.One of the best...ever.Highest recommendations."
7,"It is nicely constructed. It is made of metal. so it will hold up. The perch is weight triggered so larger animals like squirrels will lower the perch and block the food. You can also adjust it dependent on the size of the birds in the area. You can adjust it for larger or smaller birds. It is larger than I expected and will hold plenty of food. If you twist the Weathervane. it will unlock the the panel on the top for easy access for refilling. It also comes with an attachment (including fasteners) that you can place on a stand and you can place the feeder on the stand. easy to place and remove from stand. Over all this is a nice feeder."
12,"The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game. The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2. tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation."
2,"OXO Soft-Handled Can Opener. Item # 28081. This is a hard-to-clean kitchen tool. Not all the metal parts are stainless so they get pitted and retain food particles. Also. the soft handles are not sealed onto the body of the can opener. so dishwater accumulates in them. and therefore so do rotting food particles. mold... you get the point. It is possible to pull off the handles and wash all the surfaces. but what a pain! And then. the handles wear and loosen so they start to slide when opening cans. After three months. I replaced the Oxo Good Grips Can Opener with aZyliss Lock-n-Lift Can Openerwhich. after six months. still works very well."
4,"I loved it-I had seen this movie many years ago and loved it then&#62; I love Richard Burton-He's so deep in this movie-very young and very deep. What a brillant actor he is and became.I gave it five stars because the quality of him overall deserved it.Olvia De Havilland-wow what a brillant star she is. Between the two of them-wow! how different they are-but this movie brought a side we never saw before.Thank you -for the opportunity to share my views."
7,"There were forest fires around us last summer and I had a couple of these around.  I set them up to water out in the fields around us.  They worked so well that I bought 6 more just for this purpose.  As I am driving around my area; I see that I am not the only one who uses them.  They are sturdy. don't leak for the most part and the sprinkler head is of decent quality.  Unlike some other tripods. the sprinkler can be replaced with another if needed.  They will fall over if you have a decent windy day.  So. you should check on them occasionally."
5,"I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar. so after some research online and talking to friends. I bought this capo.It goes on easily.comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside. seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!"
3,"Overall. I was absorbed in this story and the semi-abrupt ending has really left me for wanting more.  Don't get me wrong on the ending though.  It was abrupt only in the fact that I wanted to know more and there wasn't any.  I've already checked out Kaye's site and the only other novel listed is Angelic Avenger. which I don't believe is in this series.  I'm 99.9% sure of that one.  So. I'm going to be hoping there's more to this story in the future because I really want to know.  Definitely a great read for anyone looking for something new.For my full review. check out Literary Escapism."
8,"We've been giving our dog this medicine for years and its always done a good job of keeping the ticks and other things off of him.  We have found a few dead ticks in his fur. but never a live one and certainly not one head deep into his blood supply.  Applying it isn't so difficult but since our dog is white. it does leave a discoloration in his fur until his next bath.  This is what our vet recommended so we're going with it and it works fine."
12,"I always hated the WCW. I was playing Warzone. Attitude and WWF titles for a long time. Then I somehow ended up owning this game and I inteneded to dissmiss it. but I found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it. I was happy to hear THQ got the rights to WWF and went from this to Wrestlmania and then the best game on the 64 NO MERCY. However. this is the foundation of where it started and I respect it for that. It brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights. I recomend No Mercy over this. but this original version deserves your respect."
7,"I haven't used lighter fluid in years. ever since getting one of these.I didn't believe that just a couple sheets of newspaper would be enough to get the charcoal going. but that's really all you need.  I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know. real wood. not gravel and clay briquettes). and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire. and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature. so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle. and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals. so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."
2,"I just received this yesterday. and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.  I was a little apprehensive. since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.  My first batch worked flawlessly!  The machine was quiet. operated smoothly. and it was soooo simple!  I am going to buy an extra freezing cannister so we can do two batches back-to-back.  We've been using our old electric rock salt machine. but now we'll probably get rid of it.  Also. due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker. we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.  I recommend it."
7,"I have really come to love the Fiskars tools.  I bought a post hole digger which is head and shoulders better than everything else. and this hatchet is the same way.  It is different than others in many ways.  It looks different and honestly a bit fragile. However it is one tough mother.  The lightweight handle gives you more head speed. which translates into deeper cuts per chop.  The angle of the blade and the non-stick coating really slices through wood.  The way the blade is attached provides no place for the head to bind up in the wood which again allows you to cut deeper.  I am buying one of the axes in this line too.  Awesome tool."
4,"I found the first half of the film to be very interesting and well done. Fine acting and production values.  Then it turned into an S&M porno movie.  The whippings with both the canes and the metal tipped whips caused me to fast forward through most of that scene.  It was gratuitous and I could just see the S&M set buying this dvd just to pleasure themselves while watching it. The other thing that bothered me throughout was the fact that the score from Jesus Christ Superstar kept running through my head as I watched it. I would give the movie around 4-5 stars if the quality of the story telling had lived up the the first half for the entire film."
9,"The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions. I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED.  I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing.  Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating.  The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating.  For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.  For more advanced boxers. spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight.  Wraps are not flexible and too short.  Bag gloves are unnecessary."
9,"I put this on my Ruger Mark III Target and I am very happy. The multiple reticles would be more fun with larger targets. but at 50 yards. you only need the 3 MOA dot. Easy zeroing and not as heavy as expected. but then again. a Mark III Target is a beast of a .22 pistol. Don't buy the cheesy $20 red dot. Save your dough and buy this quality product. Aimpoints are GREAT. but over rated. If you don't mind the added weight. then this is a better buy."
2,"I've been using Pressure Cookers for years. and was under the assumption that 'size does matter'...  Well. guess what? It DOES!After adapting and adjusting because my pressure cookers were just too big to do the small batch things. I figured I'd give one of these little babies a try.It's amazing just how often I use this little guy. It's quality and performance is wonderful!!  I've used this little pressure cooker more in the last two months than I use my big one in a year. Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them. but this one gets used regularly. It's definitely gathering no dust..;~)Excellent Purchase!!!"
2,"I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.  In truth. I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.  To that end. it's been perfect.  It's a powerful fan. so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.  Note that this is not a small fan.  It's just shy of 2' tall. so while the handle on top makes it portable. and it's built to stand on the floor. it's not made for a tiny bedroom.  The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room. I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.  I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual."
2,"This book is absolutely beautiful. A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations. Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color. .... is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland. ...The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly. As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears. Each page mentions the color twice and an animal. The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old. The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies. A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again. I sometimes even read it to myself. The purple page is MY favorite."
7,"I placed seeds into a miracle grow potting mix. watered. then covered up the dome and in 3 days every one of the 12 species had sprouted to about an inch tall (or more in the case of fast growing sunflowers).Echinacea. red lettuce. romaine lettuce. snap peas. orange sunflower. red sunflower. chives. 4 different heirloom tomatoes. and dill - all of them are growing like weeds.  As soon as they're big enough for transplanting. I'll be using it again to sprout another 12 or so species for the spring garden.The moisture level is pretty constant after te first and only watering 10 days ago. since you can keep the dome mostly shut (or open it up if that's too wet).My only complaint is that the dome dribbles water when you move it since the set is designed with the clear plastic dome on top/over the edge.  But. that was nothing a tea towel under the seed bed doesn't fix.  For the price. I really couldn't be happier!"
8,"This quality spray did exactly as advertised. I have a cat. who likes to go outside his litter box. and an active toddler who loves to drop food and color on our light-colored carpet.  I used this Bissell Pet Stain and Odor spray as directed. generously spraying a stained area. blotting and covering with a wet rag. and leaving it alone for several hours.  I am pleased to say that even some long-time stains that I grown to live with are starting to fade considerably or disappear entirely.As another reviewer pointed out. this product does not work on ink. My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen. and this spray was not very effective on that area. However. as promised. it did eliminate virtually all of my cat stains throughout the house. I have no complaints and would easily recommend this to others."
10,"I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job. but in retrospect it's not worth the cost. I recently found the Makita 7.5' sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs.  Buy the Makita  if you must have a lightweight saw. Also. the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign. It's just way too sloppy to stay at zero. Mine has a little play which is annoying. Zero means Zero (90^deg)!!! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it. like the Dewalt. While the 8.5' may be the 'original' slider. you will be better served with a 10' that bevels left and right...."
7,"I have had this cover on my grill for over a year now in Minnesota. where it has endured a wide range of harsh weather.  The cover has held up wonderfully.  The only word of caution is on the color.  It is clearly shown in the listing as having green left and right panels.  They may be green when you first buy the cover. but they will quickly turn to brown when you put it on your grill.  To me. this is a minor drawback. but others might find it more objectionable."
2,"Then go with the Ninja Master Prep. I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush. When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant. so I pulsed a littlemore and it turned it to mush. On the New Ninja Master Prep. It has only pulse one speed. but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades. two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done. I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly. Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a muchbetter unit."
10,"talk about getting down to business.  this saw chews up wood.nails.pipe. whatever gets in the way.  it definately outcuts the milwaukee.  i like the weight of this tool. it makes those overhead cuts alot easier. just rest the saw on top and let it chew its way through.i deducted a star for two reasons: 1: there is more vibration than the milwaukee(what else do you compare a saws all to).2: the quick change chuck is a little difficult at times.  it likes to bind up and you will need a plier to twist it free.  not a real tight bind. just too much for fingers.overall. if mine was lost. stolen. or broken. i would not hesitate to purchase the P-C again"
7,"It's a classic all right. but a clever classic.  This mower is a straight forward push reel mower with a few nice touches.  That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well. you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag. far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing. however. is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut."
4,"I would have liked to seen more to this movie other than just the beating. I also hate subtitles. I don't care if they were trying to make it accurate to the dialect. I don't like to go to a movie to pay to read. to me it defeats the purpose: i could read a book. Had lots of gore. for that I gave it an extra star. For the repetitive scenes over and over again. I subtracted several stars. You know what kills me. Conservatives and religious people bash violence in movies and video games. but it seems as if it is ok to put this stuff in as long as your talking about Christ. Hypocrisy = religion do as I say not as I do. right? and stay away from those alter boys!"
4,"I really didn't like the way Jesus is portrayed in this film because it shows Him more as being a human being who plays practical jokes on His Apostles and goofing off during His sermons than being the Son of God who came on earth to save us. Call me old fashioned. but I like the traditional way of portraying the life of Jesus in film. which shows Him as being compassionate. loving. and bold in doing His mission. and yes with a sense of humor. but at the same time taking serious things seriously. I have to say that I liked the Jesus of Nazareth film and 'The Passion' by Mel Gibson. much better."
8,"We got Frontline for our Husky/Shepard mix in the fall.  It worked well. and killed off a few fleas she had picked up.  All through the Mississippi winter and early spring she was fine. not a single flea.  However. come late spring. the stuff totally failed.  Not only was she covered in fleas. but so were our cats and furniture!  After finally getting rid of the fleas. we switched to K9 Advantix.  That seems to be keeping up with the challenge.  I guess it works better for light duty. but it couldn't keep up with prime flea season. which is sort of the whole point.  I have heard it's easy to get a bad batch though. maybe that's just what happened."
10,"PC 97366 has so much vibrations that I had to give it gift to my enemy..  Horrible...  then within a week . I got a Xmas Gift of Home Depot Card and I used it to buy Rigit Sander from Home Depot for $139...  ( I SAID . I CAN RETURN IT IF I DON'T LIKE IT )WHAT A SURPIRISE THEN...  THE RIGID IS SUPREME SANDER WITH ZERO PAIN IN HAND AND AWESOME GERMAN BUILT ...  GREAT BUILD QUALITY AND 3 YEAR WARRANTY...  YOU CAN'T MISS THAT...I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD RIGID SANDERS ARE...  BYE PORTER CABLE..."
7,"Fiskars 7977 Composite Cultivator is certainly not as strong as a similar cultivator made of metal. but it's stronger than you might expect. and is a tool that is well-suited for light duty gardening.  Made out of a very stiff composite plastic called `FiberComp'. tool is very lightweight.  The handle is rock solid. and while much thinner. the tines are surprisingly hard as well.  While this tool is most useful in soil that contains some moisture and is somewhat soft. it is capable of more rugged performance.  The handle has a spot on the top for your thumb. and a slot at the end for hanging.This tool will not corrode. and if used properly and not abused. it should last for some time.  The price at Amazon is a little steep. so may want to check your local hardware store for a better deal."
7,"I purchased this to brew my batches of beer outside during the summer months (it gets too hot inside having a pot boil for so long..and my wife doesn't like the smell either). I was very pleased at the quality of construction and the ease of using this. After setting it up and testing for leaks using soapy water...I was ready to go.  As others have mentioned. the paint does burn off many places during its first use. I didn't buy this to look pretty...I want it to brew beer...and fast. And fast brewing it certainly does. After using it a few times. I feel more comfortable cranking it up to high. Definitely watch out as boil overs are much easier than on an inside burner. Overall though. I would estimate almost half an hour is saved by using this burner vs. the stove (I do partial mashes only). Good investment for any home brewer...and it can double as burner for frying turkeys!"
8,"Bought this for my 2-year-old lab as she is a chewer.  She sniffed it and walked away.  I left it in her toy box and she picked it up once but only to move it out of the way to get at something else.  I don't think it has a smell that entices dogs to chew it as my 9-month-old. also a big chewer. hasn't touched it either.  I'm sure there are other dogs who love this but it was a waste of money for me."
8,"We have two lab mixes. The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew. but he was going through too many rawhides. I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section. The first plain bone went over well. So I ordered more on Amazon. I'm so glad I did! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have! Thank goodness for nylabones!"
5,"I've been a gigging musician for almost 20 years. and this is the most well made. most comfortable guitar/bass strap I've ever used.Pros:- Substantial padding where you need it- Perfect stitching- Heavy. stiff leather ends- Soft. fine-woven material - not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps- Underside is lined with an even softer material - makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on- Did I mention it's super comfortable?Cons:- None to speak of.  Seriously.  It's that phenomenal.Perfect whether you're rocking a featherweight Strat or a 16-pound 6-string bass.I use it with a 13-pound 5-string Warwick bass. and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me.  I hardly notice I'm actually wearing it.Combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks. and it could easily last you 10 years.You will not be sorry with this purchase."
12,"I won't lie this game was really cool back in the day and i play it with utter pleasure.(at that time) it was only my second 64 game i ever borrowed. sure the graphics was stink and at times the game play frustrating the heck out of me. however this isn't one i'll call a classic it's no Zelda. Perfect Dark . Donkey Kong 64 and i can go on and on. if you don't believe me try to play this game now!!!! you will find yourself saying yuk! yuk! yuk! 'n' i am being nice. it's worth a try but most likely true gamers will find it bogus. it has not true replay value and all in all it had it's time and that's all it will ever have. in my opinion. for those who loved it i am no psychologist so i can't say whats your problem is but!!! maybe you need to play real good game laterzzzzz folks / gamers."
12,"In its tenure. the N64 had its share of bad games. With exceptions like Super Mario 64. the THQ wrestling games and a few others. it seemed like the bad outweighed the good. But with 'Ocarina of Time'. the balance took a drastic shift as n64 was given its best overall game.'Ocarina of TIme' has many strong points for itself. For one. the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake. The game plays across a vast world with different subsections. each with their own particular themes. The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game. Graphics and sounds are done extremely well. considering the cartridge space allowed.There is not much to complain about. as this game really showed players what the N64 was capable of. It's unfortunate that other game publishers didn't work this hard. But then again. &quot;Ocarina&quot; is a tough act to follow."
4,"This is another excellent addition to TNT's Bible collection. It tells the story of Joseph. the son who rose from a slave to the Viceroy of Egypt.Joseph is the favored son of his father. a fact which causes no small amount of jealousy from his other brothers. It eventually causes so much resentment that they sell him as a slave to a passing caravan and tell his father that he was killed. In slavery. he is taken to Egypt. His intelligence and honest are both a curse to him and a blessing. Through God's favor. and Joseph's steadfastness. he rises to a position of immense power. When his brothers come to him. seeking help. they do not recognize him and the stage is set for either reconciliation or terrible retribution.The story is well done and is in keeping with the scriptures. At first. it can be a bit confusing because it relies on flashbacks that are not always immediately apparent but this is soon gotten over. The result is a good story done well."
5,"The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price. It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a.young (smaller) player or a.nice travel instrument."
2,"My son works at a ice cream shop. and when I recieved this ice cream scoop. he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work. Until he actually used it. It looks metal. but feels like it's plastic. When I used it for the first time. I was scooping out very hard ice cream. and it felt like it was going to break. I had to turn it in circles to get anything. I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one. At least I know it won't break in my hand."
5,"this is my first petal of  any kind.  I had read that the Wah shoud be your first so I went with that.  glad I did.  this Wah petal is so much fun.  you can make as many cool sounds as your imagination will allow.  It is hours and hours of fun.  the sounds are great.  I have had no problem with performance.  it works as it should.  I highly recommend this petal.  it's price is attractive as well."
8,"I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years.  NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid.  This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years. but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off.  The cord finally snapped on Monday.  Not only the short lifespan considering the price. but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan.  No matter what litter brand I tried. it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan. would stick to the rake. and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws. which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea. very poor longterm performance."
10,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop. I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever. but it works well."
3,"Oh this was a yummy. naughty book! I'm just disappointed it was so short!  I can only imagine how great it could have been had the author taken/been given the time to write more depth to the story.  The speed (due to the short nature of the story) was hard to believe. even given their history. but it was still a great read.Very short. about 20 minutes to read. but it was still hot!  Maybe not worth $3 because it was about as short as the ones you can find free on Elloras website but still one that i will be keeping for another day!"
5,"Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less. It was made for the military. The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high. It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better. I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it.It is just very wasteful for the cost. I have had good luck with wd40 too. but it is very flammable. I would call it average."
2,"I bought this only to make apple sauce. Growing up. my mother had one (for 25+ years) that all of us kids would use and this is nothing like the one we used to use. I have used it 6-8 times and have found the following:- I can only fit a very small bowl underneath it.- The legs slide all over the place easily. I have to grip the handle VERY firmly in order to prevent this from sliding all over the counter top.- The wooden pestle is already all dinged up and even has a chip in it.- The inside of the press is all scraped and dinged upIt does work fine. but the craftsmanship is very low. VERY thin metal. and I don't expect this to last more than 2 seasons of making apple sauce. If I had to do it all over again I would not purchase this item."
3,"This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish.  I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it.  The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots.  I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville.  Now that I caught up on the background. I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends.  Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities.  I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every"
7,"This is a nice. versatile pot holder for any sort of railing.  We live in a townhouse. and each unit has a fenced-in. concrete patio.  There's really no place to plant flowers. so a container garden is an only option.  I didn't want many containers crowding the ground of my small patio. so I opted for hanging them places.This pot holder is exactly what I needed.  It's 10 inches at the top. and will accommodate a range of flower pots.  The fastener is adjustable. to make them useful in a wide variety of locations.  I was able to fit it to our fencing perfectly.  It's sturdy and well-made. and I expect it will last through many cycles of flowers."
10,"This scroll saw is as advertised.  I had a lesser model that I started out on and it had a lot of vibration.  Intricate patterns were difficult to cut since the vibration would break the tiny pieces of wood.  There is NO vibration with this saw.  It is solid on its base and everything has easy access.  One item that I added was the &#34;Lifter&#34;. which I purchased separately.  It holds the arm up when changing blades or rethreading.  Dewalt should consider adding this item to the saw - it works great."
9,"Works great on firearms with a fixed trigger guard.However. on my two lever-action rifles. it's not very effective -- probably no surprise. given the design. On an older Winchester 94. I can get position it to lock the trigger guard and trigger together. with some effort. On a Winchester 9422. it attaches itself to the trigger guard. and it just slides off of the trigger itself when the lever is used. The rifle can be loaded. cocked. and fired with the lock still in place."
12,"Sephiroth. the main villian of the game. is probably the best-dressed villian in a FF game.  Also. he has the most sinister theme of any villian in any game.  Everything about Sephiroth is sinister.You play Cloud. a man from the small city of Nibelheim (sounds like a city in Germany). Cloud works for AVALANCHE. a terrorist group that's fighting against the evil Shirna. Inc.  As the game unfolds. you learn that Shirna. Inc does far more evil than AVALANCHE does.  Shirna. Inc knows no end to its evil.One of the best games for the ps1!"
10,"I bought this unit some time ago and finally got to use it remodeling our basement. I have a 12inch compound sliding miter saw in my garage but the thought of lugging that thing down stairs to cut base moulding didnt float my boat. Then. I remembered my Bosch 1640SVK. Yes. it has limitations but none that was a deal breaker. I placed a 3/4 sheet of 24x96 plywood on a couple of saw horses and I was trimming and nailing like a Pro. No clouds of saw dust. no dust vacuum running although SVK does have a 2.25 port. I can sight exactly where I want the narrow kerf and it does the job.I will have this fine tool outside when I re-do the screens on our three season porch.Thanks Again Bosch!!!"
7,"I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons. but with the help of another person and two long poles. we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away. it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled. before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing. what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit. but I don't want to kill songbirds. certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away. not kill them."
5,"Do as the manual says. lube them up every so often. and these will work like a charm. I got these after an unfortunate incident with my strap slipping off of the strap button. and taking a chip out of the binding. The black ones work well with most finishes. and it works with most straps. as long as the ends aren't ridiculously thick. Inside of the box. it came with 2 screw sizes. One thing to note however is that these make the strap protrude much farther out of the guitar than normal. No biggie however. as most straps are adjustable. so just adjust for the change in strap position. and you're golden!"
7,"I picked this feeder because I wasn't sure any birds would find my feeder. and I don't have a ton of disposable income.I'm happy to say that a squirrel family has adopted the feeder as its own personal buffet. It's my fault. I hung it too close to the house. but it's all I've got. really. So I watch the squirrels. who eat a LOT of food. But! Today I saw actual birds happily chirping and snacking at it!The feeder is plastic. so I imagine it'll scratch/fade/oxidize over time. Seed spills out the holes at the perches when I'm filling it. which is a drag. But that's me being picky. For the price. it's a terrific feeder!"
4,"The special features on this newest digitally remastered dvd are not listed on Amazon or the box. For those interested you get the Fame and Fortune song as an extra. but not part of the film. There is also the Destiny's Child music video. Regis Philbin music video. a Rudolph trivia game. original tv promo. plus spanish/french language options and subtitles. Don't watch this on TV as they cut parts out for more commercials. Watch it fully uncut on dvd as it was meant to be seen! It's worth the purchase."
12,"the one that started it all i have it and you should to i will in detail say the pros and cons of the game.the pros are great story. great puzzles. the suspense is great as well as the monsters that are in it over all it draws you in the world of the resident evil.the cons to much back and forth in the game. bazooka wont blow open doors. the other issue is if played on the ps2 you have to get used to the original controls again im used to ps2 games now guess im spoiled lol where you use the analog sticks to move and look around.over all great game turn out the lights put it in and put yourself in the game and have fun."
4,"Holy cow!!!  I was completely drenched with sweat at the end of this workout.  I have a few of Kathy's videos and have always been pleased with her technique.  She doesn't disappoint here.  I have all of Billy Blanks  Tae-bo tapes and this so much better.  A very thourough warm-up leads into  a tremendous workout that keeps your pulse elevated and ends with a great  toning section for the legs utilizing the kicks you've just learned.  A  bonus ab work rounds out a perfect tape.  Also feautured is trainer Kelli  Roberts. from Cher's first video and the star of her own two excellent step  video.  Hope someone signs Kelli up for her own kickboxing tape!"
5,"This product isn't really one to review but it does what it advertises. I use this in conjugation with a one spot and a boss daisy chain coming from my TU-3 (great tuner by the way). Starting to build my pedal board so I figured better to start off with a 30 dollar power source than to go and spend like two hundred on a T-Rex fuel tank. which I'm planing on in the future. Great adapter for all of your pedals. decent quality. and only ten bucks. Can't beat it!"
12,"This is the best shoot em up on the N64. I was very impressed with the game play. the graphics. the action. the multi player fun. everything.... the only downfall about the game is I wanted more. more. more. The cheats are great when you unlock them and the best thing is you dont need a memory card. everything saves on the cartridge. RARE actualy managed to compress a game that was too big for the N64 into this game somehow. and it suprises me that it does not even use the N64 Expansion pack to do that!!! This game is not just hoursand hours of fun. but days. weeks. years . i still play this cool game even today!"
7,"It is flexible. can hold 50+ pounds (lbs). and sit on practically any railing up to 6-inch wide incl. thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets.  You can ignore the manufacturer's claim that the bracket can adjust 2-6 inches.  When using only 1 or 2 bracket's bolts (of 3) closest to the pot's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat (bar) of the L-shaped clasp - the vertical clasp's flat (bar) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches.  It is safe to use just 1 bolt. as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force. which can very little pull (shear away) the bolts. one of which can easily handle.  However. the overall look is less than inspiring."
5,"I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before.  It just didn't seem to want to hang on. so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement.This is what I chose. and notably. I chose it for the color. just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar.So far. it's given me no problems. and it looks very nice and functions perfectly.  This is a great bargain. too. since it's certainly not an expensive accessory."
4,"Besides the religious backdrop. the main crux of this movie is to depict as much realism and authenticity as possible about the corporeal punishment during the Roman times. From the religious view point. the movie wants you to feel visually what your Lord has gone through.If you think that the 39 lashes were just mere whips. you are quite misinformed. Read Josh McDowell's book on Crucifixion and  you will get the written version about the instruments used during Jesus' time. Again. the crucifixion itself was shown under full light with no turning away of the camera.In my opinion. the movie has achieved. in stellar proportions. what it had set out to do. The additional depiction of Mary's love for her Son was well constructed. although not documented the way the movie has shown. All in all. the theatrical effects are moving and they are a good reminders for believers.Good work. Mel!"
5,"Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings.  I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way.However. I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine.  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate.  Therefore. strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds.  I also love the d'Addario make.  Which I purchase through Amazon...always."
10,"I purchased this attachment a couple months ago. and it has proven to be a real surprise.  Since it is an inexpensive tool. with the more inexpensive chisels and bits included. I didn't expect it to be a precision tool. but  it really does well.  I have now used it to make mortises in red oak. white  pine. and southern yellow pine. and am glad that I didn't spend more money  than I did.  The other reviewers are absolutely correct that set-up is time  consuming. but for a hobbyist woodworker like me. it does the job  efficiently. cheaply. and well.  I would definitely purchase this item  again."
7,"I've had this electric broom for about a year. It lacks the power of a corded blower but nonetheless it does the job for me. I use it to clean up the sidewalk and driveway after mowing the lawn or after a windy period leaves a mess. It works great and I can do my front yard and back yard areas on a single battery charge.I wouldn't recommend this for blowing leaves off a lawn as it may not have enough force to make that job easy. I don't own another blower and don't expect to because I don't feel I need to. In the fall when our trees drop their leaves we rake them.We now have four B&D; tools that use the same type of 18V battery. All four batteries are constantly in their charging stations so are always ready for use in any of the four tools. This is a successful design that is flexible for our use."
5,"Got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me. my guitar. and my sound.I'm a 62 YO newby to guitar!! This proves that easy helps. I have a big baby Taylor and when i needed new strings I went to the wrong place. got Martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me.  Sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. My friend said that he uses D'Addario and that they make ALL the difference in the world!! Tried them and he was right.  I changed my own (on the big Baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the E and B string like the dealer did!) MY Taylor recommends Elixr. but the D'Addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!!"
12,"This game I grew up with and enjoy very much. I have been playing this game since I was 6 or 7 years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new. What I have is a like new version but unforutantely I lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe I will find it one day while I shop around the internet. I love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the like."
4,"OH MY GOSH!!! What a fabulous movie. Daniel Craig is HOT and gives a magnificent performance to boot! I must say. the Brits know how to write a mystery. There are more twists and turns than Duncan spinning his yoyo! Nothing is as it seems. No one is as they seem. Who is the body in the ice house? Has the woman accused of murdering her husband ten years prior snapped again. or is it a sick coincidence?It's hard to tell when the body is so badly mauled. How long has he been dead? Who is he? Did the wife finally bring the body of her long-lost-and-thought-dead husband out of cold storage? These are just the tip of the mystery iceberg that is the &#34;Ice House.&#34;Watch if you like procedural police shows. mysteries. British mysteries. and especially if you love Daniel Craig. YUMMY!"
5,"Price:Very reasonable price for what they do.Comfort:These stay on your head very well and are comfortable. I have not noticed ear irritation yet.Noise reduction:These are absolutely stellar at noise reduction. These block so much sound. you no longer have to blast your music to hear over your drums. They also don't distort out side sound. Some over ear headphones distort outside sound horribly.Sound quality:Crisp mid and high range. When it comes to the low end. these are lacking. And if you blast your music the low end distorts. But they block sound so well you don't have to blast them.Why not just buy in ear head phones. and over ear muffs?I have tried this many times due to not being able to find good head phones. It is very annoying. doesn't work very well. and looks pretty dumb too. These head phones are a much better solution."
10,"I must own about 20 DeWALT tools and this is a frustrating tool.  For the most part I really like DeWALT tools but this one needs to be redesigned.  The blade will not track straight.  The problem seems to be in the blade mounting system.  I have never had a problem with the blade coming loose. however as you screw the cap to tighten the blade you can see the plunger start to turn as you crank down on this thing.  Since you tighten to the right. the blade will end up pointed to the right.  Now I have found that if you back off slightly you can line it up. but that's not the way a jig saw should work.  I think that in this case you would be better served with a Bosch."
12,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst. you start on a small island. told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven. you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
8,"I am really liking this product after all.  I was not sure it would stay warm for long. but it really does.  I have not determined how long yet. but hours more than anything I have ever used.  I put it outside under a blanket in a small house to keep a cat warm. and I think tonight was the first she was on it!  Even if the cat does not like it in the end (I had an electric warmer before and she was afraid and would not go in the house) I am keeping it to warm my bed before I get under the covers!"
5,"Holy guacamole. you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase. then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too."
9,"This is a compact. handy. well made tool.  I debated giving it 4 stars because the handle material seems thin and perhaps a bit fragile. but. so far it holds up great and takes up very little space. all things considered. I also have a few Smith's diamond sharpeners and the DMT beats them all.  The folding design protects the surface when closed and provides a handle when open.  Tip: when using this as a typical bench whetstone. lean the far end of the sharpener on the table top.  Only add water or use it dry - anything else will gum it up.  Although this angles the stone. it steadies it. making for solid grining angle and surface.  I've sharpened a collection of knives and even got a really good edge on some scissors I was debating tossing - fist time sharpening scissors.  Look out edged tools!This is one of those tools I'd buy again to have a back-up.  MADE IN USA."
3,"I have read a few of Karen Erickson's books previously and overall she's a pretty good writer. I enjoyed this book. but it wasn't something I was thinking about much after finishing it. Not a huge amount of depth to the heroine. I had some trouble relating to her with her need for useless spending. but she did have great chemistry with the hero and I liked that there wasn't a huge 'end of the relationship' moment like many romances. rather the characters progressed in their relationship without tons of drama. Overall a good read and I would read this author again. the rest of the series would be worth checking out also."
12,"While being an excellent RPG. it is not up to the caliber of the originals. especially III(US)/VI.  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value.  Its a onetimer.  I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again.  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game. namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX).  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff. ie. master materia. just isn't worth it.  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets. but only really worth playing once."
8,"Our lab carries around sticks. rocks. you name it wherever she goes. This particular style of Nylabone is exceptional because of the design.  There are two ridges that fit their incisors perfectly so they can carry it around without worrying it will slip out and break my foot if she drops it!~ Also. even though not flavored. she likes to work on it slowly. which means for the money it will last a long time.  We've spent a lot on the other types of designs and she liked them but they were either to destructible or too heavy for her to walk around with for any amount of time.  For whatever reason. it seems to calm her to carry a bone around and this is the best designed. tough and perfect size for a large dog. She says THANK YOU:)"
10,"I earn an income visiting construction sites.  More rough carpenters use this circular saw then any other (including the Skil HD77M).In March of this year. I bought the HD77 used ...to replace a low-end Black & Decker which was purchased new for $50 in 1981.For DIY projects around the house. the heavy-duty. smooth operating HD77 has yet to disappoint.  Initially. I had to get used to the weight and the ergonomics.  The cuts were smooth with no irritating startup kickback.  Plywood and sonotubes; no problem.With the increasingly harsh Toronto area winters. the oil in the HD77 requires to be room temperature warm prior to using the saw in the great outdoors of ours.With proper maintenance and care. this saw will be a vital and permanent tool for rough carpentry."
4,"Well this is one of the best gore movies I have ever seen. Pretty much that is what this movie is. 2 hours of a man being beaten and tortured. Ranks up there with Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and any Romero film. I actually was laughing near the end of it because of how over the top this movie is. How anyone can get a religious experience out of this is beyond me. Not to mention how hypocritical the religious nuts are to say they condemn violence yet they love this movie. Well if you are a horror film fan who appreciates good make up and gore then this ranks up there with some of the best. Who would have thunk that Mel Gibson would make one the goriest violent films of all time that would appeal to two different groups. As far as content goes and story line. this is not the movie for you. There is nothing of substance here. nope just two hours of beatings and torture."
10,"Ordered the 120 to check it out first. since I have never used Mirka before. I'm also confused on so many positive reviews. I found the discs cut really well and smooth out of the gate. but do not last long at all. Freud lasts longer for me. just hate the universal hole pattern they have. I'm pretty much using one disc per rail and stile of a cabinet door. That's not much life. Maybe it holds up better with a heavier grit prior to 120? My planer leaves wood fairly smooth. I'm used to going 120 from the planer. on up in grits. Oh well. On the search again."
2,"They are so quick and efficient.  When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep. that's how much I love them.  My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.  However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.  So he bought me this smaller version.  Obviously it weighs less. takes up less room in my cupboard. and comes to heat much quicker.  What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!"
3,"I love romances that are 'real' and this one is so very real. The characters are not larger than life. they have pasts. things they regret and dreams they have forgotten. They are real everyday people with everyday problems.When they find each other. their feelings re-awaken who they used to be and help them stand up and be that person.I loved this book. it was beautiful. sweet. sad in places and oh ever touching. watching the changes that true love brings to their outlook on life."
3,"Rating 4 1/2 starsI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not compensated in any way.Brett Andrews has an apartment above his club.  And Lisa is waiting for him.  This is a great way to start off this story.  Leo is an old friend of Lisa&#8217;s that&#8217;s come to the club.  The ending will leave you wanting to read more about this trio and having more of the club experience.Kallysten feeds on her reader&#8217;s need for a sexy vampire &#8211; especially for those of us that are female.  She paints a great picture of what happens when new meets old.  There&#8217;s nothing dark or sinister about what this group has.  If you&#8217;ve never read this author before. why not try this series.  If you love sexy. erotic. vampire short stories you can&#8217;t go wrong by reading Kallysten.  She&#8217;s a great author that knows how to pack a lot in just a few pages.  She never disappoints her readers."
8,"I've tried some of the major competing brands in an effort to save a few bucks. but Frontline continues to provide the best results for fighting fleas (on my three beagles and two cats).Last year. Frontline helped eliminate a flea infestation on my cats. when used in conjunction with other flea control solutions throughout my house. This year. we adopted three beagle puppies that were covered with fleas when we got them. Used Frontline again. at the recommendation of our vet. and the fleas were wiped out before they had a chance to re-infest our home.Continuing to use Frontline now to maintain our &#34;flealessness&#34;. I don't think Frontline Plus is perfect (It's expensive and doesn't seem to always last a full month). but for my pets. it's the best available and none of them display any adverse reactions to it."
4,"A tape or DVD of this show should be owned by every family in America. The level of care and loving craftsmanship seen here is something we are likely never to see again in the production of a film or show for children.This is demonstrated most of all. of course. in the music.'Silver and Gold'. 'Holly Jolly Christmas'. 'We Are Santa's Elves'.'There's Always Tomorrow'. 'The Most Wonderful Day of the Year'(whose eyes can stay dry through that one?) - all original compositions with full orchestral and choral accompaniment for a single TV show!For generations now. 'it isn't Christmastime until 'Rudolph' comes on'. Even if the networks give up airing it. I know my family will be cueing up this video every year the calendar's page is turned to December - I hope your family will be too."
12,"Lunar silver star story complete is the best remake ever! Blows away the original in every possible aspect. from graphics to story.+ one of the best 2d graphics ever. everything is crisp and detailed with great anime sequence+ new soundtrack is great. the only song boat blow me away+one of the best cast of characters ever+ a great story reworked. a great improvment over the original+ no random battle+ the battle are pretty difficult ( specially the boss battle)+ voice acting is good+ new extras+ great package- the gamplay is on the simple side- again a little sidequestsnow. my classification of the first lunar versions.lunar silver star story complete (ps) 10/10 masterpiece !lunar silver star harmony (psp) 8/10 downgraded version of the playstation masterpiecelunar the silver star (sega cd) 7/10 good.. but very obsolete. overshadowed by silver star storylunar legend (gba) 0/10 pure garbage"
4,"I am not a 'religious' person. however. I felt it was important to see this movie.  If nothing else. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.After sitting through a very quiet showing. my wife and I got up and walked out without saying a word.  It took a while for the movie to sink in.  Nobody was talking as they left the theatre.It was a moving experience.  Graphic and disturbing.  Something I am glad that I sat through. but can't see adding this to my movie collection.More interesting than the movie itself. is the reaction of those who liked or disliked it.  Reading the reviews of this movie is a great way to see the cultural divide in our country."
12,"This pretty good. it has a good story. great in-game movies and adequate gameplay. However most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to Red Alert. This is simply not true. The two games have  almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game. In saying this  I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay  from Red Alert. Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring  helicopters and cheap &quot;hover units&quot;.However this game is  not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics.  featuring performances by several Hollywood stars (well maybe not stars but  close enough). The graphics are pretty good but other games have done  better.Sure it's a classic and if you really like the series go  ahead and buy it. But if you want the true best strategy game of 1999. go  and check out Homeworld it's a far better game."
9,"It is an OK lantern that provides light at night. I did not try it out using unleaded gasoline. so I am going to assume it works OK using it (We used Coleman Fuel for it.) It is not too heavy to carry around. although it is way too heavy to hang on their very own Coleman Packaway Deluxe Camp Kitchen as the pole sways way too much. It was easy to setup and the included mantles worked great.The big issue on the one I received was that the adjustment knob was too sensitive to adjust the intensity to anything other than Off. Low. or High. There was no way to adjust it anywhere in between."
8,"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However. since Purina developed the smart-blend. she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes. change isn't better."
8,"These are a great price. and my dogs can't get enough of them!  I give them as gifts occasionally to friends with dogs. and they find their dogs love them as well.  I highly recommend.  I have two German Shepherd mixes (one with jaws of steel I think) and they stand up to the test.  Eventually they are worn down to nothing. but that usually takes 2 or 3 months. even with my more active chewer.Warning though. you don't want to step on these in the middle of the night!"
4,"Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona. but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued. not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved. and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies."
7,"This is as good as advertised for a car and I've used it for that and will keep it in the car.  But for me the good news is the threads in the snow brum head and handle are the same as with household poles for extending roller brushes or attaching mops.  I really wanted the snow brum to clear the snow off a large hot tub cover and was able to quickly attach the heat to a 10' extension pole.  The handle that comes with it won't quite reach all the way across the cover."
8,"I have two dogs who LOVE Nylabones. They have at least 30 Nylabones and they still get excited when they get a new one. This Galileo is my Chocolate Labrador's favorite toy. He is a dog who needs to be occupied otherwise he will eat anything in sight and this toy keeps him occupied for a long time. He has a very strong jaw and this Toy seems to be invincible. I would say that this is the perfect toy for a large dog who has a strong jaw. I would not recommend it for a dog who has small or fragile teeth because this is a very heavy and hard toy and I think potentially it could hurt the teeth of a smaller dog. Also. Keep in mind that since this toy is heavy it could potentially scratch your floor when your dog drops it out of its mouth. We have both Hardwood and Tile floors and I haven't had any issues yet but it does make quite a large bang when it hits the floor."
4,"This is not a DVD. this is a world-wide experience. Everytime I watch this DVD. I realize exactly what Jesus did to save me and.as painful and hard as it is to watch. I love HIM even more. It's not for the faint of heart. it's not the traditional family movie. It is however a very essential DVD to receive as your own personal copy because it teaches you things through words and actions no other movie can teach you. I hope all who gets it appreciated all the effort taken to keeping it authentic in language. events and the message being told. Contrary to what happened to the director. this is his finest work. A masterpiece and a classic."
2,"Heavy. smooth action. sharp.  My husband makes an ultra-deep-dish 'priazzo' about 2 inches deep. and this cuts right through - extra pepperoni. extra veggies. extra cheese. extra thick crust. it can handle it all!  Plus. it feels good in your hand.  Nice piece of equipment.Update 7/3/12: I suddenly realized a couple of weeks ago that this wheel wasn't working as well as it used to. so I decided to sharpen it for the first time. It was a little tricky to run through my Chef's Mate. but it's working a little better now. I'm thinking I'll need to replace it in a year or so. Still. it was used about once a week for about 4.5 years; if I get another year out of it. that's not too shabby!"
10,"I just used this kit for the first time. I was gluing some melamine sheets with Roo Glue (specially made for melamine) The set up time was 15 minutes. so I had a lot of surface area to cover in short order. This glue kit. using the glue roller did a nice job. It enabled me to cover a lot of surface area quickly. The amount of glue that is released is based on how much you squeeze the container. You can easily see the flow. so guesstimating is pretty easy.My only dilemma is when doing biscuits and glue edge joinery; it is necessary to switch heads. When you are dealing with glue that is sure to get messy. So my quest is to find a dedicated biscuit joining glue bottle. That way I can use both at the same time without making head changes.I think this kit is a great idea. It might be all plastic. but is ideally suited for the purpose. Highly recommended."
8,"We use Frontline Plus for flea control because it works. We started with Advantage when our Golden was younger. and that worked well. too... but our dog likes to swim and Frontline is waterproof so we switched. She is 8 yrs old now and has never had a flea - which is amazing since we live in S.CA. near the beach where fleas abound and visit parks all the time. You are supposed to put on monthly... I end up putting on every other month and in winter every 2-3 months... seems to work fine with those intervals. Frontline isn't cheap - but Amazon has best price... Our Costco started carrying it for the same price. but no tax and free shipping gave Amazon the edge."
8,"This product is a great buy for the money.  I shopped around a lot and couldn't find anything to compare.  This is the second one I bought.  I've had the first one almost a year and it's still working.  It is pretty quiet and the timer works well.  My cats don't try to break into it like others seem to do.  It won't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep (since it's just water in plastic) but works well for a weekend away.  It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too!"
9,"The 6 piece set was more than I actuallly needed. but I didn't know where I was going to mount the speed bag and so I got the whole kit.  The speed bag is really good quality and the swivel is better than I thought it was going to be.  It is nice to have both the wrap and the gloves if you are a beginner because you may find that one suits you better than the other.  I did not end up using the platform but the frame leads me to believe that it is very sturdy.  The jump rope. ah. the jump rope is a nice touch and it is nice to have. but i's nothing special.If you are looking for a fun and challenging arm workout the speed bag is a lot of fun to learn. It is not about punching something as hard as you can it is about controlling your punch.  I like it. it's fun and it's a really good outlet on very bad days."
9,"Awesome Sharp knife. Had the old version for about 10 years and never needed to sharpen. It was not the skeleton like this but they do not make the non-skeleton version anymore of this. My old Gerber disappeared one day and I was sick about it. had a lot of memories tied to that knife. LOL...So decided to get this updated version of the model called the e-z out skeleton that they are selling now. SHARP. HOLDS an Edge and just kicks bottom. Took about a week to get use to flipping the blade out with one hand and thumb but now have that mastered.Love this knife so much keep it beside the bed at night and it is the first thing I look for when getting dressed in the morning."
2,"I've always loved cake decorating. ever since I took my first Wilton class.  Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.  It's a lot of fun but. I admit. a bit frustrating.  No matter how closely I follow the steps. my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.  I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book. as all Wilton Lesson Plans. it's great."
4,"I've had this tape for a little over a year. and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently. this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!"
2,"We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.  I wasn's thrilled about having to buy another Rival product. but this ice cream maker is so far above others we've used that I can recommend it to anyone who has the $$ to buy it. All metal parts. including the motor. are of heavy steel.  The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.  It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.  Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day. a batch will last a couple of days.  The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.  This gives a smoother. well-mixed ice cream.  We'll use it year-round. setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture."
3,"I have always had dogs and read dog books.  Recently got a kitten - turned big-boy cat and thought I might enjoy this book.  It was extremely difficult to read.  Almost caused me to have a panic attack.  If these things really go on out there - I guess I have been living under a rock.  A colleague was going to get it for his 9 year old daughter and I said NO  Not a book for kids to read.  I am hugging my big boy cat as I write this.  I will be on the lookout for any other Sisypuss vagabond cats out there from now on.AS BOB BARKER WOULD SAY:  SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PET (and anyone else's you can afford to)."
7,"If you need an edger. and don't want the trouble of maintaining a gas-powered edger. this is the electric edger for you. It's more powerful than most. and sturdy as all heck. But it's also pretty light. too. Very easy to move around the yard.This tool is as indespensible as my lawn mower. If you're edging your lawn with a string trimmer. or not edging your lawn at all. you'll love the results you can get so easily with this edger."
12,"Doom for PS1 is a great game. Almost every level from Ultimate Doom & Doom II is here. plus some new levels never before seen on the PC. This game is dark. scary as hell. and can really get in your head. The soundtrack is totally different from the PC. and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do. The controls are easy to learn. that's a good thing. However. the only reason why I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the graphics. Yes. as you may have already read. the graphics are a bit sluggish. especially when compared to the PC version. In my opinion. the best version of Doom is the PC version. period. Doom. Doom 2. and Final Doom are the best video games ever. in MY opinion."
8,"I  fed this food during the hottest days of summer. as it has a lot of moisture to it. I prefer to feed dry food. but every other or every third day I have been feeding Felidae. During the hottest weeks one can was all I needed for four cats. A fourth of a can filled them up at once. though sometimes they came back a couple hours later and finished the portion. I feed under. and to the side of the air conditioner to keep the food fresher during the hottest days.Then they also have a pan of dry food in the bedroom. and another in the kitchen.I feel very confident with Felidae because of it being made in the United States.I have rinsed out the can and poured some of the water in with the food. Big mistake. they won't eat it. They won't eat it with anything mixed in it. i.e. pieces of cooked chicken.Straight from the can they seem to really like both flavors I have been buying."
12,"This has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the Nintendo 64. This kind of game is great for all ages. I'm 18 years old and my friends and I still. to this day. continue to play Mario kart. It is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours. You can play it by yourself. but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others. There is really no story line to the game. just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with. If you get bored of racing over and over again. there are several mini games. known as battle games. to choose from. Honestly. I like playing the battle games more than I like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family! So. overall I would definitely say get this game if you don't have it! It is a must buy for avid Nintendo 64 users!"
12,"Yes I said ONE of the best games ever made ...but not THE best. This game falls right behind... XENOGEARS. You probably havent played it since its very hard to get. But it's definently. in my opinnion the best game ever ...and if u have the chance then get it!!Anyways. FF7 has great graphics but the character models are totally ugly. The backrounds are very nice though. and so are the FMV'sThe gameplay is fun and addicting except ...THE BATTLE SYSTEM. Why is it that every Final Fantasy game has had a completely boring battle system. Why can't they make them like Xenogears??? Xenogears had a very very great and fun battle system. With battles like this in FF7. you'll always be wishing not to run into a enemy.The sound is perfectThe controls are easyThis game is great. period. And if you havent bought it yet then you are insane.Besides Xenogears. no game comes close to this"
9,"4 month update!well after about 4 month it has completely lost it's sharpening ability. minding that i do a lot of cutting. and I used this on every knife around the house. However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer. all an all i'm going to switch to sharpening stones.My Initial review:Sharpens the knives like never before! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it). rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade. works very well on a variety of steel grades."

8,"It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not. My friend's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them. He has this one still after several months. The head is gone. but the rest is intact. My boyfriend's dog. however. only picks it up when she knows I'm waiting for her to play with it. My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around. if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp."
9,"I have a quite a few knives in my collection. ranging from spyderco's. benchmade. cold steel. ka bar to name a few. and this sharpener puts an extremely sharp and fine edge on all of them. It even makes cheap Chinese made knives hair shaving sharp. The DMT is by far the best and most simple to use sharpening stone I have ever come by. basically no skill is required to sharpen a knife with it. And hey it's made in the USA right in Massachusetts so u get good American quality. Don't think about it. just buy it!!"
12,"Street Fighter Alpha 3 - Circa 1999GOOD:- Good Balanced 2D fighter. considered a classic to many hardcore 2D fighting fans- Lots of modes to unlock and lots of fighters to choose fromBAD:- Loading times. very short but still there- Graphics might be dated for some peopleWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- Not over the top like Guilty Gear X/X2. Marvel Vs Capcom. or Capcom Vs SNK- Old School type game play and not combo heavyGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- King of fighters 2000 and up- Fatal Fury: Mark of WolvesADDITIONAL NOTES:- Last game in the Street Fighter 'Alpha' franchise (as of 1999)- Has all fighters from Street Fighters Alpha 1 and 2 as well as a few from the old time Street Fighter's like Street Fighter II: The world Tour- Street Fighter Alpha is called Street Fighter Zero in Japan- Practicality same game on Sega Dreamcast"
5,"A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there. but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal."
8,"First Impression: Man it was time for a new Nylabone. Mom and Dad bought me my first two almost 5 months ago! They were looking a little nasty. but I still loved them. The kind folks over at Nylabone sent me a gift box and I got to try out this new monster of a chew bone. Now it is shaped a little weird. but I like it none the less. Every time Mom and Dad eat lunch or dinner I lay down and chew on a Nylabone. It keeps me entertained while they eat that amazing smelling human food... I just close my eyes and pretend.Conclusion: Great chew bone! Lasts a very long time. Not sure what could be improved."
7,"I purchased this grill. but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed cooking on it.  With the chimney starter. it is almost as fast to get this grill ready to cook as it is to get a gas grill ready - and you should let your meat set out for about 20 minutes before you grill. so you really haven't lost that much time.The ash catcher is a great feature and don't forget to get the rotisserie attachment.  You haven't had turkey for thanksgiving until you've had a rotisserie turkey!Real Men cook with charcoal and wood and this is the best grill I've ever owned."
8,"My male cat loves these bubbles. but he loves playing with bubbles anyway.  My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles.  This formula makes LOTS of bubbles!  And it's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip.  This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat!  There is a slight smell. but it doesn't really bother me (I'm very sensitive to chemical smells).  I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip.  He doesn't act the way he does with the herbal catnip..."
9,"I had one for my XD and now have a few more items I wish to keep SAFE from others using.  Not only a great price they are awesome to use and easy to change the codes for locking/unlocking.  I had lost the directions form my years ago one and nor have the easy instructions to change the codes.  Insert a pin into the opening and change the codes. how easier can it be. I could of had a V8 moment when I saw this....Silly me for forgetting..."
2,"I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.  This one is my current favorite for several reasons.  First. I like the 4-qt. size.  It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.  Next. I'm happy with the  quality of the product.  It's hefty enough to feel substantial. yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.  The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.  Last. this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt. model.  I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one. but I like the speed.  I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.  I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again."
9,"After becoming pregnant. I've tried to carry water with my everywhere and not in a plastic container (due to chemicals. BPA. etc.) This sig coated aluminum works great - it doesn't have a taste and it cleans very easily with a bottle brush. and the lid with the hole is very very handy for toting around on my finger or carrying with one hand.I've actually dropped it several times so it has a few dents now. but I am glad I went with these instead of a glass bottle. which is also supposed to be very good to drink out of. but that would definitely have shattered by now. The little dents don't bother me and the outside color/finish is still fine. I prefer this size to the larger SIG sizes as it is not too heavy to carry around in my purse. and this has never once leaked on me. It keeps water nice and cold for a short time too."
7,"I wanted a heating pad so I figured I'd get the whole kit.  This kit is a bit disappointing because the plastic dome does not fit well on the base so there is an air gap.  I have this sitting on a wooden floor and the heater has worked fine.  I just think it was very overpriced for what I got.  The plastic parts are thin and would require me to be careful if I want to use them for years to come.  I had hoped for better."
8,"When frontline first came out it was strong enough that 1 dose would last on one of my dogs for over two months. it's not that strong anymore it seems.  It does however. work really well.  I want to use it specifically because it kills fleas as eggs and adults.  It will help with ticks but they are very hard to get rid of.  I get this size pkg and divide it up between my 8 dogs who range in size from 22lbs to 90 lbs. My vet gave me a syringe to get the liquid out of each of the vials and advised me on the correct dose for each dog.  It really saves money!"
12,"Super Mario 64(1997) When I first got Nintendo 64.it came with Super Mario 64.When the system was hooked up.I put in the game.and was amazed on how the graphics were!It was excellent.The graphics were great.the music was cool.and Mario never looked better!This game is for everyone.I thought Banjo-Kazooie was a great game.but move over Banjo.Mario is back!The best game ever.Features new worlds.characters.setting.and don't worry some of the old villians from the early Mario games are here.and can't forget Bowser and Princess Toadstool(Peach).Better than any 64 game ever made!"
12,"Ocarina Of Time is definitely the best game on the Nintendo 64.Super Mario 64.Perfect Dark and F Zero X are awesome but Ocarina Of Time is the best out of any other game on the system.What else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at Role Playing games forever?The graphics are awesome(some Game Cube games dont look this good) the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellent.Whereas the difficulty in Super Mario 64 stayed pretty much the same throughout the game Ocarina Of Time gets harder when you get to be a better player.Also you get an extra heart after beating bosses because youll need it.Its very challenging I still havent beaten it and am not sure if I ever will.Easy games can be a lot of fun but they just arent as substantial as a game like this.The challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls. Its just a great game and is a must for any Zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging games."
4,"The cast of Stomp is a great addition to this DVD.  My daughter fell in love with it the first time we watched it and asks for it repeatedly.  More importantly. it is not overly annoying to adults.How I rated this DVD:* Educational value.  Since buying this DVD my daughter has become very interested in making her own music.  I have found her stomping. making drums from rubbermade containers. and trying to blow in bottles.  She is only 20 months old and I think this is very impressive since we have only had the tape a few weeks.* Entertaining to child.  Keeps her entertained through the whole video.* Entertaining to adults.  I can even watch the tape with her and not become mindlessly numb.* The DVD starts right at the menu.  No annoying commercials to sit through.* Cost.  The video did not break the budget.  It was reasonably priced."
10,"If you are using this saw without clamps to hold what you are cutting. STOP RIGHT NOW if you value your fingers.Get one of two of these clamps! They are simple. well made and make your saw much safer. They can be mounted to the saw in a second. and can quickly and securely hold what you are working on. They have a quick release button and a micrometer type fine adjustment for tension. They swing out of the way easily when you don't need them. The rubber foot to hold the work piece is nice and big.Expensive? You Bet!  Overpriced? Absolutely! But then again. you have to ask yourself how much your fingers are worth to you!"
2,"Get the Presto. They're all the same. It's a simple design. a pot and lid. I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different. The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons. My kitchen is filled with the best and most expensive equipment money can buy. but when it comes to pressure cookers. it's not like other cookware where you 'get what you pay for.'  They're all the same (although I don't recommend the electric ones as they have a tendency to break down). Save your money for the good espresso maker... don't waste it on expensive pressure cookers. Get the Presto."
9,"This knife is perfect for on your keychain carry. I went to a bbq this weekend and it was used multiple times for three different things. I had to pull it off my keychain because everyone needed a bottle opener for there beer. The scissors were used to open a capri sun that the straw was lost for a kid. And the knife was used to open a present. And when I told people it also has a pen they were shocked! awsome little knife just get it and put it on your keychain."
4,"I remember clearly when Hardware Wars came out. with my sister and me howling with laughter at the clever parody. We loved Spaceballs. with its jabs. too. Being a great fan of both the Star Wars trilogy and of Shakespeare in Love. I was laughing out loud at this deft combination of the two done in a mere 9 minutes. It's like the super-fast-Shakespeare spoof which is making the theater rounds - a blast to catch all the subtle innuendos!What's the cost for the video - about the price of a Big Mac these days? I'd gladly pay double for the fun this has been at parties and when friends come over. I don't have this much fun with a lot of commercial sludge that's out on the big screen. that's for sure! Well worth it ... but see for yourself!"
7,"Purchased as part of the cordless homecare package this trimmer is by far the best unit for our subdivision home. As the homecare package has three batteries and a three bank charger we're never out of power. It will do medium to light trimming and edging without skipping a beat. Light and easy to use. just pick-up and go. The cordless broom cleans up the mess in and flash and your done!Gone are the years of frustration and struggle weilding a gas powered unit. or getting sore yanking the cord trying to start it. Or (ok. I admit it) throwing the gas powered units on the ground in frustration and disgust."
4,"I really wanted it to be a great romance and it maybe would of been had it not stopped all the time. I eventually stopped playing all together in my player. That was with the first disc. I can only say that the romance I thought was going to be there wasn't. Or at least not to my liking. It is about a young doctor that falls in love the head doctor of the hospital with his wife. He tells her that he loves her and that is as far as it went. because that is when it started to stop playing."
7,"Here in Heber Springs we have many deer roaming through the town. I have a problem keeping them from munching on my bushes and stripping the bark from my trees. Other than that. I love to see them wandering around. I have tried other products that keep the deer off of my plants and shrubs. they work. but my poor hands pay the price after applying them. When I saw this product with the battery powered spray. I had to have it. It works and my hands no longer suffer. What's not to love?"
4,"This is the American adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic.  It is interesting that in the movie the main character is seen ripping the pages out of a collector's item book of 'A Christmas Carol.'Henry Winkler gives an outstanding performance as Benedict Slade. a loan officer who reclaims valued possessions of those unable to make late payments on Christmas Eve.His visit by the spirits. the life in the orphanage and how one man helped him. leads to a very sentimental ending.It would have been good if the images could be enhanced for better viewing.  This originally was a 'made-for-TV' program and is presented complete with the fade-outs for the commercial breaks.David Wayne gives a great performance as the book owner as well as Christmases past."
10,"am using for 40k models. they are a great size for adding jet packs. i use them for both orks and space marines. my stormboyz just use death company jet packs and my death company are also assault for codex marines or other codexes. have also use dhtem for eldar guardian weapons platform. will buy again when i run out they work for all kinds of customizations and these are small enough that it doens't break superglue over time (1/4' and above do) also note glue on the magnets before you prime or they will also pull off you want superglue from plastic to magnet for best results then paint over it"
12,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE GAMES. I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO PLAY !!IT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE . NOT TO MENTION LOADS OF FUN TOO !! THERE ARE ONLY A FEW HARD BOSSES . BUT WORTH THE PLAYING TIME . ONE TIP . ALWAYS STOCK UP ON AMMO . AND USE THE FOUNTAIN OF REJUVINATION ALWAYS .THROW YOUR DRUMSTICKS AT ENEMIES FOR HEALTH PICKUPS; BUT YOU GET THEM LATER IN THE GAME.  USE YOUR CROSSBOWS FOR BOSSES -AND PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BOOKS SCATTERED THRU THE LEVELS .THEY GIVE YOU CLUES.ALL IN ALL IF YOU YOU WANT TONS OF FUN . THEN GET THIS GAME! YOU 'LL CERTAINLY PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN !!"
5,"This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range. although it only does one effect at a time. so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock. which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds. excluding the heavier metal sounds. this pedal will definitely get you there."
7,"I thought I liked the idea at first and am glad I waited to write a review because when we first got it we were so excited and could not wait to put them in everything until two birds ended up dead and we have more Mosquitos then we know what to do with!We do NOT recommend this to anyone unless you don't care about nature and other living beings!  Also if you enjoy getting bit all the time by all means buy this . but I would never again and I had to drop it off at our neighborhood program which we call STOP program which stands for Stop throwing out pollutants because we found out you cannot throw it in your regular garbage cause it is considered a poison!Terrible product!"
5,"I've seen Joey Jordison from Slipknot playing on a metal folding chair before. so i'm going to say right off the bat that you can play sitting on just about anything. It's pretty hard to make a crappy product when it comes to Drum Thrones. so with that I'm going to say you're either going to get a great product or something that you can't even use. In this case. you can look forward to getting a great product here! The stool is very sturdy. no rocking. no swaying. no moving at all. Very comfortable... in fact. my girlfriend grabs it to sit on every time she comes into my studio to hang out with me. Worth the money. great product!"
4,"That is right. God bless Mel for making one of the most loved and profound depiction of Jesus' crucifixion.Let's face it. there were people in this country who've had it in for Mel sice production on this film began years back. When the worst they predicted failed to materialize they looked like the alarmist fools they are. Mel's tirades just gave them any excuse they needed to attack him all over again.Where is the condemnation for Gary Busey and Billy Zane for starring in an outright antisemitic movie depicting Jewish doctors as ghouls lusting for the body organs of Arabs?Where was the outrage for Marlon Brando when he called Jews 'kikes' right on the Larry King Show?Or what about Russell Crowe who not only once referred to the Maoris of New Zealand as 'niggers' but hit somebody with a telephone?Mel did a really stupid. horrible thing with what he said.But you know what? Suck it up. Accept the asology and let the man get on with his life and the great flicks he makes."
9,"The DMT family of knife sharpening products are top shelf kit.  I use them in the kitchen and in the garage. from sharpening a shovel (yes. it really works better when the edge is sharp) to sharpening steak knives.  These were purchased to add to my truck tool box. small. easy to stow away.  They work very well. just remember to let the sharpening edge do the work for you. do NOT press down hard. you will just remove the diamond media and ruin the surface."
5,"Even though the title says 'Acoustic Guitar Case'. it's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins. I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo. and the reviews were good. Sure enough. the lining is soft and well-padded. The hardware works as it should. and the build quality is almost perfect. However. when closing the case. a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place. then everything is as it should be. The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly. and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around. The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case. It serves its purpose well. at a reasonable price."
12,"This is a more than ok game.Not the best.but good.If you like the &quot;Spyro&quot; series.you'll like this for sure.The gameplay. control.sound.etc. are all like the first 2.The only problem is it's EASY.Really.really easy.The levels are about 5 minutes long each.and the total gameplay span is about 7 hours.But still. thats better than it being hard.It's still pretty fun and stays true to the first 2.And Crash's little sister premires in it. Here's the review:Graphics:4/5Sound:5/5Music:3/5Fun:4/5Control:D-pad:3/5Analog:5/5Overall:4/5hould you buy it?:Yep"
2,"These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall. and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.  WIth both of them running on exhaust. the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.  There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.  I had no choice but to mount the fan on  the inner window frame for both windows. because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame.  The windows cannot be shut with the fan mounted. because they have a 'lip' at the bottom. that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window. to make opening and closing easier.  The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place. so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected (Hurricane Irene. for instance!)  Even so. the fan is easily removed. once the screws are in place."
2,"I've long been a fan of OXO utensils but I didn't think there was a good are bad when it came to peelers. I was wrong. I cook quite a bit and had used a peeler recently at my brother's house. When I got this one and used it. it was like night and day. It is surprisingly effective in peeling as if it were super sharp. but I've run it into my hand on accident a couple times and never been cut. There's something about the design of the blade that makes it pretty safe to use and still really quick at peeling. It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer. Nice little feature."
7,"When I originally set this up on our front porch railing. I was very pleased with the ease of it.  I was able to do it rather quickly and without assistance.  I chose to put a flower pot that has trailing vines in it. that way the frame would be hidden a bit and it looked great.  If I were to rate this item on that alone. it would get 5 stars.  But then I was at our local hardware & garden center and saw similar pot holders for half the price.  I ended up buying two of them in the same 10 inch size top add more pots to our front deck and they were just as easy to install and work just as well.  So for this I do drop this item down to 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good item. but why pay more than you should? I definitely recommend shopping around if saving money is as important to you as it is to me."
3,"My Thoughts - 5 out of 5 unicorns - I loved it!!!**Gifted to me by the author for an honest reviewOkay first things. this is a very adult erotic short story.  It is only about 25 pages. and it does have some very steamy sex scenes including some M/M/F.The cover is okay and shows the characters. but it doesn&#8217;t grab my attention.  You definitely don&#8217;t want to judge this book by its cover.Okay I loved this story. but if you aren&#8217;t into stories of threesomes or sex scenes then don&#8217;t read this story.  It is a quick read. but it totally had my attention.  You get glimpses into the lives of the 3 characters in this book and some background.  I&#8217;m not usually one for short stories. but Kallysten always does such a fantastic job of sucking me right into her stories.I totally recommend this book to paranormal romance lovers and to anyone who loves Kally&#8217;s work.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more of this series in the future."
3,"I am a huge Debbie Macomber fan. there's not too many books of hers that I haven't read.  After saying that. her best writing. in my opinion is her Cedar Cove series.  With 12 books total. the books follow a cast of characters through life and hardships.  The series starts with 16 Lighthouse road and ends with 1225 Christmas Tree Lane.  It's easy to know where you are in the series based on the title - the first number in the title is the corresponding number in the series.  Debbie Macomber's characters draw you in and make you feel as though you are part of the plot and by the time you have finished the book(s) you feel as though some of the characters are you best friends as with Olivia and Grace.  You meet them in 16 Lighthouse Rd and 204 Rosewood.  If you download this book/series. you won't be sorry.  Curl up in your favorite reading chair and be transported to Cedar Cove.  Enjoy!"

7,"Purchased this since my 09 honda fit had a light on for the tire pressure. Took it to the gas station but the light never went away since their gauge was inaccurate. I used the inflator and it was very easy to use. The hose clamped on and was able to get air and a good reading on the pressure gauge. I put too much air but luckily this has a built in pressure release so I was able to have exactly 33 psi on my tires. Whether that gauge is accurate or not my air pressure light went away. I also use this on my 99 jeep xj with problem. The gauge has rubber around it so it helps protect the glass. This gauge is nice and for the price you can't go wrong."
2,"I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.  My first meal was pressure cooked pot roast (from a recipe found on the internet). the best roast I've ever had!  Before buying this 6 qt. model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.  My only criticism is that. unlike my 8 qt.. this smaller model does not have a quick-release valve. so the traditional cold water method is necessary (and thus four stars rather than five).  While the 'jiggler' steam valve is reminiscent of much older models. Presto wisely added an emergency steam release valve--a welcome safety measure!  I recommend this model to those for whom quick-release valves rank low in priority."
12,"OH MY GOD! I've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a**!  The plot is amazing and totally unique (and never gets old) The characters are dynamic and well done. the combat system is well thought out. and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII.  The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics. but when everything else is so amazing. WHO GIVES A F***?  The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation. but as they get closer to bringing it down. they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth (the greatest villain ever concieved)tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet. but amke him an all powerful being.  Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience."
5,"Always buy D'Addario strings for my 7 guitars.  Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types.  They have a great rating from other musicians. ....and the price is very affordable.  Highly recommended by this writer.  It is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food. musicians. movies....etc.  We all have our likes and dislikes.....For my taste D'Addario EJ16-3D is usually the strings I drift back to whenever I buy strings.  I like their full sound and their lasting tones."
2,"I searched for an exhaust fan for our new. hot garage.  I did not believe some of the negative reviews and neither should you!  This fan fit right into our garage window and has been working every day for months!  Who cares if it is not made out of a heavy metal; you don't have to touch it except to turn it off and on.  It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.  Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.  With all my searching. Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.  What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?"
8,"On June 15 I adopted a 2yr old jack-a-poo which was rescue from a puppy mill. Every time he ate he would make strange sounds. He would also throw up a lot. The foster mom had him eating wellness brand. I had him for 2 months and really had no idea what to do.I switch him over to Purina Pro Plan Sensitive skin and Stomach just to see if that would help. I am surprise at  the result. It is like having a new dog. He no long makes sounds or throw up. If he drinks water to fast he coughs but. other then that this food has fixed his issues.I highly recommend this if your dog has issues eating they may just need a different diet."
4,"The Passion of the Christ (Definitive Edition) [Blu-ray]This film (and particularly the extra disk) is very useful for those particular individuals of the Christian faith who were not given the opportunity to learn about the finer aspects of Christ's Passion. specifically the Stations of the Cross.  Having grown up in the Baptist Church. I was not taught about the Stations. but strict emphasis was given to why Christ gave himself for us.  Additionally. the second disk amplifies the finer aspects of crucifixion. shows where the Stations of the Cross supposedly were in Jerusalem. and Christ's suffering as depicted in the Arts.  It is for these reasons that I recommend this disk set.  Whether or not one accepts Mel Gibson's interpretation of the Passion of Christ is up to the individual and how/what he/she believes."
9,"Dr. Bronner's products are very very good.  I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower.  A little goes a long way.  The main thing is that it really does work!  It will really clear up what ails ya!  I use it as a shampoo too!  My scalp has never felt better.  Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount.  If a soap product such as this suds up heavily... then it probably isn't good for you at all...  This one will suds up a little... and it cleans very very well.  If you have dry skin. ring worm or fungus type skin issues. this will really help it.  Meanwhile. using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay."
8,"I have a miniature dachshund that is addicted to table food. Normaly I leave dry food available at all times and 1 bowl of wet food a day. He has always been a picky eater. basically just wanted human food. Recently he would take a bite or 2 of his dry food and barely touch his wet. So we decided to switch dog food. and ended up choosing this. He LOVES this stuff. I can't leave dry down anymore because he gobbles it up before it hits bowl! Also we buy the containers on Beneful wet food. he loves that as well!Another thing that I love about this food is it makes his coat shiny and soft. Not sure how but ever since he started eating this he has had softer and shinier coat."
2,"when given the choice. i always buy oxo. it's the most comfortable for my hands. this pizza wheel is great. sharp. and cuts clean. and i found it for a steal at ross dress for less at $3.99!!!!!! would i buy it at amazon for the inflated price? uh. no. even if i didn't find it at $3.99. i would have bought it at bed. bath. and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons. amazon. if you want to stay competitive. price your items lower!"
10,"Bosch is the standard by which all other jig saw makers judge themselves. This in itself pretty much says it all. Once you use this tool. you will understand what that means.I prefer the barrel grip b/c it is easier for me to control. However. the handle model has all the same features. just a different grip configuration. so the choice is purely a personal one.This saw cuts through almost anything like butter. There is very little vibration. These features pair up to make your control over the tool excellent. and that is what you get a jig saw for!Changing blades is quick and easy. Changing the base angle is a snap.If you are looking for a jig saw you are going to have for a long time. then this is the tool to get."
8,"Purchased this Petmate Deluxe Fresh Flow a couple of weeks ago. It makes a soft running water noise. pleasant to hear. My cat immediately started drinking from it. as she loves running water. Keeps water fresh and clean for her. easy to reload - just unhook the cord from the plug and take to sink. Makes a loud noise when there is debris in it (bugs. food. whatever) to let you know it must be cleaned out! so much easier than refilling the water dish all the time..."
10,"After about ten years of use I have nothing but praise for the 505. Certainly does what it's designed for and continues without fail. Honestly a tool that's a pleasure for me to use in that it has a good feel and balance to itRecently replaced the cord and found the Delta/Porter Cable (SeviceNet)online parts system easy to navigate and with very reasonable prices for parts and shipping. I suppose the lack of dust collection can be a minus but for me personally I don't use dust collection except for table saw. although I do wear a mask when sanding. Excellent tool with exceptional durability."
9,"Love this product. it always works as advertised. I bought a 32oz bottle on October 31st. it is now December 31st and I have used maybe half an inch of this soap. The upfront cost is expensive. but this stuff is very cost effective since a 32oz bottle will probably last me 1.5-2 years. I bought a 4oz one for travel (they didn't have the smaller one in stock) and I imagine it will work for many years to come. One problem is that I dropped my 32oz bottle while in the shower and it broke the top part of the cap off."
10,"After reading the reviews here on Amazon and with the great pricing on the DW788. I took the plunge and ordered both the saw and the stand.I've used several scroll saws over the past 40 years. I can say this is by far the best I've ever used!There is no vibration to this saw and the cuts are easy and flowing. and did I mention how quiet it is?If you're looking for a solid scroll saw. pay a little extra and get a solid machine. you won't be disappointed in the DW788.  Better get a dolly when it arrives. very heavy. solid product  A++"
3,"I have become a big fan of this e-magazine. along with the Hitchcock. Asimov and Analog mags. You can't ask for better escapism on your Kindle. My long que of books to read are gathering dust due to my new fondness for short fiction stories. Can't go wrong for the price if you enjoy reading. My only gripe is not being able to view the cover in color on my Kindle. Guess I'll need to buy the new Kindle Fire for that. If you like mysteries. detective stories. etc.. you'll enjoy EQMM. If nothing else. try the 14 day free trial and find out for yourself."
8,"My cats love this food...and the price is right.( usually a bit cheaper than any store) If you'll read the ingredients. the FIRST ingredient is not chicken meal or some by product. it's real chicken!! The cats love it. and it's very nutritious. We took this bag to our Veterinarian and showed him what our cats were eating...he was pleased and said go ahead and feed them this..and he had tons of food in his office he could've tried to sell us for our one cat's sensitive tummy.  He said this food is great!!  We won't feed them anything else!"
3,"I found the emotions in this book to be very intense. The author did an excellent job writing this romance. I could feel the passion from Anna. and Nikos. There were some misunderstandings. that added to the suspense of the book. Anna was a strong Heroine. She had a backbone. and her pride. She came off all most too strong. It worked well in this story. because of how controlling Nikos was. He needed someone to stand up to him.Sample from chapter 2 - She felt the warmth of his breath. She could smell his skin. a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart. as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child. But Nikos was in no hurry. The seconds it took before his lips finally touched hers were exquisite torture. And when he finally kissed her the world seemed to whirl around them. making her dizzy. making her knees weak."
4,"Olivia de Havilland is at her best in My Cousin Rachel. I happened to catch this movie on TV and had never heard of it. I searched for it and found it and just had to ad it to my collection. Rachel is Manipulative. Deceptive and Conniving or isn't she? A black widow Spider. she mates and she kills or does she? This movie had me pulled into the story because you love Rachel and yet you hate Rachel. Olivia was a powerhouse and all the reason to see this movie. If you are a fan of Olivias then take a chance. this one will become a favorite for you as it did for me."
7,"This is the direct replacement part for the B&D; Grass Hog model NST2018.  I love that trimmer as it is easy to use and I don't have to fight with a gas powered trimmer and all the problems involved with using one.  This replacement spool directly fits onto the trimmer and is easy to change.  The trimmer is designed to automatically feed the trimmer line and I didn't want to mess with rewinding line onto the old spool.For me the 30 foot spool will last a whole cutting season or more and it is just easier to deal with than buying trimmer line and winding it yourself.  This is a good buy and works well.  I recommend it to you!"
2,"Excellent durability.  Good space inside and latches closed.  Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.  As built now. you will need two people to handle this huge bin.  Would also help if the handholds were deeper.  Overall. very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.  Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split. so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid.  And yes. the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.  Still. it's a decent box that continues to function okay."
4,"This is one of my favorite Sesame Street videos and we have several.  In this video. Telly learns that music can be made from many different things. as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects.  My favorite part has to be the 'can can' part with Oscar the Grouch.  The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue ('Cans?  We've got cans!' and 'Yeah. we'll go get them!').  Trust me. you've got to see that part.  It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too. she will sit through this one time and time again.  It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!)."
7,"These are essentially fancy leather welding gloves. Welding gloves have to protect you from being burned by spatters of molten metal. that cool almost immediately upon landing on a surface at room temperature. Cooking mitts. on the other hand. need to be able to hold a 400 degree object for many seconds without transmitting the heat. They also need to insulate even if they're wet.I found that this glove. despite being well made and attractive. is no good for holding hot items. At best. it protects hand and arm while grilling. if you're using tongs. lets say. over a very hot fire. Just don't expect to be able to hold a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds before the heat is conveyed directly to your tender skin and you have to put it down immediately or drop it."
8,"Our Apollo can't live without his Teddy! I've never had a dog so attached to his toy. He mangles it.runs with it and sleeps with it. Absolutely in love with it. It has held up better than any of his other toys...I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy. I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails. This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb. black Lab punishment...now that is a true test!!"
2,"I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products.  The meat tenderizer is another good product.  It is very ergonomic. and it's heavy/solid so that you don't have to pound as hard as you would with more lightweight tenderizers.I don't like the fact that you can't put it in the dishwasher. but really. scrub it with some anti-bacterial dish soap and you're all set.  After shopping at several home product stores in search of a tenderizer. I came back to the OXO Good Grips because I found it the best. in spite of not being able to put it in the dishwasher."
5,"These D'Addario  strings are great!  I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using. these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life.  Intonation is good and I've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat. even more so than my Sheraton.  Being from the 'old school' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper. but what can ya do? Besides that. I am totally stoked and happy with these.  I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good."
5,"...but for a small woman with small hands. it's difficult to operate.  It also exerts a whole lot of pressure on the strings. which can't be good for them.  I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock. a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both. if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.  When playing at home I'll use the more gentle Schubb."
8,"Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I've found. They are much sturdier (you won't stick your hand through) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up. These are pretty good sized. so it's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds.The packaging is well designed too. The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel. Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them. A++ product. If you have dogs. you really should try these baggies!"
9,"This must be more ideal for a handgun.  The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15. Remington 12 gauge. nor my Reuger .22.  The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger. however. when I tried that. I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun.  The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved.  I should have returned it. but I was lazy."
12,"Such a necessity that once I received it for Christmas I got rid of the Jumper Pak for good.The Expansion pak holds MUCH more memory.If you have games that need it ask mom and dad night and day to buy you an Expansion Pak.You really have no need for the Jumper Pak.The Jumper Pak is really hard to get out anyway.I had to use a knife to get the Jumper Pak out which cant be too good for the system but what the hey now the Expansion Pak is in and I dont need to worry anymore."
7,"Seems like every other week or so it randomly drops to 84 cents as an add on item. You simply cannot beat that price. I got several for my son and his friends to play with in the dirt and some for the front and back yard. It is a ridged plastic but dug fine in hard dirt for me. Don't go prying up rocks or it might break but for general digging it is just fine. But you can abuse it all you want and if it does break you are out less than $1."
7,"I own several Perky-Pet brand items and have always loved their products.  I really love EVERYTHING about this squirrel-proof. EXTRA LARGE bird feeder; except for the price.I have 5 other feeders in my fenced-in yard and the birds in my yard flocked to the feeder on the very first day I hung it up.  No clogging. no squirrels. great design and super easy filling are the main things I really like about this feeder. If you don't mind the price. I would urge you to purchase this feeder.  It is undoubtedly my favorite feeder in my yard!Happy Feeding!"
9,"This boat is for pool use only.  It did not hold up during a 4 hour. 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water.  By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy.  However. if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too."
9,"This is an excellent organic soap product.  Well worth the money.  Used for hand washing. I find that even a tiny amount leads to lots of sudsing and good cleaning.  Also leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.  My wife has found it to be  an excellent grease-cutter in the kitchen. and I have started using it in the place of our traditional Dawn dishwashing detergent for our dishes and pans.  Evenf for greasy pans it doesn't take a large amount. much less than I have to dispense with Dawn."
2,"Searched high and low for the perfect tongs for non-stick surfaces that didn't cost a fortune and of course found the OXO brand to perfectly fit the bill (as usual).  These are not too long. perfect for kitchen use.  Their tips are not the annoying soft silicone type like so many out there but instead a harder tip that is angled and pointed so you can use then for a number of surfaces or into pots of boiling things.  I really love the feel of these in my smallish hands and that they lock is an added bonus so they don't take up tons of room in your drawer.  Perfect!"
8,"I erroneously assumed that I'd get what was shown in all the photos - a T-Rex.  The listing title says &#34;dinosaur varies&#34; and the listing points include &#8226;Available in Brontosaurus. Stegosaurus and T-Rex.  There wasn't an option for me to choose. and I wish it had been clearer to me that the packers would chose what toy I was sent; I would have purchased this from a different shop.Instead of a T-Rex. I got a brontosaurus with a long thin neck that looks like it would be easy to chew off.  My dog doesn't care what dino he got. But the Rex shape looks a lot more durable."
7,"I love Perky-Pet feeders. but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this. They do not need artificial anything. especially food coloring! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil. and 1 part white sugar. let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this. you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes. and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar. and small insects."
3,"Pat Anjali is the da man of an overview of spiritual practice. from an Indian perspective 600 AD.  (or is that 800 Ad?)The most controversial part of PJ. imo. is he discusses at length the Siddhis or powers accruing from SP.But the definition of SP. according to Pat is in the opening:Yogaham chitta vritti narodaham.Yoga is the stilling of the thought  waves of the mind.orcloseness to God is a result of clearing out childish distractions of the mind.A must have book on every learned person's book shelf. but see another reviewer's comments on the translation - evidently theKindle is crap. or scholarly quality.SO - buy the book. and avoid the Kindle."
9,"This is my first scooter purchase for my oldest daughter (age 6 1/2).  This scooter is built like a tank!  The scooter folds into a very small footprint and is easily assembled via lever.  The welds appear and feel solid and the material used is clearly first grade.  This scooter can easily be handed down (might need wheel replacements from normal use).It is somewhat refreshing to see a well made product in this category.  I have seen many of the neighbors children using other brand scooters and they simply do not compare.  I will warn you though. this scooter is not as light (in weight) as you would think.  I was a little surprised.  However. the grade of material used clearly contributes to the weight."
12,"This game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo. They have other games. they rent other games. but they keep coming back to this one.They like the two player option. They like the challenge  (they're not teens yet). They like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games. They like being able to set their and the opponent's  skill levels. They just love this game!I personally wish it were a  little less violent. but compared to other games out there. this is a  teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of. buy this  game."
7,"This cordless trimmer has plenty of power and makes short work of bushes and shrubs around my house.  Uses the same 18V battery as my B&D; drill. so it's nice to have a spare if I need it.  First time I used it. I went out planning to spend 5 minutes or so trying it out.  Instead. I was outside over 45 minutes and got most of my trimming done.  I've never used a corded trimmer. but I can imagine how much trouble it would be to deal with the cord.  This is quick and easy.I think the main thing about a battery operated hedge trimmer is that you need to take care of the battery.  Keep the battery in a moderate temperature environment (don't leave it in your freezing garage or storage building). and keep it charged.  If the trimmer doesn't run for long right out of the box. you probably have a defective battery."
12,"I loved the game the first time i played it through. but as with MOST (not all) games. it got boring the second time around...:(...It strays far from the movie. It has the basic characters. but is not like the movie. You will recognize a few items and place from the movie...like the palace. of the last part of the game. where you defeat Darth Maul. but it was just kind of a game to sell and make money...It's fun. but doesn't lastJason Anderson"
4,"Mel Gibson. the man behind those lame 'Lethal Weapon' sagas has created one of the best films ever made.  A film that will be his legacy. for I believe it will long be remembered after he is gone.  At first I was put off by this film.  I absolutely hate subtitles. but honestly spoken english would have destroyed the integrity of this film.It is beautifully filmed.  Lavish in splendor. harsh in brutality. but honest in its intentions.  Gibson is a master director.  He created a wide range of emotions for his audience to experience.  The performances are top notch.  I have never seen acting so real. so emotional.  If anyone can see this movie and not be touched. they are heartless.  When I saw it in the theater and showed this film at my house with some friends. there was not a dry eye in the house.  This is a masterpiece!"
7,"I've had 2 of these now for 3 years and they work really well.  The range is not quite 41 feet. but that's probably due to my water pressure. i'd say its closer to 30 at most.  another impact sprinkler i have goes a few feet further. but it's not the biggest deal.  The positives about this are that it's very solid- i've never had a problem with it not operating properly. and it seems to spray the area very effectively. Considering that they're going on 3 years now. i'd buy them all over again with no hesitation."
4,"A brilliant mock-documentary on the life of a criminal - played byAllen - with some of the funniest lines and sight gags I've ever seenin a film. It's important to remember that 'mockumentaries' weren'tcommon when Allen made this. and it was actually seen as quiteexperimental in it's own crazy. low budget way.This isn't the deep. brilliant film-maker of 'Annie Hall'. etc. but anamazingly smart and funny young Allen capturing the spirit of cinemaanarchists like the Marx Brothers.The only small drawbacks; a sometimes cloying musical score and acouple of slow sections around the love story. But these are very smallflies in the great ointment.The movie is brilliant enough that seeing it in full frame instead of the original 1:66isn't so awful. (The difference between 1:33 and 1:66 isn't huge). but if you're apurist (or obsessive) like me. you might opt for the out of print. but stilloften available used Anchor Bay version. which is in the correct ratio."
4,"We love this DVD.  My son enjoys and asks for it frequently.  Highly recommend...my son loves to count things now!HOWEVER. I do have just one small complaint.  The 'chapters' are not clean...if you go to the chapter on the number 3 you get the tail end of 2; chapter 5 closes with the beginning of the next number.  This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?  It doesn't seem like rocket science to me..."
7,"The birds don't like it at all....I saw about four just sit at the feeder and try to figure out what they were supposed to do.  I think one of the birds actually flipped me off for getting this.  If you don't tighten the lid and bottom secure enough the bird seed will spill ALL over your floor. and it's amazing how quickly a full bird feeder will empty on the ground.  I would have to say that I can't see how a squirrel would get to the food...I will say that about it.  But what good is it if the birds don't get to it either?  I'll probably go back to one of the others and just feed the squirrels with the birds."
10,"I won't bore you with repeating the specs or features of the biscuit joiner as the other reviews cover them quite well. I've had this tool for about 6 months now and am delighted with it. I had the porter cable model which is quite a bit more expensive. I found it to be bulkier to use than the DeWalt and a lot more likely to slip away from your alignment marks than the DeWalt. This cutter has pins on both sides of the blade that go a long way to help keeping the cutter in line with the wood.. The only drawback is that the dust chute will clog with the dust bag installed when cutting into long grained softwoods.Having owned both the porter cable and the Dewalt I must give a big nod to the DeWALT. Smaller and easier to use and a few $$ less."
3,"I've been reading USA Today for over 5 years. I love the content. the features. the pictures. It's my favorite newspaper.Trying out the Kindle version. you get the articles but sometimes they're not formatted correctly. I did notice some black and white photos. Even if they had the photos that accompany the article in black and white that would be good.I tried it for a week while on vacation. I was able to keep up to date with the news but after that week. I decided to cancel it. I can't see myself canceling my print edition to read it on  Kindle.Hopefully. they'll improve it in the future. But now. just try it out for free to see for yourself."
12,"This. for me. was truly a wonderful experience. I've played this game countless times. yet over and over I find myself wondering why. When I first played this game. I had no idea I was immersing myself into the abstract but gorgeous world of Final Fantasy VII. You are the hero. of course. and you're out to save the world. one step at a time. And really. that's exactly what you do in FFVII. In classic Final Fantasy style. the seventh game in the series brings Cloud. a mercenary now working for a terrorist group. into your head. As you play. you can really understand where the characters come from and what their real selves are like. It might sound weird. but this is truly an incredible game. A wonderful experience for anyone who likes this series. or anyone looking for an absolutely outstanding story."
2,"This Product turned out to be what I expected based on other's reviews.but it does what it says if you follow the directions carefully.The only thing is that it does not get the ice cream to a solid texture.like soft serve as other's have said.so you can freeze it more within a few hours if preferred as I did.It is slightly noisy but it does not bother me.sound can be compared to a blow dryer on low perhaps but not exact.Other than that minor issue it works pretty good and I intend to use it plenty.also I was glad to purchase it in my favorite color red."
12,"Words really can describe how wonderful this game is. The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics (note: a 3D card is not required!.) Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions (who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions.) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics. it makes this a very absorbing adventure. This is one of the few games that I can't say anything negative about. This is a must have!"
10,"Solid construction. comfortable fit. Like all Makita tools I've bought. it has lived up to high expectations. Beyond wood I've sanded down lots of metal -- an old file cabinet. a credenza -- from its 30 year old enameled  surface down to brushed metal (also primed it with some paint remover). I  agree that the dust collection is useless. but this is true with most tools  not hooked up to a vacuum system.Lastly. a hand orbital is never going  to give you the removing power of a belt sander. It is meant for finer  applications and if you have to take off lots of rough surfaces. you'll be  frustrated by the lack of power. At the same time a belt sander will erase  twice the surface that you intend. If you've never used power sanders  before. I'd recommend borrowing or renting one first to figure out which  type you'll use most frequently."
5,"Hey jerks. do you play guitar?  Well. if you do. you need strings.  Well. you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar.  If so. you can stop reading.  If you use strings. you should buy them your damn self.  While you're at it. buy ten sets.  Seriously. are you a child?  Always have extra strings.  D'Addarios last a long time for me. and they sound good.  Also. they're on the bottom end of the price range.  Buy some strings. douchnozzle."
9,"I ordered this 29.5' basketball with the only intention of playing with my young son. Having said that. I was not too worried about getting a more professional ball.For starters I could not play with it out of the package as it did not have enough air in it. so we had to wait until I could have it inflated (unfortunately I do not have the needed tools at home) The ball looks really cool. it is light and has a nice grip.We have had it for a little over a week and we like it so far. again. I am not playing professionally or anything like that. it is a basket ball I am using to teach my young son how to play so. works great for me!"
2,"This is an ok book for a new cake decorator. It recovers a lot of the stuff already covered in the instruction booklets (beginning cake decorating and flowers and borders) and gives some full cake ideas.I like the instructions and have been using them as a supplement to the instruction books to have ideas of decorations to practice. However. the cakes themselves are nothing super exciting.This is the sort of book you buy when you're starting out and use until you have the skills down pretty well - then you would probably never use it again. I just can't see myself pulling this book out for 'cake decorating ideas' when there are so many better idea books out there.Honestly. if you weren't getting this on a 4-for-3 promotion or it was on sale for about 10 bucks I wouldn't bother with it."
2,"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the 'preservatives' in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half. it was amazing!As for the noise it makes. I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room. closing the door and setting a time. lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year."
4,"I have a lot of fun with this video. I will admit. like a lot of other workouts. it takes some getting used to. I had to do this three times before I learned all the routines. There are very few workouts that I can pick up on the first try.Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke take you through every move and I don't think they are too fast to keep up with.  They stress to go at your own pace. anyway.  (Taebo is just too fast for me)The first time I used this video. my back muscles were a little sore. I also lift light weights (Kathy Smith's weight training of course). so I am used to using my back and arm muscles.I like this video much more than her 'Aerobox Workout'."
9,"Strong. reliable lock.  Shank is long enough to make it useful in securing trigger of rifle with trigger guard molded into synthetic stock. involving complex curves in three dimensions. of all weather Benjamin Trail.  No keys to add to already overworked keyring.Would have preferred a four digit combination and high contrast numerals.  Seems to me likely to be stronger and more secure than a Frantzen combination trigger lock with a different locking mechanism I have on another gun. but I find the Frantzen easier to read and work with."
7,"Bought this in the summer (much cheaper then) and put it out about 2 months ago.  We have our own 'homemade' fountain which consists of a large pot that holds about 10 gallons of water and a shallow dish on top.This product is able to keep the water liquid. combined with the moving water from the fountain.  Night time temps have averaging about 15 F.  The birds have been flocking to it.The cord is very. very short. about a foot long.  That is one drawback because you will need an outdoor extension cord. It is sturdy and does not get too warm.  You can easily pick it up with your bare hands when it is running.Did not notice the impact on the electric bill."
4,"Of all the movies i've seen about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Christ. this movie has the most accurate portrayal as I've seen so far even though in the bible Jesus had suffered a far more gruesome beatings than what was shown in film but it's as close as it gets. The movie also has the characters speaking in hebrew instead of english unlike other films about the crucifixion. However I suggest that people watch this film with caution. it shows alot of graphic stuff including blood and it's definately not for younger children.  It's a great film overall."
12,"This game is awesome. it is better then black except for the graphics. sound and story. But. gameplaywise. this game excels!Innocent pedestrians. secret goodies. destorying the eiphel tower. while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious. but on 2p. HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times. but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics. and some better storyline. this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good]. get tw1 or tw black instead."
4,"I cannot recommend this product enough.  There are so many things to say...it improves your sex life tremendously!  It helps incontinence!  And if you have organ prolapse and are scared that surgery is your only choice...THIS DVD IS FOR YOU!  I suffered for many months with a prolapse and was terrified of having surgery (have you seen all the commercials for attorneys suing for that very surgery?!).  With regular use I've been able to stave off the prolapse!  And my sex life has been so greatly improved because I'm not longer uncomfortable or in pain!  Don't hesitate!  HabIt is worth every penny!!"
7,"These are perfect kabob skewers.  Very sturdy. sharp point to get through food. wide flat edge so the food doesn't spin around when you are flipping them as it invariably does with round skewers.  More expensive than bamboo skewers but unless you lose these. they should last forever.  Pay attention to the measurements as these bad boys are long.  I have a WSM 22.5 inch and 22 inch Performer and these fit but not on my 18 One Touch Silver or the little Smokey Joe.  If you have a small grill these may not work.  Otherwise. they are perfect."
2,"I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming. A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s. That one lasted around 12 years(!!!) I just burned-out my second one: and now I'm here to buy my third! It's very easy to operate. even for a quad!!It really works fast and the processing mechanism is made well. I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds. and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy."
7,"I setup bins and a tumbler to compost this year.  Our city recently changed the trash system and I'm growing a vegetable garden so it just made sense to compost much of what would otherwise be thrown out.I've started using this in my compost bins along with kitchen scraps. brown and green matter.  It seems to be speeding up the process. but it's hard to say how much difference it makes.Next I'll try it in one of the two holding bins I have for dry leaves to see how much of a difference it makes.Glad to have a chance to try out this product.  If it speeds up the process. I'll be purchasing more."
2,"This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time. When the bag gets full. pop out that one and replace it with a new one. My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug. No. it's not great on the rug. But the floors with dog and cat hair. dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time. Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture. dog pillows. and even the cob webs that appear now and again. This was a marginally careful purchase. My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years. the previous one for eight. Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me."
2,"I absolutely love this corer! It's incredibly easy to use. and the best part is that it doesn't seem to have any sharp edges I can cut myself on. Clutz-approved! Despite lacking sharp edges. it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force. OXO handles are great. as I have quite a few of their other products in my kitchen. and this has lived up to it's non-slip standard. If you miss getting all the seeds out the first time. no worries! It comes out as easily as it goes in and and you can try again. Just try not to get too crazy with it. or you'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left!"
5,"Not much to say. these are your basic hex core. nickel plated round wound strings.  They are the equivalent ofErnie Ball Slinkys (Yellow)They play nice. and feel pretty much the same in my humble (non-touring musician's) opinion.Also. it's nice that strings are now coming in air tight packaging to keep the fresher and rust free longer.  As a note these come packed together in a single bag. with color coded washers. (as opposed to the EB sets that are packed individually in paper sleeves or DR sets that come two to a sleeve.)In summary. if you're searching for the subtle sonic differences between the brands then you probably aren't reading this review. you're out experimenting.  For others. the lowdown is that these seem like good strings and are definitely worth checking out to see which ones you prefer more."
9,"I thought I could get away with my standard seat on the new bicycle I got.  It seemed pretty comfortable on my quick ride around the neighborhood.  But after I installed this. I rode 4x around the neighborhood without feeling a thing.  It doesn't seem like it would do much when you put it on. but I have to say it has made my ride feel like air.  It feels like I am just riding on my peddles and frame.  I can't recommend the gel seat enough.  This one fit my bike very well and for a great price.  Highly recommend it!"
4,"I have never had so much fun with an exercise video until I did the 'Latin Workout'. I was very impressed with Kathy and her assistants. The music was marvelous and very authentic. I love Afro-Cuban music. I really worked up a sweat. You can get a lot out of this video when you put more effort into the moves. This video is so enjoyable the time just flies by. I really had to get used to moving my hips. It felt so dirty but in a nice and sexy sort of way. I can exercise to this video everyday. So if anyone is considering starting an exercise program with a lot of fun. start off with this video."
12,"Street fighter alpha 3 might be the best street fighter out there to date. It has awesome game modes cool levels and best of all its the never ending fun of a 2d fighter. The graphics are what you would expect froma 3d fighter a little choppy and an occasional glitch or two or maybe an occasional mergence of fighters but all in all its one of my favorite game out there. Ihave been an avis street fighter fan all the way back to the SNES version of street fighter 2 turbo! i would encourage anybody to get street fighter alpha 3 because its fun and hey its down to 20 bucks now!"
7,"We've been inundated by squirrels raiding (taking over) our platform birdfeeder that came with our country home.  After extensive searching and reading of consumer reviews. we decided on the Heritage Farms bird feeder.  It looked extremely durable and it holds a lot of seed.  The perches are weight adjustable so you can exclude blue jays or pigeons from eating the seed if you want.  I had the feeder set up in no time and it took about 1 hour before the first bird lighted on it and started eating.  Soon. the word was out and several birds were enjoying the seed.  We look forward to many years of enjoyment - it's built like a 50's metal toy truck. if you're old enough to remember!!"
5,"The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didn't make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They don't cut the string they shear it off. I've done 3 sets of strings and no noticable wear on the cutter."
9,"This is a wonderful ball.  I know because we bought the first one over a year ago for my son's birthday.  We bought one similar maybe the exact one before but he didn't write his name on it and it never came back home after a practice.  It has a nice 'sticky' grip. feels secure when grasp. and for preparing to shoot. It holds air well and doesn't need to be re-inflated except maybe check it at the start of the season.  Has a nice vibrant feel to the bounce and is all that you'd expect in a quality ball.  I highly recommend it to all. It even arrives inflated for immediate play."
10,"This is a dead-on accurate piece of art right out of the box. I use it in shop for many fine furniture cuts that need to be tuxedo accurate instead of using my radial arm saw. In the rough construction field. it works all day long on a small honda (2000) generator with no complaints. If you knock it out of alignment from roughing it up too much in the field (all saws will suffer from this fate.) just take the time to square it up. and you're good to go again! I have found absolutely no issues with this product"
3,"I wish I could give half stars. If so. I would give this 3 1/2 stars. but I can't so I will be nice and give it 4. It's not a bad book for the price (I got mine for $0.99). I will say that the editing was simply atrocious. but if you can get around that. it is a quick read. The characters are likeable and the story moves along pretty quickly. However. there were a few parts that I felt were too contrived and not overly believable to actually happen in real life. BUT. the love scenes were HOT and steamy. very well done. I finished this in a day. so go ahead and read this if you are a fan of the author (which I am) and are interested in escaping reality for a few hours."
9,"First. let me tell you that I have not yet ordered the larger size bottle from Amazon. but sure will! I wanted to try it first by getting the smallest bottle from Kroger to see how I liked it.I started by filling up my hand soap dispensers and then showering with it and I really like it! My skin feels so light and clean and not dry at all.I have not shampooed with it (a little scared to although I don't know why?); nor have I cleaned with it yet. For cleaning. I only use a vinegar/water spray and I'm happy with that.The peppermint is invigorating and fun but a friend of mine tells me I might like some of the other fragrances better. I would love to try them all!Once I have tried other things. I might update my review to 5 stars but didn't think it was quite honest or fair to do so yet.You'll be glad you made the switch!"
8,"This cat food contains a lower level of magnesium than the 'supermarket' cat foods. Low magnesium levels help to prevent urethra problems. especially in male cats due to their more narrow urethra. I would rather pay the higher price for this brand of cat food than bring my cats to an emergency vet in the middle of the night because their urinary tract gets blocked. not to mention the aggravation caused to the cat. Other brands of low magnesium cat food include Iam's and Nutro-Max. Hill's Science Diet food is round-shaped. rather than 'hooked'. which makes it easier for one of my older tooth-challenged cats to swallow."
9,"[update 10/24/2008]  My daughter is now four - we still use the trailer for long rides and she still loves it.  The construction of the unit is decent and has held up well.----The trailer is really easy to set up - five minutes if you have a quick release for the back wheel of the host bike.  The ride is pleasant (meaning very smooth) for both the parent and child.  Like others have mentioned. the toddler loves their personal space.  Plenty of 'whees' when we coast down hills.I envision after my toddler out grows the trailer that I can use it for running errands.This is a non-brainer purchase."
2,"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.  Like other reviewers said. this does NOT create steam. but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it &quot;Steamvac&quot;).It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch.  There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank. which proves that it does suction.  Many small cleaners like this spray solution on. but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud. considering it is a vacuum.  It is very light and easy to carry.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.  Of course. I knew this when I bought it. but it would've been a nice feature."
5,"Simple. compact. well constructed. easy to use. and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo. designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make. each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar. Heritage Cherry Sunburst). aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar. Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge. andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar. Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck. it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock. Not a huge deal. but a consideration."
9,"I guess goggles is one of those things that either works for you or it doesn't. Most of Speedo's goggles have great reviews so I wasn't sure which ones would work for me. Ordered the oversized Baja model which wasn't up to the mark for me because it hurt after wearing it for some time. Replaced them with these Hydrospex goggles and these are PERFECT! Very comfortable to wear. keep the water out completely. do not get foggy (I ordered the black ones). and do not hurt at all."
7,"I have a four year German Shepherd and during the summer months the flies tend to munch on the tips of his ears. I have tries all types of all natural insect repellents. none of which ever worked. I also tried flys off which was fair but not 100%. not even 50% effective. So I decided to eliminate the flies to eliminate the problem. I then searched Amazon. my go to company for everything and I discovered the fly trap. I was skeptical at first but I opened the top and filled with water ad directed and hung it near my dogs house. Within hours I saw many flies trapped and within a few days the number of flies in the area has decreased tremendously. I will buy more fly traps and if you have a problem with flys. you should too."
7,"This tool makes unpleasant pruning tasks much more pleasant and the ease of cutting makes the work a lot more pleasant!  (If you can bear to think of it that way!)  It really takes the effort out of cutting thick branches.  I carry this lopper along with my smaller pruner--and I don't struggle trying to use the pruner on bush that's too thick for it.  Makes the whole pruning job go faster.I use this on our numerous rose bushes. too.  The length comes in real handy when I'm trying to avoid the thorns.In our neck-of-the-woods. we'll be pruning our roses in mid-February.  So now is not too early to start thinking about Spring-time gardening chores."
2,"This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.  Its black. rubberized grip has a section of 'gills' that molds to your grip for better control.  When you're done. just pop it in the dishwasher.  The only drawback is that with long term use. the 'gills' sometimes break off.  It took years for that to happen to mine (only one section).This is hardly an elegant device. but it works well and is perfect for everyday and outdoor use.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
3,"The book. originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic. reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published. especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic. it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However. I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created.  The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted. but it DOES have photographs. The decision. therefore. is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos. while not spectacular. greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition."
10,"I bought one of these for light duty planing tasks - relieving corners. cutting dowels flush and etc.  You do have to hone the pre-ground edge  before you use it the first time.  It is ground to 25 degrees and  recommended final angle is 30 after honing.  I used a Veritas honing guide  and a Japanese water stone to do the job.  It only took about 5 minutes  with the right tools!The mouth is easily adjustable with the front knob  to regulate the size of your curls.  The blade is easy to adjust with the  brass knob at the back.  It is easy to grip and use.  I look forward to  getting may years of use out of this well made tool!"
7,"We have an open air compost pile that has both yard and kitchen waste. After putting a fresh batch of veggie scraps and egg shells on the pile. I poured the recommended amount of Ringer 3050 Compost Plus 2 over the pile and watered as directed.  A week later I checked the pile and the kitchen waste was already unrecognizable. The Ringer 3050 Composte Plus 2 was doing a nice job of helping the scraps and shells break down.Can't wait till the compost is ready in a couple of months to use in my garden."
5,"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name. but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product. but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret. my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me. my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too..."
9,"I got one of this knife as free item from Swiss army gift pack. I gave it to my 10 years old daughter who is a town boy loves it. It's very easy for her to use and carry it with her. Most likely she use it for craft work. Then she wants her friends to have it. so I bought all different colors for other daughters as birthday gift. even very girlish girl (she got pink one) likes the knife too. It's a very cute and excellent tool."
2,"Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.  Bought one two days ago and bought a load of milk and supplies cause figured it would take 5 or 6 times to get it right.  have made 4 ice creams already.  So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.  used mostly the recipes that came with the machine except that being lactose intolerant. i used lactaid milk and also used baking splenda instead of sugar.  It worked out fine. But. i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.  and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.  We are real happy with this for sure."
8,"I have 3 spoiled dogs.  Puperoni was the only pricey soft treat they'd eat.  Then I tried beef Zukes as something cheaper and different.  They smell awful to me. but the dogs all grabbed these little squares and gobbled them up....to my surprise.  I then bought the Chicken Zuke's. which they rejected.  So It's back to the beef recipe.  Since all my dogs are older. I figured that the extra benifit of 'hip action' would be a good thing"
3,"Disclaimer: I got this for my Kindle when it was being given away for free.  It now is up to $2.80 but my review takes into account what I paid.I like Markhat the finder. a hard-boiled ex-military gumshoe in a fantasy land where trolls. vampires. and other creatures of the night interact with humans.  This novella/short story has some great dialog and I truly wish it had been longer.  I even paid $2.00 for another Markhat book. The Mister Trophy. hoping for more of the same and while it was equally as good as this book it was also equally as short.  If I consider the combined content of both books and consider the $2 I paid for them. I still rate them 5 stars.Apparently there is a third. longer Markhat book out now which for some reason isn't available for the Kindle.  Come on Frank. what are you and Samhain waiting for?"
4,"I don't know what I felt.  I was both overwhelmed by the movie's violence as well as saddened.  So I suppose Mel Gibson may have served his purpose.  The movie was incredibly violent.  You have no choice but to pity and admire a man who would not strike back from being beaten to death.However. I would have been more interested in seeing the teachings of Jesus and his influence on his followers.  This would have best depicted the Passion of Christ.  How he lived would have been more inspirational than how he died.  It's his teachings that are remembered and taught through the ages.  But I suppose Mel Gibson wants his film to be different from all the other films about Christ.I love the historical accuracy and the use of the Latin and Aramaic.  The acting was superb.  Imagine learning to speak and ACT in a tongue that no longer is used.All in all. the film deserves some sort of oscar."
9,"I like to have this small one in my pocket for daily use.  It's small enough so it is less bulky than my car key and alarm bob.  It has the basic knife. combination screwdriver and nail file. and a small scissor; everything I've needed in a pinch when at work or out-and-about.  There's a pull out tweezer and toothpick. but I rarely use those.  Unfortunately. I had to give my last one to TSA at the airport.  I've gotten so used to slipping it into my pocket. it's hard to purposely not take it along."
8,"I have 2 cats and one is getting chubby. plus I'm tired of always feeding them regularly.  I needed this for when I was out of town anyway. This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them. I don't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site. Besides. it's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom---a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that."
3,"I wasn't sure to expect when I ordered this book. I've heard great reviews. but sometimes when I get around to reading the book. it just doesn't live up to the hype. Not so in this case.I sincerely enjoyed this tale of the young. innocent Oliver Twist and his story of misfortune. While the novel was darker and more violent than I'd at first anticipated. the language flows like poetry. I loved the roller coaster ride Dickens takes us on as Oliver searches to escape the evils forced upon him. only to be pulled back in. The build to the climax of the story was expertly formulated and executed.Oliver Twist is a classic in the true sense of the word. If you've not had the pleasure of reading this novel. don't delay. Order it today."
9,"Lets face it. its not worth putting an expensive scope on a .22 rifle.  I put this on my Remington 597 plinker rifle and it works great.  I shot a few hundred rounds this last weekend at 50 yards and had no problems with the scope.  For [...] bucks. its a steal!  The scope is built well and comes with a wrench for the scope rings.  The scope is easy to sight in as well.  You can't really use your fingers. but you can use a spent casing or coin to turn it."
5,"I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff.I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so.It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as 'black' as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings.They also seem to have more 'string squeak' when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that 'vintage tone' but they do sound decent.However. for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings (.009-.042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings. Super Light. 9-42.EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me. but I am a Da-Dairy-O man. for now."
3,"As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble. this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south.  The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea (no artificial ingredients allowed).  As this reviewer read two to three tales a night. the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life.  That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience.  Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time. (Mike Roberts) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner"
9,"Aerobie rings are awesome as for distance. though you have to have good control.  Otherwise. you may find it leaves your neighborhood.It's good for kids when learning. because it will still fly if they flub the toss.They don't hold up to UV and weather really well.  A year in the backyard and the plastic is faded and brittle.  YMMV. but it should last a long time if you bring it in when you're done with it.Be advised that while the image shows a three-pack. you get only one.  They're a little pricey. but not too bad if you're expecting it."
9,"I cannot recommend this grill/griddle enough. since it is so versatile and easy to use and clean.  It makes a whole breakfast from bacon and eggs and pancakes. Flip it over and it is an excellent grill for meats and fish.  And it works well on gas and charcoal cook surfaces as well as electric.  I has a gas stove and am always in awe whenever I use it since it makes cooking so much fun.  And the price is excellent.  I have scads of cast iron from this grill/griddle. to fry pans of all sizes. and cornbread pans and other items.  Stuff never wears out and gets handed down generation to generation."
2,"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.  Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.  What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating. & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.  I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.  This one is so much quieter. too.  Tonight. I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.  You can't beat that.  The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.  I should have bought this years ago."
9,"I purchased the clear model before and I loved it. I like the tinted lens look and the darker color of these. Soon as they came in I hit the gym pool. They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right.  They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad. The fit around the eyes is very comfortable. Like I say about all my swimming gear make sure you wash it off before you put it away."
8,"I recently got a puppy who is chewing on everything. except most of the puppy toys.  This is one of the exceptions.  He loves it.  His two favorite things are his Mr. Bill doll and his bully stick.  Both of them are holding up well.  If I activate the &#34;Oh. noooooo&#34; sound. he pounces on it and jumps around.  If he activates it in his mouth. he does a demonstration of the shaken baby syndrome and runs around the house.  I am amazed at the abuse this toy has taken.  If he ever destroys it. I will be getting him another.  As to the reviewer who bought it for his brother. not realizing it was a dog toy. I am sure any fan of Mr. Bill (and maybe even those who have never heard of Mr. Bill) would love to have this doll."
8,"This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy's teething phase. The rest are history. I have a female lab retriever. and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt. She doesn't chew on it hard enough to break it. but you can tell it's losing its texture. I think it's a great toy that will last a long time =)UPDATE 3/17/2014: This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever! It's losing its texture (from all the biting) but it hasnt been broken :) Very recommended!"
10,"I have had this Jig Saw for Almost 3 years now.  I don't use it daily. but it does get more than its fair share of abuse.  To this day. any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job.  Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project.  When I first used the saw. I was using an all purpose blade to do everything.  After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock. I learned just how much difference they make.For me. this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond.  It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."
5,"I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well. I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also. you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little 'comb' that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me. and the Vox is very good. I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby."
2,"I like this item.  It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them. The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.  When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer. If it could go out the side as you rice them. it wouldn't do that. And to be perfectly honest. it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes. They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them. So. if you hate peeling potatoes. you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them. However. because some of the potato gets pushed up over the top during the ricing. you can get a few pieces of peel in your potatoes that way."
8,"This is in no way a Giant cat litter pan. lol. I ordered it based on the description that it was larger than large-that it was giant. I have a cat on the larger side and thought this would be bigger than the large pans found in pet stores.It's not.I ordered a large cat litter pan from amazon for $5.99 that is larger than this one.The pan is of nice quality though. I think it would be perfect for a medium sized kitty.I'll be returning this. False advertising is a pet peeve."
7,"We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works."
3,"I was very pleased that Mr. Attebery made me work a little to get to know the characters.  He didn't just hand you a set of characteristics and then expect you to just follow the action.  He ensured that his characters had solid personalities and that the evolved throughout the book.  A well crafted story with a tragic hero.  You just don't see too many like this anymore.I certainly prefer this type of story because it develops along the classic format of story telling.  This book was not written with a screen play in mind.  It was written with a desire to tell story and thoroughly engage the reader.Very enjoyable and satisfying. not like the junk food. slap-dash novels you see so much of these days."
5,"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it. a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable. there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft"
8,"At first it looked like it was going to work great (when the litter was clean). After a day or so. it wasn't cleaning very well. I got better litter and it started working better. but still not great. Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake. After about two weeks of use. the rake stopped moving backwards. I tried to fix it. but it just won't go in reverse. Overall. this was a big waste of time and money. I'm not even going to try to get another one. A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean. It's too bad as it had a promising beginning. DO NOT BUY."
9,"I wish they had the attachment to use different socket tips. FIrst day I took it up into the Alpine regieon of the Rocky MOuntains. BAMB! I cut my thumb on the blade!  Old EMT trainng came into effect ... hehe.  I will comment later when I use it more. I bought this to see how will the saw blades will work for carving/sawing wooden triggers for snares and dead falls. Not sure this device will be up to it.It's slick and easy to keep clean.  The pouch is nice and I wear it when I go out of the house I do have confidence it will come in handy for several years.UPDATE:After 3 months I bought another as my son wanted a version of a Leatherman ... so I bought him this one. Be careful ... I cut myself again!"
12,"Though I didn't think it would be possible without adding real pictures. the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst. Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine  used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst. but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea. Ultimately. all these things add up to tougher game play. but this game is well worth it."
2,"I suddenly had a need for more paring knives so I decided to buy four various models on Amazon to try them out.  This is by far my favorite.  They are extremely sharp and the rubberized grip is very comfortable.  When I reach into my drawer I tend to want to grab this knife over the others but have to tell myself to rotate through all of them.  I've had it for over three months now with use almost every three days and so far no sign of any type of oxidation or staining.  I wash it in a dishwasher all the time as well."
2,"I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.  I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto. missed it and decided to get another one.  The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.  This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.  The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.  It seems to be pretty stout overall.  I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks."
12,"Made in 98. but still better quality. play. and design than most games on the market in '05.  Good storyline. great AI and graphics. not-overly aggressive system requirments. tons of add-ons available.  Incredible single player mode. good weapon selection. and arguably one of the best FPS online games of all time.  If you like HALO. you will like Halflife.  Very similar. but no limit on how many weapons you can carry. and the levels aren't as repetative.  (My biggest complaint about Halo. though it's obvious why. many of the levels and hallways are exact copies of one you've seen dozens of times already...gives a feeling of being lost. and even fed up at times.) Halo does have the edge as far as cars and what not though. I also recommend Halflife 2. the sequel to what I'm talkin about here...  INSANE graphics and gameplay."
10,"Great instructions allow this stand to be put together with few tools and frustration in a short time.  The ability to assemble the stand with a built in tilt is great for clearing chips from the saw by gravity as it is in operation.  They even supply a few extra pieces of the assembly nuts and bolts in case you loose one of the small easy to loose parts.  Far better than having one or two short and not being able to finish the assembly with out a trip to the local hardware store.  The tripod design insures all feet will remain flat on the floor at all times.  Not too wide so it takes up little floor space in a smaller shop.  Light weight and strong. it serves well."
8,"We have been using this for less then a week and our 14 year old Pit Bull X is running around like a 9 year old!!! She had been starting to make ALLOT of cracking noises while stretching. especially in her neck and we noticed her slowing down.  Within 2 days the cracking sound is gone and she is able to go for family walks again and keep up with her 4 year old Catahoula brother.  Added bonus is that she LOVES the taste of the gravy that you get when you add water to the powder... I can't recommend this product enough and will be ordering the 20 lb once the 5 lb container is finished."
2,"I LOVE OXO products. I think they are some of the best designed kitchen tools on the market. I started using OXO knives when I found a 6&quot; utility knife. That is a great knife. OXO makes many other great/good knives but this one is not worth the money. I was very excided to use it for the first time and when I did I noticed that the blade was flimsy. it was more like cutting with a sharp piece of sheet metal rather than using a sturdy knife. I would recommend spending a little more and getting a better knife."
9,"I have owned a Stanley thermos for years and they were built like a tank and made in the USA. I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is. While it may look like the old American made Stanley. it is just a veneer of it's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk. I would rather they go out of business than ruin their good reputation. Don't waste your money as the companies soul died some time ago."
7,"I have used this twice now.  Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs.  It worked great both times. but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs.  This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better.  The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it.  But this was a minor issue.  Overall the unit worked great."
9,"We have three of these. one for each kid. They have been well used by all three children and have held up well to the use. They fold down to a very slim size that fits well under our seats or in our trunk. We have had them for some time and the children are able to fold them up and open them up without extra help from mom and dad (always a plus).The one negative that I have found is that if you get the lever that is used to lock the scooter open (or closed) at all dirty it will jam and not open or shut very easily. A quick clean will fix this. but it is something to watch for.A small adult can easily use this with no difficulties. If you are a heavier adult or tall. you might want to look for a sturdier scooter meant to hold adults.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
10,"I bought this for a one person shop.  My original intent was to have one hose and pull it to the tool I was using.1st. If you plan to use cheaper hose in a one tool per time system. the fact that the in-feed is on top of the unit. the weight of the hose will crimp thinner hoses.2nd. this sucker does not roll for beans. it has 4 wheels two are fixed and to rotate. if you happen to be pulling in the direction that the rear wheels are pointing (Rarely are you pulling to where you already are) you're good. if not your in trouble.I ran a more permanent system and with blast gates it has plenty of power to run jointers. planers router tables.  Just myobservations."
12,"Played it for the first time. after it has been out for over ten years.  Great game.  The puzzles are hard. but not impossible to solve.  If you truly love Myst. then you will certainly love this game.  (Do not use walkthroughs. it ruins the game!)  Also. keep in mind that the 5-CD Riven set is for outdated computers.  It will most likely not run on Vista or XP. at least not without some major glitches.  Wish I had played this sooner."
12,"All in all. this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time. Of course. it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female. evil castle. jump on enemies. etc. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that. occasionally. it works really well. Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection. Although we question Nintendo's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president. they did so for a good cause. and a damn good game."
2,"This is not able to go in front of my window. as the window I use it in is a double. However. I popped the screen out. and this fan fits perfect. When you go outside. and stand in front of it. you KNOW it sucking a TON of air through the house! It's a lot of wind! I'm considering getting another. but I honestly think one may fine for my 1500sf house. I make sure at least three windows are opened. and it works great. I've used the reversible feature a couple times. and I'm glad it's there. but mostly it's on high and exhaust. Hope this review helps. I LOVE this fan."
9,"Bought the pink one for dd so she could have a scooter like her brothers.She gets around on that thing too fast i think lol.What can i say it is a Razor they are the best. We have a few other brands and they are not as easy to close up and store as the Razors are.Great scooter and super way for them to get good exercise and just enjoy being a kid! Too bad i never had one growing up oh wait that is ok because honestly i use theirs sometimes lol!"
10,"If you get this on sale its not a bad kit.  I have used the bisket tip and found that helpfull and I like the roller a lot.  You only have so much working time and the faster you can get the glue where you want it the better.  Also you want full coverage but as little squeeze out as possible.  Any glue smeared on the wood and your stains wont take.  This kit would be better with about three bottles because you usually need more than one tip at a time (or tips and the roller).  Most of the tips are for wooden dowels. I could have used a few less of those."
12,"This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention. but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear. you actually loose points by being spotted. even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score. or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans."
4,"It was a bummer finding myself looking at subtitles.  I also did not experience in the fervent passion and zeal that the movie was supposedly causing.I think the hype is a bit much for the product.I'd advise you not to have 'treats' or a meal as you watch this movie.  We need to remember that Caligula was mad for eating and watching gore at the same time.  This movie is pure ancient Roman gore.  This can't be too far of a cry from what Caligula enjoyed watching as he sat in his personal home eating and munching.A decent parent would never allow their child to see this movie.  It is the stuff Caligula had watched as a child and we know how he turned out.  It's unnerving to think of how many 'Boots' sat out in those movie theaters. and how many are now sitting in the livingroom with  'mummsy and dahdah.' I mean we're talking graphic angles of torture devices on the skin as never before seen etc."
8,"I have a 2 year old male tabby and a 6 year old female tuxedo cat. Both of them are slightly overweight so I started feeding them this dry cat food a year ago. 4 month ago my male cat developed urinary track blockage (crystal) so we have to keep him on canned food diet. We couldn't be sure the exact cause of the blockage (food. stress. genetic...) My female cat would not eat canned food so we let her keep eating Pro Plan's Weight Management dry food.Now my female cat got urinary track  blockage as well!  I am kicking myself have been keeping her on this dry food.Do not feed your cat this food. Urinary track blockage is very costly to treat. Once they get it. it could be a life long battle. Be carful!"
10,"I purchased this as a first plate jointer to get some experience with how they can be used in my projects.  I haven't experienced the issues with noise that several reviewers have noticed.  Considering many of these jointers can go for double the money. and that my projects are relatively basic. this seemed to be a good match.  I think this is a great unit for beginners or as a backup unit.UPDATE FEBRUARY 2009 - When I bought this unit. I figured it'd be good for maybe a year or two.  Four years out. it continues strong.  It has an annoying tendency for the chip chute to clog up from time to time. which takes a bit of effort to unclog.  But it does great work. and with a little bit of care ensuring your alignment is clean. it works well.  Wish all of my tools were as bulletproof."
10,"It seems that every class of tool has one brand or model that really works just right. Others try to upstage it with different gimmicks. but the obvious best choice keeps coming through. You see it on jobsite after jobsite. P/C routers. Skil wormdrives. Senco finish nailers. Bosch jigsaws...In the 3x21 sander category there is no better tool. Simple. balanced. sturdy  and inexpensive for the long-haul.Square shape and small body mean that one-handed operation (large hand) is practical. allowing for use in ways to which other models don't adapt well.This is my second one in (I don't remember. 15?) years. but a long time anyway. Someone decided they needed my first one more than I did and helped themselves; it'll probably last them forever if they were smart enough to keep it. So I got the latest iteration which is just still the best. I think I paid about the same the first time too."
7,"As a Christmas gift to a friend. I am helping her feed the birds.  She is confined to a wheelchair so watching the birds gives her and her cats a lot of pleasure.  We wanted to draw an assortment of birds. not just sparrows.  This feeder is drawing tit mice. gold finches and a few cardinals but not sparrows.  The squirrels have continued to be thwarted by it and it holds enough feed that I think I can fill it once a week.  We are very pleased with it!"
7,"For every soil sample I tested this powder with. it indicated it was 7.5 ph.  I even tried some of my almost pure peat mix in it and it said it was 7.5. which is the highest the meter will go so I'm assuming it's just bad powder.  I tested the same soil in the other compartment with my liquid ph tester (also bought on here. good stuff). and it showed the real PH values (5.0 for my peat mix). 6.5 for my other regular soil.  So it gets to keep a star because I'll use the container for testing with my liquid ph tester."
10,"I have used my 2 333's for over 2 years.  I have never had a problem with them and have found that they are the most used sanders in my shop.The top palm grip is comfortable. which is important to me as I have smaller sized hands than my fellow woodworkers.  The variable speed adjustment knob is located in an out of the way place. ensuring that you don't accidentally increase the speed while working on your project.The hook and loop setup is very nice.  I have yet to have any problems with any of the hook and loop sandpaper I have used on the two that I own.  None of the paper has ever slid off.I have had a slight problem with one of the dust collectors.  On one of my machines. the collector keeps popping off unless it is secured with masking tape.  Aside from that. the unit collects and pushes dust away properly.  I would still suggest using a mask. however."
8,"I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle.  I thought no way does she tear through this &#34;indestructible&#34; teddy bear.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off... What a joke.  KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage.  I read the reviews and thought &#34;well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog&#34;... NOPE. my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes.  Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys."
2,"There was a review titled &#34;Didn't Fit&#34; which stated:&#34;Be warned! If you are looking for the &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; bag for a Hoover Wind Tunnel vac. don't assume a &#34;Type Z&#34; bag will fit....it won't!&#34;I don't doubt the reviewer got a product which doesn't fit.  Maybe hoover does weird things.  I double checked. and the previous bags I used were &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; - the last one is still in the vacuum.  I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine.  So. I'm not sure what happened with the poor fellow which got ones which didn't fit. but worked just fine for me.It's the genuine hoover product. not the knockoffs sold on here as well.  I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever. when these bags last months.  Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly."
4,"This movie was great. my wife and I decided to go see it last Saturday night. Jesus was played by the young and attractive heart throb. James Caviezel. Jesus was taunted ruthlessly. Jesus was beaten mercilessly. Jesus was whipped until every inch of his body bled. Jesus was kicked. spit on. and humiliated. Finally he was crucified.Needless to say my wife and went home and I had the best sex of our life after later that night after the flick.The only thing I was disappointed with was that it wasn't Monica Bellucci who did the whipping."
4,"this is the type of movie I would definitly recommend it for first time viewer but on personal note I would also say I will never watch this again. the thing is despite its christ we are talking about. it is still very hard for me to looking at a man being tortured like a hanging lamb in the kitchen while is considering myself is being entained in a movie.. IT IS TOO GROSS! the fact is it goes beyond the line there are anything horible things you ve seen in movie theater. that's what credit this movie as one unforgettable one in history. By comparing this to Hannibal. Hann is barely just a little kid's nitemare. Every minute of this movie chanllenge your sense to tolerante the scale of brutality upon someone to a new level. I would say if your a believer it could work better since the man you looking at aint normal human to you after all. so its more relief since its a 'super being' is tortured but not human like you and me..."
12,"When I had this game. I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game. It's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you. It has a four player mode. which is not bad. but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although. that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games. too. I wouldn't mind playing this. Oh. I have the one on Gameboy Advance. which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64. Now. that confused me."
2,"We have had this model for over a year and. while it does make good coffee. it is SUCH a pain to clean.  You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made.  Also. the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water.  If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine.  My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"
2,"My last masher (from a respected and pricey brand name) couldn't take the pressure-literally!  One day I'm just mashing up a batch of potatoes and *snap&#34; it's time for the trash bin.  That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid. heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.  I'm not sure I could break it if I tried!  Works great at mashing (just as good as one with square or circle holes). and the large grip makes it easy to hold even if you get a little butter on your hands (trust me. I have done it)."
11,"If I'm being honest. I must mention that although this game specifies 'thirteen and older' as its primary audience. the reality is that twelve and under kids are most likely going to enjoy this game. It's a party game that families can play. but accomplishing the tasks on the cards is more like kid-oriented fun. Gathering beads in order to win is the object. but unlike the real Mardi Gras there is no 'adults only' behavior involved. I rated the durability high. but again this is a game that should appeal to younger kids - who are prone to losing things like the strings of beads or the cards. The game comes in kind of a cool clear. soft vinyl case. I liked the 'mind control' category the best. which entails a little more subtle strategy that getting someone to refuse to pick your trash or finding someone who likes vampires more than werewolves. This is a game I can't imagine bringing out very often and its kind of expensive for what it is."
5,"I have owned two of these stands. The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared. The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place. Not the greatest stands by any means. but for what they're worth. I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one. Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable. But price. ability to collapse. and it's light weight made it the one I bought... again."
3,"This is a short novel that packs a lot of punch. The good writing. tight plot. intrigue and strong characters make this short novel stand out among the smorgasbord of werewolf romances that have recently flooded the romance market. (i.e. it's not about lust lust lust hung together by a threadbare plot)The only drawback of this book is that it leaves you wanting for more! Man. I would be first in line to buy the sequel. The plot has so much promise and has much more potential to be expanded and explored. (Don't worry. the book doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything. it's just that the book has gotten you so addicted that you wish there was more to it. like a sequel)"
4,"I've been awaiting this two DVD collection for almost a year now and I can say that it was well worth the wait. This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new 'recut' version with I've come to call 'the PG-13 cut' becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film. This is a DVD worth the purchase price."
2,"I got the 35-gallon size to store some items in the basement that I wanted to be able to get to conveniently but also be able to lock up and keep out of the kids' hands. This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended. Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry. It is very well made. Of course. I'm not truly putting it through its paces by using it in a truck bed or travelling through air ports with it or anything like that. but after receiving it and having a chance to see how well made it is. I have little doubt it would excel for those uses as well.Note: If you are looking on putting a lock on it. I recommend you get the 'cable' style of Master combo lock that Amazon suggests. The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock. Not impossible. but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable."
9,"UPDATE:  Initially gave this 5 stars because of good function.  But after only 9 months. the rubber that seals the goggles against the eyes is cracking and brittle.  I din't expect them to last forever but less than a year is still disappointing.  They have been used fairly heavily I would say.  END OF UPDATE.  Sometimes I hesitate to buy something because it seems too cheap.  These aren't going to last forever but what they do well is keep water out of your eyes and they have flat lenses so your view isn't distorted like with some goggles.  We'll see how long they last."
4,"The overall impression of this movie is of a very nice movie for children; almost everything about this movie is suitably designed for young children. I have not read the books and watched this one on a hunch. The movie was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching all the way to the end but I would expect many members of the younger audience. pre-teen for example. to enjoy the movie much more.Of the actors only one was familiar and that was Dean Jones and he was also one of the few that didn't specifically look like they were acting.The scenery was beautiful and had some very lovely settings in the woods of North Carolina. The overall ambience of the movie was appropriate for a young audience as well. This is a good solid move for children and I recommend it as such."
11,"I got this for a six hour car drive to entertain a 4 year old boy.  It kept him busy for quite a while. I don't let my son play with car toys except when we are on long trips (they stay novel then and he is kept busy for longer requiring less frequent stops and we can keep driving) so I can't speak about durability or if the wax sticks will keep up their sticking power.  It took my son a while to realize he didn't have to follow the books directions and could make his own designs but I think that is a function of age rather than product design.  Over all I think this is a worth while purchase for travel."

3,"Just finished the second book &#8220;View To Kill&#8221; in this very sensational storyline. what can you say about characters that are so well written that they grab you from the beginning and not let go even after the story is finished.  This story maybe short but it is a joy to read. to devour and not want the story to end. the character of Sachin was terrific. he saved her. watched her as she matured into a fantastic women. and how he loves her. he definitely has a wonderful match in Paige. a perfect pair."
2,"My father has had one of these ice cream maker for about 25 years. I got mine about 10 years ago. and just got one for my son & his wife.  After trying some of the 'cheaper' models. I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.  It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream. and we make it all summer long.  The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.  It has a chance to harden up. and the kids always like having the dasher for a pre-taste!I don't think you'll ever find a better ice cream maker - and I hope you enjoy yours as much as my family has ours!"
2,"We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001.  I installed a bag and thought it worked OK.  (I did not throw the former bags. not Hoover bags. out.)  The next time the bag needed changing the lady who cleans the house (unbeknown to us) installed the bag we had been using previously.  My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference.  After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use.  I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured.  While not very scientific. it convinced us.  I have thrown the other bags away.Additional Comment:Because of the small particles that are trapped in the bag. I take the vacuum outside to remove the filled bag.  This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house."
2,"This is a great. old-fashioned style of potato masher. which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood. What it has. though. that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design. with a comfortable handle. It also contains a hole at the top of the handle for hanging on a rack.This is excellent not only for potatoes. but for apples. carrots. various kinds of squash. turnips and other soft-cooked fruits and vegetables.The masher is made of durable stainless steel that helps you avoid rust."
4,"I hated it from the beginning to the end.  The plot was too predictable with very little surprises.  The lines were weak and uninspiring.  You come to a point where you literally want to see Jesus die so that the suffering would end for the viewer. Talk about flogging a theme. this one wins. palms down!Again I got caught up with the hype and controversy. regarding this film.  I made a promise to myself that this would be the last film that I shall purchase. before I see it first. so help me God!"
9,"I've been using Fireline in my beading projects for about eight years. and it works great for when you're using Swarovski crystals or beads that have sharp edges.The 6-pound count is nice for beads that are heavier and projects that have more weight to them.You just need to be really careful not to knot your projects; quite a few beading instructors have been warning that knots will break with this. and I've seen it happen when they demonstrate it.The smoke color will leave a grey residue on your fingers. but I rub it through a piece of Kleenex to take it off before I wax my thread. and have no problems.I was so happy to find this on Amazon since it's much cheaper to buy it here than from a beading store or beading website!"
3,"I got one book. for free from my libary (# 3) so at that time I did not even realize these were a series.  But I really enjoyed that one so I went back to start at the beginning with this book.  I don't think you have to read them in order. there is enough information that I did not feel lost reading them out of order.  I really liked the story of this first book. the characters were very endearing in my opinion. I hope this helps someone else enjoy a good series."
7,"I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens. cabbage. bread. and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.For best results at indirect cooking. use the hinged 22 1/2 inch grate.  That way you can add coals throughout the cooking process without the danger of having to totally remove the cooking grate."
9,"I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix.  It works well. and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone.  The problem is. after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out.  The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out.  For only $15. I was not expecting miracles.  But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear."
7,"So what did you want to know? I started my trimming carrier with the Black & Decker Automatic Feed Spool (AFS). It is just plug and go. I prefer my trimmer string to come from Black & Decker. This way I will not come unraveled trying to use some cheap substitute. The spools last longer than expected. But all good things come to an end and you don't want to be half way through the yard when you find yourself strung out.Black & Decker CMM1200 19-Inch 24-Volt Cordless Electric Mulching Lawn Mower"
2,"I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range. It does take longer to clean. I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts. I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away. One should use soap vs. just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils. Then if I want a second pot. I either use the other set of parts or if both sets are wet. I dry the pieces with a couple of papertowels. This probably takes 2-4 minutes. I think it's worth the time."
7,"After using a heavy metal mower for years. this was a blast of fresh. light air. You can mow one-handed and wrangle the cord with your other hand....HOWEVER. we have officially just broken 2 of them. The first one was killed when the blade hit the protruding metal sewage pipe in our yard. The second one just broke now when I set the blade too low and hit an old tree root under grass. The blade got bend. and may be replaceable if the main stem is also bent. I also hit a rock a few weeks ago and almost broke it then. too...Best for even yards without anything that can bend the blade. The cord is a total pain to wrangle and keep from going into the blade...May consider a rechargeable battery model next...."
2,"This product is getting great reviews for good reason. Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way. First. freeze the bowl overnight. Second. chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled. Use pure vanilla. not imitation vanilla extract. In doing both of these things. I've found I've been able to create soft serve ice cream. which I then freeze for a couple of hours for a hard serve. In not doing these things. I've found that I create milkshakes. and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants. To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie. Amazingly. the recipes in the instruction manual show sorbet and frozen yogurt are on par calorically with homemade ice cream at about 215 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly. and I'll experiment with those recipes."
11,"I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested. It seemed a bit high in price to me. but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable. My children loved the story and got so into it. We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie (our current name. we haven't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book). It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues. Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for. the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that. i would recommend this book to people with small children."
11,"I love popup books and interactive children's books. and have to admit: this is one of my favorites. It's not complex/intricate. but it has a very cute storyline which combines colors. animals. and an interactive ribbon. If kids could make their own books. I think this is the kind they would make. Brilliantly done! I love how each page reveals a new color being added to the rainbow. and that when you turn the last page it 'reloads' the book so it's ready to read again."
3,"Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome. We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live. Author.  Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D.. shows us how to do just that in 7 steps. With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life. My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh? what's that supposed to mean. Overall though great read. very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree."
3,"This book didn't really go the way I thought it would.  For one. I expected more action overall with the fact that Griffin is being hunted and I also didn't expect him to find out about Jarrah so quickly.  The dystopian society was a nice touch but I would have liked some more detail about it to make the backbone of the story a little stronger.  Overall I liked the story but. honestly. I think it would've been better if there had been more conflict; really the entire thing was just too EASY and that's a shame because I could see the potential for a more in depth story."
8,"After two applications I saw no improvement on my puppy. Then I found out online that it is ineffective if it's applied within 48 hours before and after the bathing. Shouldn't this information be on the box if it's so important? I called the manufacturer and was 'serviced' by very argumentative representative. I don't think the product is worth the money at all. A friend of mine who used it also see no effect on her dog. You are better off buying from Hartz. At least their products are cheap and customer service is superb."
5,"This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last. The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series. which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1.2.or 3. I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele. The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun. (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder)."
8,"I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan"
11,"This game is laid out simply enough. all you need to do is collect the cards at the four corners and avoid turning into a zombie in the process. It takes some strategy though. 'Do I want this bonus or this one?' 'Do I go forward or double back?' The other cool thing is that your role in the game switches when you lose a battle to a zombie (roll a die and get a number less than the number on their card). Upon becoming Zombified. your new goal becomes making your teammates meet the same fate. Fantastic game. even cooler that it's based off the show."
3,"OK. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I saw this 'free' book written in the 1800s.  I wouldn't exactly characterize myself as a learned reader of literary classics.  I had just received my Kindle and figured. what have I got to loose?I was absolutely pulled in by this story and had problems putting it down.  It's a captivating mystical love story about an Egyptian princess.  This was the first Haggard book that I've ever read and I will definitely download his more famous literary works to read in the future."
2,"I'll be honest; I don't get much exposure to a great variety of vegetable peelers. but I would hazard a guess that this is one of the best.I bought this based on the other good Amazon reviews and have not regretted it. Its sharp and very efficiently does its job.My sister came over for Christmas and after using it on a few dozen vegetables was so impressed that she went out the next day to find one of her own. I have a reputation in my family for buying the best of the best. no matter the cost. so she was very surprised to find this peeler was so cheap.Buy it. it just works."
2,"OXO designs great products and this is no exception.  It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.  I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.  I liked it so much. I bought one for my aunt.Before this. I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.  I kept my masher because I'm a Southern girl and sometimes I want lumpy mashed potatoes.This is easy to clean -- throw it in the dishwasher."
5,"I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar. and will soon replace them.  On quality control. the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it. two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected. but it looks bad.  On sound. these seemed okay at first. but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week. especially the high B and E steel strings. which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck. more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball."
4,"This DVD was very advanced for my 18-month old. In Kids favorite Songs there is a lot of counting backwards from 10 to 1 which my kid loves too mimick (he still doesn't say much that can be understood) so I thought he would love this DVD. There is too much talking in the intro and it bores my kid as soon as it starts plus there is no Elmo. My kid loves Elmo and expects to see Elmo on Sesame Street. We are keeping this DVD for later when he is about 3 he might appreciate it then. Right now he has no interest in it whatsoever."
9,"got this for my savage fvsr .22lr .first yess the poi changes with the zoom . but you can figure that out and hold over ...on mills to compensate for poi moving...example-if u got zeroed at 9x and take it down to 6x same shott would be low.vise versa if you zeroed  on 6x ...so with the scope holding off on mils  still able to get decent 1.5 in groups at 150yrds with 22.lr and 3$ammo !! go to rimfirecentral.com to see many of the targets .yes the 9x is lil low on shooting  100yrd+ on paper but doable ...if they had a 500mm with 16x woulda been sweet"
3,"So. this book is long. and packed with lots of sex. The story is ok...but it seems to really just be background for sex scene after sex scene. To me. some of the descriptions of the sex went to the cheesey side of sex...rather than the erotic...but it was hot. And the description of his 'cannon' and use of it as a name...really?I guess I only gave it 3 stars because there really could have been more story here. I would have liked for it to have gone on in the end a little as to how it actually ended. To me. it just sorta stopped.So. If you are into hot and heavy steamy sex this is the book for you. If you want story with a side of steamy sex. this may be a bit much."
3,"Likeable characters and engaging story but the way the main characters suddenly became mates was a little too fast for me.  I prefer romances where characters work somewhat to get their happy endings since that aspect makes it more believable to me.  Still the characters here are very likeable and the story flowed well.  For the price of the kindle book it is a very good buy and worth keeping.  I will read the next story in the series and hope Amazon makes the third book available soon.  If not the third book is available at booksonboard.com."
2,"I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.  I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM. 0.8 Sones. Energy Star Fan).  The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least). which I do.  They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.  And they shut-off the fans consistently.  No complaints.  I would purchase one of these again. if it ever failed."
8,"My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat (so take that Ogden Nash!).  She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys. especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty. you might try these."
5,"I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. I've never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic. it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If you're wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings. definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not. but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board."
2,"I love OXO utensils and have many of them.  But I looked for quite a while for a meat tenderizer and missed the review that said not to put this tenderizer in the dishwasher.  Pound raw meat; wash it in the dishwasher in hot water. right?  The tenderizer I was replacing was aluminum.  Now this one looks like old aluminum--it's gray and nasty looking. Not something I paid extra for to get stainless steel.  It's totally not up to par with the usual OXO utensils."
12,"This is my favorite Duke Nukem game. It's got a ton of levels to explore and the variety in the levels keeps things interesting. I played it when it first came out for the N64 and after beating it traded it. I got nostalgic for it so bought it again last year to play. What a great trip down memory lane. I was taken back to the first time I played it and it was just as fun. The graphics look even better on my 46' lcd than they ever did on my old tube tv. A great game for those who like older shooters with some humor."
12,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought 'superman. I'll have to try that'. I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far. far away. Superman weeps."
5,"I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example. I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.  I love 'em. use them daily. and rely on them !!!"
12,"Ah. Crash 2. One of my favorite games as a little kid. It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels. [2 hidden] 25 crystals. 42 gems. and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level. once you get the regular gem. return to level one. and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus. you can save any time. unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy. and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses. If you have beaten a boss. hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again!"
8,"This liquid prevents the full development of fleas and repels ticks. It works well to keep my large dog flea free; unless of course we go some where with adult fleas that jump onto my dog.I have not found ticks on my dog; but I have got them on myself numerous times walking on the trails with my dog on leash.I have not found fleas on my dog after using this product consistently. It is great to see my dog not scratching from fleas.I tried many other liquids and powders; but this one and 'Advantage' are the two that have worked well for my dog with thick fur."
8,"Such a easy tool for our energized puppies! I had some problems with my wrist. It causes trouble for me when I throw a ball.I could not play with my 2 young dogs. This tool is so easy for me. I can throw a ball for them far and fast enough that they have to run hard to catch it.Even my 5 year old son can easily get the ball over 100 yards away.Dogs love it! Works great for us.The size is perfect. but we did not try the long one."
5,"I have been using these strings for 7 years.  At first I used the Elixir Polywebs. but those things broke all the time.  I switched to these and haven't broke a string since.  If you play a Gibson or Martin I would buy a heavier string. but these match well with my 414ce Taylor.  Because of the price I don't use these on my cheap Fender Acoustic. for that I suggest Earthwoods.  I even use the Electric version of these strings on my American Srat. very pleased there as well."
11,"This is one of the first strategy specialty card games I have ever bought.  I wanted to find an easy one to set up and play. quick gamestyle. and fun.  This is exactly what I was hoping for.  I liked the idea of character roles and it works out great. The gameplay is easy to explain to someone. is fun. and will be fresh for awhile with the bonus expansion that comes with.  Also. the box and cards it comes with are very nice.  Would recommend this game to casual strategy gamers like me."
8,"This product seemed to work for a couple of weeks at controlling fleas on our indoor dog who only goes out for exercise and to potty.  However one morning while combing her I noticed something stuck to her skin and much to my surprise it was a tick!  I thought it was very strange that the tick would be on her and still be alive considering that Frontline specifically states that it is for controlling both fleas and ticks.  Moving forward another month and it happened again - another tick.  This time I decided that this product just does not stand up to it's guarantee. nor does it work as advertised.  I will not buy again.Have since switched products. and have not experienced the same issue again."
3,"This was a great deal. especially when you get 4 books in one. I loved everything about these stories. All the stories had great characters; characters that were all so believable. I also loved the way the towns people interacted with one another on a daily basis. They all genuinely cared about one another like they were all one big happy family. rather than just being some acquaintance that just happens to live near one another. They all cared for one another deeply. they looked after each other on a daily basis and if someone was down on their luck. then they all pull together & they'd find a way for them to over come those obstacles in the way.I suppose it's because they live so far from civilization that they have to pull together. if they want to survive in that kind of wilderness.Would I recommend this book? YES!!!"
2,"This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker. and it's never let me down.  Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.  As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home. when the ice cream is done. it will . . . still be soft. but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.  Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.'  My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy. but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen."
7,"This has to be the best chicken rack out there.  It's easy to use. easy to clean. and pretty to boot.  I gave this to my husband with the cookbook. **Beer-Can Chicken: And 74 Other Offbeat Recipes for the Grill** (http://www.amazon.com/Beer-Can-Chicken-Other-Offbeat-Recipes/dp/0761120165/ref=pd_bxgy_ol_img_b/105-3317259-8297264) and it's been terrific recipe after terrific recipe ever since.  You CANNOT make chicken this good in the kitchen--it's better than any rotisserie. better than any baked chicken --ever--.  You've got to try this--you won't be sorry!"
3,"What do you get when you mix sci-fi and romance? Well if you're Cathryn Cade you get a compelling mix of the best of both genre's.In Tyger. Tyger Burning Bright we are introduced to the crew of the The Orion. the space ship version of a cruise ship. We meet some of the crew but this novel centers around the ships navigation officer Tyron Jag who goes through the mating shift while trying to navigate the new ship through an area of space that needs his expertise. We also meet Calla Fellura a novice crew member and the ships interpreter.The heat between Ty and Calla is intense. this is a total panty wringer. it is also amazingly well written with characters that are funny as well as sexy and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages and reaching for the next book. The world that has been created and the species that are developed are both fun and imaginative.While each novel is self contained it is best read in order so the sub plots in the novels are more understood."
9,"I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough. but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately. so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long. long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars."
8,"I bought this for my 10lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it. It's super rock hard! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents' golden retrievers to see if it interests them. Also. I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout. Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Instead I got the Stegosaurus. Perhaps that's why she doesn't like it :)"
9,"This Coleman stove has two 10.000 BTU burners that have independently adjustable flames that let you simultaneously boil water (on HIGH) or simmer (on LOW) whatever it is you desire. You can hook in a single propane cylinder tank that gives you 45 to 60 minutes on HIGH depending on your atmospheric conditions. This is a Coleman PerfectFlow stove that allows regulation of the propane pressure so some use and experimentation will get you desired results. It is a small unit. but it is very versatile and well-crafted. This Coleman stove has adjustable sides that allow for larger cookware and/or use to control temperature. Matches or such are needed to ignite the propane fueled flame. The bottom line on this unit is that it can really throw out heat and it is easily regulated."
3,"Can a woman from an abusive background find love and a lasting relationship. Apparently so. Can she find the love she needs in a menage a trois? Apparently so. Chris is able to overcome the trauma of being raised by an alcoholic abusive father and a mother who was completely submissive to him. Throw in a brother who has grown up to be just like the father and this poor girl has a lot to overcome. She did with the help of her lovers Jon and TJ. This is a short read can be done in one evening. While not out standing was entertaining. Chris is to be given a lot of credit for her strength in overcoming her horrible background."
7,"I bought this last week direct from the company so that I could take advantage of a bundle deal. Wishing now that I had purchased from Amazon so that I could return this easily.I would imagine that this item would be great if you are using it for grass maybe or in an area that is bricked or concreted. In my case. in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds. they don't die. Even the young ones. I ended up pulling the weeds the next day around the house. but I guess I need to find another solution for my 800 ft. gravel driveway.In negotiation right now trying to return the torch. I'll post later about customer service."
12,"this game lacked the ability to live up to name 'Tomb Raider' its more of a 'City Raider' half the levels deal with city-time scenery. and 80% of the enemies are humans. more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities (Venice) so i cant complain too much - just wasnt feelin the whole China scene. I liked to level skip those. and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week. just run around and jump for the most part."
2,"I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.  I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.  This little 'mighty mite' packs a big punch.  Superb suction. compact and light weight. but does not feel flimsy.  When researching this purchase I found the other customer reviews helpful. and I also found other references to this model as being one of the better canister compacts.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum."
12,"Okay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings. Some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get. And it has the exact same plot as every other Mario game. OMFG Bowser stole Peach whatever shall we do?! Get an ugly princess or something! And where the hell are the king and queen anyways?! The hats were also poorly implemented. The Flying cap is hard to use. the metal cap is rare. at best. and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap. They should have stuck to the 2D side scroller. And also where is Yoshi?! The fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustrating."
8,"this food is great if your cat doesn't have any issues like itchy skin or tummy issues.  If you have a cat with skin or tummy issues. it's time to get rid of the chicken and try a new protein. like rabbit.  All of my cats have really enjoyed this food. despite having some unbeknownst to me. chicken issues.  I have switched one cat to nature's logic rabbit with tremendous success and plan to put the other two on it as well to give them a break from this food (anything chicken). but if it weren't for that. this and the turkey version have been big hits in my house. including the cat that has tired of other brands of food quickly in the past.  Per Dr. Becker's protocol. I'm going to give their systems a break from chicken for a few months and then slowly transition them back. hopefully keeping them all itchy and dirty litter box feet free."
4,"This movie does have entertainment value. and it is affordable enough to entertain some friends at home on a rainy day.  The video is grainy. almost 16mm like in appearance.  The music and sound effects during the fights scenes reminds me of the 60's campy hooded crimefighter shows. ZAP!  BOOM!  POW!  Holy Low budget Cinema! is what Jack Nicholsons trusty sidekick would say if he had one.  There is a story and it is ok.  Buy it for your collection. otherwise pass."
5,"Its OK. the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank. i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can't complain about it not being worth what i paid for it. i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive. more adjustable and just more versatile. would i buy this. yes if i didn't try anything else first. nuff said."
12,"I'm not a great fun of Microsoft but I have to admit that they did a great job with this joystick. just for once. I bought the Saitek Cyborg 3D. Same price. It was horrible. Unstable. It was cool looking but what's the use a  cool joystick when you can't land your plane with it because it sends  random signals to your pc? Sidewinder is precise and reliable.  Also it's  multipurpose. I use it for Falcon 4 and Need for Speed and it's great with  both."
2,"I'm a long time fan of Oxo products. but this isn't one of my favorites. Based on an earlier review. I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream. The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out (doesn'5t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I've tried it both ways). Furthermore. after about 6 months of use. the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop. and feels &quot;wobbly&quot;. It's also not all that easy to get clean. The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher doesn't do the job. It's going to be replaced - just don't know if it'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand.  I"
5,"One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings.  In my opinion they're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever.  I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less-expensive alternative.I certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars.  I've heard no other string that has the crisp. clean. rich sound of this brand of strings.  I've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand... but always come back to this one.Different diameter strings will sound significantly different. depending on the guitar you use.  I prefer this mid-range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone.  Any lighter and the guitar sounds 'tinny'. any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck.  These are 'just right'."
7,"Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade.  Feeling embarrassed. I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I'd broken.  Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days.  I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly.  How often does that happen these days?  (I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old. thick branches.)"
12,"it was nice to see some of the greatest Nintendo characters come togeather in one game but all else form that this game is just to make your eyes sore!!! again i say these kinda games are for kids plain and simple.The game repetitive . annoying . trivial and of course my favorite definition meaningless to me. i felt that alot more could have been done to make this game a great classic. but only the characters can stand out!!!! nothing else. not even the game play. my little bro loves this game so i guess it's worth a play if you have an infantile intellects laterzzzz folks / gamers"
4,"Usually the first movie is the best one. and here it is true.  Ghidorah was always my favorie film in the Godzilla series.  We have some great monster battles. well detailed sets for destroying. and get to see Ghidorah with the meanness he's meant to have. only otherwise seen in Destroy all Monsters.  Both versions are very clean both visually and in audio.  The dubbed version is probably the one we all grew up seeing... with a lot of the added in music which. I feel. adds greatly to the film.  This is the copy all Godzilla fans ought to pick up."
8,"I've wanted to buy one of these fountains for my kitties for years.Last week it was one of the Deals on Amazon. so I splurged and bought a $25 gift for my kitties!They love it. I like having it there. it makes barely any noise. just a light trickle. The kitties love it. drink from it and play with the water stream.It's got a nice long cord. though I need an extension to put it where I want it. I like the on/off switch on the cord. and the water filter. It came with extra filters. at least a year's supply. Great value."
4,"I think it's great that the popularity of a recent film (Julie & Julia) has once again brought Julia Child into the spotlight.  When this series first aired in the mid 80's. I remember watching it to learn the essentials of food preparation and short cuts.  The very day I found out it was available. I immediately preordered.This two DVD set comes with an instructional booklet.  On the first. you will find Poultry. Meats and Vegetables.  On the second. Soups. Salads and Bread. Fish and Eggs. and First Courses and Desserts.  Both DVDs are well chaptered. so if you just want to watch one particular sub-chapter. you don't have to sift through an entire topic in order to do so.  As always. Julia is instructive. professional and completely enthusiastic.  Buy this now (together with the companion bookThe Way to Cook) and. if you haven't already. also get the newly releasedBaking With Julia"
4,"Robson Green and Michael Kitchen as two-thirds of a love triangle! I so enjoyed this production for so manyreasons. It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy. Well written. well acted. well designed. I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men. I bet if anyone asked her.she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career. I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent.Great fun."
7,"Since we live in the country. we have a lot of wildlife in our yard.  While they are cute to look at. they can do a lot of damage. and some of them don't smell very good(SKUNKS)!  We have had a problem with raccoons and skunks destroying flower planters and digging up newly planted annuals. This product helped keep them out of the flowers and the battery powered sprayer makes it easy to use.One winter the deer 'trimmed' all our shrubs. even the ones right next to the house. Since our area was hit hard by EHD this past year. we didn't have that problem this past winter; and I was delighted this morning to see three deer walking down our driveway. I love watching all the wildlife. and just try to keep them out of the flowers and vegetable garden."
11,"I ordered this game because my two children. aged 7 and 12. love games and they also love Rudolph.The game is basically a combination board game/ dvd game.  The DVD shows some clips from the movie and the game action is in the form of moving your pieces on the board.The kids were excited to try it.  It was simple for them to understand and they seemed to enjoy playing.  However. they only played with it one time.  It's been a few weeks since they got it and they haven't gotten it out again.  This isn't typical of them since they enjoy playing games.  So. I assume that they didn't find it all that enjoyable.If you or your loved one is an avid fan of Rudolph. it might be worth purchasing.  If you are only a passing fan. then you may not get much pleasure from this game."
7,"I purchased two of these with the hopes of feeding a few of the neighborhood birds. I knew instantly this was a mistake. but thought I would give it a try. One lasted only a few days at best. A larger bird actually knocked off the plastic holder that keeps the food in and it all poured straight to the ground. Entertaining to watch and the birds all thought it was great to eat the seed off the ground.  The second one lasted a little longer - a few months perhaps. but again. the same thing happened. Food everywhere and a useless feeder.  I am back again to find myself two new feeders for this year and thought it would be wise to advise all of you of my experience.  Sorry to have to give it a one star. but I can't find a reason to even go for two."
11,"This book has always been a favorite in our household with our two daughters (now ages 3 and 6). They both grew up with this book and it made for a great introduction to numbers and counting. The book consists of little plastic monkey faces showing through holes in each page. As you turn each page. one face stays back on the previous page so that the count of monkeys goes down. The story flows with the decrease in monkey faces as they monkeys do something silly that they aren't supposed to do and fall off the bed... until there are none left. My 3 year old still chooses this book pretty regularly for her bedtime story even though she already knows her counting. She thinks it's a funny story and we regularly tell them to 'stop messing around on the beds so they don't fall off and bump their heads.' It is a great introduction to counting for your little ones. Highly Recommended!"
3,"'Mistress to the Beast' is a take on 'Beauty and the Beast...' the plot has been summarized in other reviews. but I didn't read them. so I missed that connection before reading the book.The story was good- the book was a little shorter than I like. but it has a story and I believed most of the plot. Hunter's turn-around was a bit abrupt. and Lila's feelings could have been narrated more in-depth. but it was good. What the book did EXCELLENTLY. was treat race as a characteristic that didn't require comment. As a woman in an interracial marriage. it is so refreshing to see a Black female called 'beautiful-' not 'beautiful for a Black woman.' Neither character gave much attention to race. and their hang-ups were human. without the racial drama. I will definitely be reading more by this author!"
9,"I mounted this on my Henry lever action .22.  It fits the Henry. which is pre-grooved for rings. very nicely.  I didn't have to get new rings nor take off the iron sights. which was a big plus for me.I am not an expert on glasses so I won't (and can't) get too technical.  Lens very clear at all magnifications.  I was a little surprised nothing was included for 'clicking' the elevation/windage. but my pocket knife did the trick quite nicely anyway.  My local indoor range only goes to 50 yards and it took me about maybe 15 minutes to get it sighted in pretty close to what I wanted.  I was shooting dime sized 5-shot patterns in no time (from a sitting position. haven't done prone or off-hand yet).All in all. I doubt you can find a better bargain on Amazon than this guy if you need a cheap yet efficient rimfire scope.  100% recommended."
12,"I have always been a FF fan ever since 2 was out. I've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this. Let me tell you about the game:As you have probably found out from other reviews. it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc.. who is polluting the Earth. One of these members is a man named Cloud. a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier. which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles. they proved to be a challenge. Cloud. Sid. and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time. Espeically the 11 minute ending. Man that was good. ENJOY!"
11,"I bought this game for my 4 year old for his birthday.  We played it shortly after his birthday and he needed a little help when it was his turn.  He got a little frustrated the first time we played because he wanted to do it all by himself.  After playing this game a handful of times he needs very little help now.The game is fun for the adults in the house too.  It reminds me a little of dominos because you have to match future pieces with pieces previously played.  I think it is a little easier to play than dominos because there is a little less strategy involved.  However. it is still a super fun game.  I would recommend this game for a bright 4 year old. but be prepared to provide a little assistance.  A typical 5 or 6 year old should be able to play this game with little to no help.  This is a fun family game that everyone can play and enjoy!"
4,"Yes. it is I. the Edit Avenger!!Here to protect freedom and original art from plunderous corporations and soulless individuals!!!!If you are considering purchasing a 2004 or later release of 'Rudolph'. think twice. It is edited.I just ordered the original 2002 UNEDITED/no Destiny's Child 'Rudolph' DVD from eBay express. I got it sealed for $6.99 + $3 shipping.Do NOT buy edited DVDs when you can avoid it. Let's send the message. If you don't think that you make a difference remember this:Consumer complaints about the edits in 'Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge Collection Vol 1' were 100% of the reason that volumes 2 and 3 were released with absolutely NO edits whatsoever to the material.Good for us!Edits are for losers!I have spoken."
3,"Although this isn't the usual kind of read I expect when I think of Kallysten it's definitely got her touch.  I'm used to more erotic vs. sensual romance although this story lacks in the erotic it doesn't lack for emotion or conflict.Kate is an extremely strong female. Marc is a Vampire and Blake is his Childe.  The three make for amazing chemistry and witty banter.  From first meeting there is a spark and although Kate is put off by Blake's cocky attitude she's extremely intrigued by Marc and his relationship with Blake.  Kate has lived as a soldier for quite some time. she's bonded as a warrior with her fellow teammates. Marc and Blake bring the woman back out in her.  They all give one another a different perspective on why their fighting and exactly what their fighting for.I enjoyed this book and will definitely be finishing the trilogy. I can't wait to find out more about these characters."
9,"Dr. Bronner's Rose Castile Soap is really great stuff - while we haven't used it on our laundry for house cleaning purposes. we have used it for all sorts of personal care cleaning purposes. including to use to wash our hair. faces. and bodies.  I'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo. as it's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it's rosy scent. however. it's really nice to use as a face and body wash.  As a shampoo. it tends to dry out my hair a little too much. also.  As a face and body wash. I haven't noticed any effects of drying out my skin. and the scent is not strong enough to overpower. but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented.  The scent is not chemically or super girly smelling - my husband even likes using this soap!  Highly recommended."
11,"This is a very subjective review.The game system is pretty much the same as all the other Munchkin games.  Get to level 10. get the treasure. stab your buddy etc...The only reason for the lower than usual review is I'm not enamored with the genre. sort of like Munchkin bites. it's just not my kind of theme.  If outer space antics are your style then you will enjoy this game much more than I did.My son has Every verison of Munchkin (except blender) and this and Munchkin bites are the two I pass up whenever possible.The game likely deserves another star but I just don't enjoy it enough to give it."
7,"We use these loppers for our habitat restoration work at the Nature Conservancy's Ives Road Fen Preserve.  They can cut a fairly large bush or sapling.  After 100 hours or so of use the linkages wear.  After more hours the fiberglass handles become flexible and fracture where the rivets go through them.  We have figured out how to rebuild/repair both of these areas.  In seven years two blades have broken.  Replacement blades can be purchased from the Corona website.  A homeowner using these would have no problems in a lifetime of use.  These are the best combination of high capability and low cost that we have found.  The anvil type blade can be easily sharpened with a hand-held angle sharpener."
8,"I have been using Zukes for my Shihkingnese Dary for about a year.  She was having difficult with her rear hind quarter.She would often skip on her rear right leg.  I saw this product at a local pet boutique. and I decided to give it a try.After about a month of use. I noticed that Darby was no longer skipping.  However. when I was not consistant with its use she began to skip again.She likes the flavor and considers it a treat.  When I forget. she immediately reminds me that her treat is in the bed side table.  When I used the product regularly. Darby did not skip.This package is much larger than the one I purchased in the boutique.  It is also much more cost effective.I ordered this particular order for my Dad's 12 year old pit. Angel. because he was worried about her mobility issues.I thought if it worked for Darby. surely it would also work for Angel."
4,"Excellent film has many gripping and brilliantly realized scenes throughout.  I am sure many people are going to be divided about this film although I do not believe that it is anti-semitic in the slightest.  It will be very violent to some.  I thought that Gibson directed the film amazingly.  The acting by Jim Caviezel is astonishing.  Well shot cinematography and musical score.  But I can't say that it is the best religious film I have ever seen.  That title still belongs to 'Ben Hur'."
9,"Got this case for a projector I received that didn't come with its own case.  Pelican products are always very high quality and backed by a full warranty.  I received the case quickly and it was perfect for my needs.  The pluck and pull foam insert is very easy to use to make a custom fit for your equipment.  Took me less than 10 minutes to make separate cutouts for the projector. the cord and the remote.  (Useful tip - purchase a container of desiccant if you are going to store electronics or other sensitive equipment in this to absorb any moisture)"
8,"These are perfect for stuffing toys. like kongs and other types with smaller holes.I put round and square ones into my Aussie's large regularly shaped kong. and the biscuit-looking ones into my rat terrier's stuffable chew toys. She doesn't get the regularly shaped kong. because her jaw is smaller than the kong's opening. so she fishes the cookies out very easily. She gets other toys (from Petsmart) which are very tough as well. but have smaller openings. like KONG Stuff-A-Ball. It takes her over 20 minutes to get them out.  These cookies are much harder than regular biscuits. It takes her 5 minutes to get the regular biscuits and snaps out of any toy.my rat terrier is a very powerful chewer..."
7,"First of all. this is a light duty set of tools.  If you've got a large lawn and garden to take care of. I think you'll be happier with a corded approach to electrical tools.  But I've found this perfect for my needs.  Each battery is perfectly capable of powering the blower for five minutes or so. and since you have three batteries you can clear quite a large area.  The clipper and trimmer are top notch and seem to run forever on one battery.  The blower is about half as powerful as the best corded models. but it's adequate for blowing junk over hard surfaces."
9,"Greatest soap ever! I love how clean it makes me feel and the tingles I get from the peppermint! It is very refreshing! If you ever read the label on the outside there is a lot of crazy stuff on there like different ways to use the soap even using it as toothpaste.Pretty crazy.We love this soap though!Seriously the best soap!Try this soap if you have not already. That alone will convince you how awesome it is.BTW IT IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE! You only need a small amount of the product so it does last a very long time."
3,"The events of 'Ylesia' take place during 'Destiny's Way.'  If you've read 'Destiny's Way.' you will see it mentioned in passing.Jaina and Jacen go to Ylesia to fight the Peace Brigade to show them that it's not good to align themselves with the enemy.  From there. it is page after page of battle scenes.  It is endless.  One huge chapter.  It's like the chapter that was cut out for good reason.'Ylesia' doesn't advance 'Destiny's Way' or 'The New Jedi Order' in any way that I could tell.  We don't learn anything new.  There is no insight.  If I had skipped it. I wouldn't have missed anything.If you don't mind reading in PDF. 'Ylesia' is available free from Del Rey.  If you Google. you'll see it linked to the Wayback machine and it's still there."
11,"This is a fun family game for Simpsons fans. It is more fun that other Scene It games I have played and was more enjoyable for the whole family. This is a good value since it's the Deluxe version for the same price as some stores sell the regular version. Some of the trivia questions are hard. but everyone has a chance to do well since many of the questions are based only on observations from the clips that are shown. This would be a great addition to a family game night collection as well as a welcome gift for a fan of The Simpsons."
7,"This product works as advertised. my tomatoes are doing very well.  However. it is VERY heavy when filled with dirt and watered.  You need a sturdy hook and place to hang it.  I was having problems with it drying out quickly (granted. I live in New Mexico. where it is quite dry) even though I had added water absorbing crystals to the soil.  I ended up removing the top 6 inches of soil and placing a plastic milk jug in the top.  I punched some holes in the bottom of the jug and I fill this with water nearly every day.  The water then slowly seeps in to the soil instead of running out the bottom. dripping is reduced and the plant gets the water it needs.  I would give it five stars if some system were in place to keep it from dripping so I could use it indoors and if it were a little easier to plant."
11,"This game is great for parties. especially the ones geared more toward family-centric or youth-centric. It's actually pretty fun and interesting the first time. mostly because of the 'new game factor'. but after a few times. it does get repetitive. It's a great idea. but it's definitely not something that you can pull out time after time like Scrabble or Monopoly. Although these are completely different types of games. it does show that in my opinion that Party Gras is not a game with high replayable value. Attach on this fairly high price ticket and I wouldn't want to even give this game a try since there are so many other games with smaller price tags with so much more replay value."
4,"Very dated (late '60's type of humor) but still worth watching if you absolutely love Woody Allen's sense of comedy and his self-loathing study in cinematic pathos. I purchased a used copy and don't feel cheated. Perhaps a Woody Allen diehard fan's must have. but for the average person. this might be one of those you don't really need to own - or view. I watched it expecting more. but realized I've become overly sophisticated in my appreciation for comedy over the last four decades.  It's paced like a television movie-of-the-week. and there are long pauses throughout. The narrative theme is 40's years pass&eacute;. but interesting for anyone who remembers 'Tenspeed and Brownshoe' growing up..."
7,"I got this at a neighbor's recommendation and I am glad I did.  I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight.  This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste.  I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg. which deer and small rodents apparently don't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell. it is not overpowering and it does do the job.  This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a  motorized pupmp that runs on batteries.  It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray.  I would certainly recommend this.  It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery."
7,"This product was lightweight and easy to use. Even a person with back problems will be able to use this product with ease and minimal strain to back. It was easy to assemble and I had no problems with using this trimmer.This product was good for trimming; however. it did not work well for cutting thicker grass and weeds. I found it fairly easy to change the spool wire on this product.  I recommend buying the trimmer bundle that comes with extra wire and spool.Over all. this was a good product and served its purpose and the price was right. My husband loved it."
7,"I can't complain about the squirrels because I put out peanuts and corn for them so I am inviting them into the yard. But they seem content to eat corn and peanuts. They don't bother my other feeders. They are like little monkeys in the yard. I like to watch the squirrels. However this feeder still seemed like a good idea.I have had it up for a few weeks. I have black oil sunflower seeds in it. The birds hit it regularly.It looks great and seems quite durable. I have mine hung from a garden hook."
9,"This thing GOES.We get our best results from a determined onslaught to bend the ring DOWN on both sides. like a taco.  Hold it in place for a minute. and then the ring gets great lift and is easier to aim.  The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.This is great to keep in the car.  For my littlest son. we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close.  For bigger kids. they have plenty of time to run into position for cathcing the disk -- this thing floats for a long time.Watch out for trees.  And I guarantee you it will sail out of a normal suburban yard. so watch for cars. too."
8,"My family adopted a Golden Retriever who loves to fetch.  Problem is she's a slobbery mess. and I hated touching the balls.  I also can't throw very far when compared to how fast she runs. so games were short. and she wasn't exercising her full potential.Not any more!  I can probably throw the ball 250 feet now. and my dog is huffing and puffing in a few minutes!  I usually play with two balls. one she is fetching. and the other is ready to go when she comes back.  She wasn't very fond of the tennis ball that comes with the launcher. however I ordered some of the orange chuck-it balls and she's doing well with those.  You'll definitely need a large open area to use this though!Definitely worth the money."
2,"This is a great cordless vac. I have two dogs and this picks up all the hair without getting clogged! (works great on floors- medium success with carpet so if you have carpet this may not be your solution). I have an Electrolux that was specifically advertised to be good for people with dogs- what a waste of money- it clogs with the first pass- don't make the same mistake.  The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job.  It's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all."
9,"I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set based on the positive reviews I've read here on the product and the customer service. Fortunately I have not had to use the customer service. But the product is as advertised. I wanted to hold off on writing the review until I got to use the bands for a little while. I have been using it for my P90X workouts along with dumbbells and it has performed flawlessly. The quality of the bands are excellent and when you think about the cost it is a real bargain. Rarely does a product exceed my expectations but this one has. I highly recommend these bands."
7,"Currently I hate this thing.  I may need to oil it/adjust it or make some other modifications but it squeaks of metal on metal and cuts about 1/3rd of the grass I pass over with it.  I found a manual mower like this in the yard of the first home I bought and used it for years.  It was better than any mower I've ever owned.  This seems to perform like a cereal box toy imitation of what a manual push mower is supposed to be like.  Pooptastic.  I will update this review if I am able to modify it to actually cut grass. but out of the box it seems to make far too many blade passes per distance traveled to ever perform well.  Also the last model I had had two counter-rotating blades and this only has one rotating in one direction against a stationary blade/block."
5,"Dava picks are one of life's guilty little pleasures. They may seem pricey for picks. but they're still not that expensive. I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all gone.I use these to play slide. I also have Fender and Musician's Friend picks. but those are just the standard flat stamped-out pieces of plastic. The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control. And they just plain feel good to use. The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide. but with Dava you get a great grip."
2,"I have used a number of these for years with no problems whatsoever.  However I realized that the timers use more power than some of my lights!  I have a 4 Watt night light which we run all night in the hallway and the timer draws 5 Watts - 24x7.  That was bad enough. but then I replaced the 4 Watt night light with an LED bulb that draws 1/2 watt or so.  It was way cheaper to run that 24x7 then to use a timer to 'save money' and have it only on at night.  I have thrown these all away and purchased digital timers - they pay for themselves in energy savings."
5,"This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized; at least you can have one place where you can find a pick. as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case. but a small baggie will work just as well. Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage? Sometimes (depending on the amount and size of the pick) it's hard to get the pick out of the holder. and if you use something other than the standard shape. forget it.  It has an adhesive backing. so I guess you can stick it on your amp/guitar/wall/small animal. but I'd rather not."
7,"I use a tumbler that I rotate every few days.  I sprinkled a cup of this into the compost that was already in there. with some fresh vegetable skins dropped into it. and within a few days there was a noticeable increase in the matter. with a black. rich compost all around.Now mind you. I live in southern Arizona and we already get the hot. dry heat this time of year.  I don't plant my summer garden until the monsoons hit in July. By then this compost will be ready.  I can actually use what is in the tumbler now for my growing tomatoes.  I keep the compost damp and turn the tumbler regularly.  The outside heat helps keep the matter hot.One thing I noticed when I first used this on my compost is that the bugs that were already in the tumbler scrambled.  Apparently even beetles and roaches give way to this stuff.  And that is a good sign."
3,"I had never read any of the old Classics so I picked up this book after reading so many good reviews.  It did start a little slow. but at the same time intriguing with the mystery of where the bullet came from.  At times I could not put it down.  I enjoyed all of the characters. and found it very interesting how they created things we take for granted today.  It's hard to remember that people used to have to do everything for themselves. it sure has been a lost art in the western society! I found the writing wonderful and Jules Verne painted wonderful details which made the story itself such a pleasure to read!"
3,"Okay so this book literally goes one paragraph in the present. then a flashback. present for a bit. flashback. It was so annoying. I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE. you are MARRIED. you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him. It was just a pathetic excuse for a book and really. writing in general."
3,"I've always like the Reader's Digest for a good blend of writing from humor to drama. having subscribed to the print version a number of times off and on over the years.  The actual content quality has always remained consistently high for this publication.It does seem the print version has become overloaded with ads. but that was less of a problem than the annoying cardboard insert/tear-out ads that make the thing physically difficult to read.The Kindle version is a very much improved experience over the print version. with the same high quality writing. of course.  A bonus is that the linked navigation makes it really easy to find an article for the mood I'm in at a given moment."
8,"For some odd reason I thought these were chewable. which clearly they're not. I'm not exactly how sure the dental part works in. I haven't noticed better breath or less tarter. It's a hard plastic toy. luckily for me my dog knows better than to eat the pieces she chews off. she just spits them out. If your dog isnt that way I wouldnt recommend as it could do inner damage or atleast monitor your dog. Im giving the product 4 stars because it did arrive earlier than expected. it does keep my dog entertained. shes more interested in chewing this toy than furniture. She seems happy with it so im happy."
8,"I thought this would be a little bigger. but that's okay since my American Pitbull Terrier is only 5 months right now. and my Ridgeback mix is medium sized. This is a great size for small-medium Dogs. It's an interesting shape and my Moms cairn terrier mix female claimed it right away! Haha. It's textured for teeth cleaning and strong for super chewers! As with any hard chew toy. do keep an eye on your pet while they chew so they don't hurt a tooth. Ive heard that this can be a problem."
9,"Sorry. I'm just not a fan.  This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes. but I just couldn't get the hang of it with knives.  The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle.  The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you're trying to sharpen. rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks.  I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result."
2,"Needed a small. light duty. vacuum for our store.  After checking various reviews. purchased this item from Amazon.  It is compact. lightweight. has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag. which I prefer.  It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.  We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.  Three minor. non deal-breaking negative elements are - 1) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily; 2) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap; 3)the power cord has a wrap-up rather than retractable storage mechanism.  But. the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.  I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.  All. in all. this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive. convenient vacuum."
7,"This may look like a gimmick to you but it's not.  This planter can actually grow tomatoes and other vegetables.  All you need is a sunny place to hang it.  If you live in an apartment or otherwise have no garden space. try this.  They call it a tomato planter but it actually should be called a vegetable planter.  Last summer I grew tomatoes. bell peppers and cucumbers in them.  I believe it needs to contain more soil (larger) to be an ideal tomato planter.  It grew lots of tomatoes but peppers and cucumbers did even better.  One trick to know (not applicable for tomatoes)- take the top plastic cover off and plant 2 vegetable plants per topsy turvy-- one in the top and one in the bottom."
7,"No more getting down on my hands and knees to cut grass that the mower can't reach. I use this to cut grass around my mailbox post. the street lamp post on my property. the big metal box the electric company uses to feed me from its underground cable. the post the cable company uses as my feed point and anywhere else that grass needs cutting which the mower can't handle.These shears are lightweight. are easy to use. cut the grass cleanly and. best of all. they let me stand up while using them. They do not require a battery. power cord. string or anything else besides a hand. Very handy. very useful and very good."
2,"This is a really convenient book stand if you like to read outside of home and don't have larger books. If you don't necessarily need the portability or if you have large/tall textbooks I would suggest you look at something more study as this tends to tip over/make indentations on the bottom of pages for those books. Also you can increase the height of the stand by pulling  up part of the metal frame. but even with doing this it doesn't really support larger books well enough to easily highlight."
2,"I bought this to clean up the bits of cat litter my cat tracks onto the bathroom floor  when he jumps out of his litter box.  For this it works stupendously.  I haven't tried it on carpet or as a hand-held. but it seems to be durable and have plenty of suction power. and it has brushes you can turn on for use on carpet.  The extra battery pack is a bonus. tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.  The battery seems to last a long time."
8,"WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was1 either completely ignored2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the companythis is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing"
5,"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across. doesn't require tension adjustment. and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second. it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard. it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets. causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby."
9,"This parachute is a lot of fun!  Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it. but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down.  He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction.This one is bigger than I thought it would be. which is a good thing. but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home.  If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around.  But if you have only 3 people to play with. while it still works. it's more fun with more people.  But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be!Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids!"
8,"I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer. so I knew I had to have some flea protection. I hadn't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors. Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline. Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile. I switched to revolution. but that is extremely expensive. especially when you have 3 cats. My only reservation about using this product is that it doesn't kill ticks. just fleas. Even so. I thought I'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I'm constantly rubbing them. So far. so good. No fleas or ticks and it doesn't stink nearly as much as frontline."
8,"I've had my Fresh Flow for a few years now and the unit works well. In fact. I purchased one for my mother's pets. I'm giving this fountain two stars because within the last year. the company has changed their filter replacements to this cheap piece of garbage that has barely any charcoal in it and slimes up quick. The new filters cost the same but now you have to replace them more often. I would think a cheaper product deserved a cheaper price. especially if you have to replace them more often. Check out the filters here on Amazon. you'll see I'm not the only one dissatisfied. Because of this. I am switching over to the Drinkwell system. I've checked out their filter system and it looks a bit more substantial."
5,"Compared these all in Medium .013's on a Taylor 210 dreadnought .... Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze. Martins Lifespan SP. Dr. D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze. and Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze and Phospher Bronze. I tried them back to back. Switching back and forth. Narrowing it down to D'addario and Elixirs. I did the same with these 3 sets. One day I'd try all 3 playing along with a cd. Then I'd try a different set every 3 days. The Elixir 80/20 comes out on top. Best sounding of all. smooth on my fingers. Second. Elixir Phospher bronze. last was D'addario. I'd be satisfied with the D'addario they do sound good. But the Elixir sounds & feels better."
7,"We try to keep unused containers stored upside down to prevent standing water that leads to mosquitoes breeding.However. my garden area consists of raised beds and earthboxes around the perimeter.  The earthboxes have reservoirs that hold water and mosquitoes often breed in them. leading to a garden full of mosquitoes.It really helps to drop some Mosquito Bits into the fill tube of each earthbox during the season.  I have a few other large containers that have attached saucers that fill with water.  They get some bits added too.This product works well.  A container lasts for quite awhile and makes it much easier to be in the garden and yard."
7,"As soon as you put this in your hand you will kick yourself for not having bought it sooner.  Like many. I bought $1. $5. $7 nozzles that lasted all of one season.  They are just cheap junk.  We forget about how often we replace them because they are cheap at the time.  This particular model is their heavy duty. which should last though hot summers and cold winters.  It has brass components. a nice sturdy feel and is rated for both extreme hot and cold water conditions.  It attaches easily and does not drip at all during use.  A small depression of the handle gives you a gentle fan while a full depression gives you a powerful stream.  Compare this one with that cheapo you have now and you will clearly see the difference.  It is certainly money well spent."
12,"I would say the gameboy color was the best hand held game system I ever owned or play. Something that you grew up using will stick to you forever. I still play my gameboy evey now and then. playing games that never get old like pokemon. The only thing I ever had bad to say about the gameboy color was that it does not have a back light and I have to use a worm light. If you ever owned a gameboy in your life it's something that you always keep with you or end up buying another one like me."
8,"Frontline Plus is the only product I've used until present when we started using a multi-purpose Heart worm topical that includes some tic and flea protection.  Seems one still needs Frontline type protection anyway..Consider getting a syringe and small container (available on web) and splitting larger does Frontline over two or more applications.  I'd not be comfortable using one so large that it took more than two or three months to use it all - and keep the unused portion in a cool/dark place I have been told."
9,"I discovered Dr. Bronner's soap pin my local food co-op when I was a student- more years ago than I care to admit. I can only echo what others say: It's the perfect all around hand soap. bath soap and dish soap. I buy it in gallon jugs. attach a pump (available at any good hardware store) and transfer it into quart containers for the bath. pint containers for travel. and hand dispensers for the bathroom and kitchen sink. A gallon lasts close to a year in my household- just remember. as the Doctor says: Dilute! Dilute! Dilute! ;-)"
3,"I give it five stars.Unbreakable by Sydney Somers is a fantastic action filled story. in the tradition of Buffy The Vampire Slayer that I found almost impossible to put down. The chemistry between the main characters as well as the secondary ones is outstanding.When the story first starts Jordan and her partner / lover Gage are brutally attacked by a war demon and in the process the fatally injured Gage ends up dying in her arms.Fast forward five years into the future. Jordan is still a cop by day but by night she's an a** kicking demon slayer with an attitude! So imagine her anger and hurt when she discovers that Gage didn't really die that night. Instead he's stayed away for the last five years in a misguided attempt to protect her from the shadow demons that she hunts and slays every night.This book is definitely a keeper. If you love stories about demons. heroes. hot sex and a great love that won't be denied then you are sure to love Unbreakable."
7,"I have a non-heavy-duty version of this hose. which has worked well for me for a year or so now. and I wanted another NeverKink. because these hoses seem to be flexible and easy to coil by hand. yet able to keep water flowing.This hose is quite a bit more rigid/inflexible than standard garden hoses and other NeverKink hoses. which makes winding the hose onto a hanger a little more difficult. and handling the hose a little more difficult in general. The hose does seem like it will stand up to a lot of use. though.My only major gripe is that the female end of the hose seems to have developed a leak already. after only a few weeks' use. seemingly at the point where the hose is crimped onto the brass fitting. I'll probably buy a replacement female connection from the home center and put it on."
11,"I got this game and tried it out on my family. They immediately loved it. even the family members who I'm usually hard-pressed to get to play. I bought most of the expansions that go with it that increase it from a max of 6 to 8 players. The game mechanics are very simple to teach. You will never play the same game twice with all the alien races you can be in the game and each of their own skills and abilities really change the strategy and game play of each game you play. I can't say enough good things about this game and I highly recommend it to anyone! This game has been around a long time and its gotten better with age seems like."
12,"DO not get me wrong.  I am one of The BIGGEST Zelda fans in the world. and I bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and  all.But this Just isn't a Zelda game....Its missing the Fancy tunes.  the story just doesn't seem that addictive.WHen you first get the game  its great and it looks to be one of the best games. but then after you beat  it.... its kinda boring...Zelda games should never get boring! Zelda NES  I STILL paly that damn game.' Link Not as good as the first but still I  like playing it. Zelda A Link To the pass on SNES is the BEST Zelda game.I just cannot love this game.. it did horrorble for a Zelda game."
4,"I have worked in Baltimore. Md for almost 40 years and have always considered Dr. Ben Carson as a &#34;hero&#34; of mine. I admire his honestly and the determination he showed in raising himself up and out of the slums of Detroit to become one of the most famous. and 'gifted' surgeons in the world.  This movie &#34;Gifted Hands&#34;. is a magnificent tribute to that man.  I am proud to own it and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a motivational boost and a 'spiritual high&#34;.  I also recommend purchasing this item through Amazon who not only gave me the best price but also gave me the fastest service and delivery time I could have ever hoped for.  Thank you Amazon.com."
11,"Ticket to Ride is a game my family and I have been able to play over and over and over again.  It's one of the best new games I've played in years.  I have the game. expansions and even the iPad version.  The classic physical board game is still my favorite with friends. but the digital version allows you to play against an AI pretty easily with no change in gameplay.If you know a computer scientist. math major or engineer. they will find the mathematical puzzle of solving the &#34;Shortest Path&#34; problem fascinating.A great gift for a friend or your family."
3,"This is it. the big kahuna of newspapers delivered right to your Kindle. You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this. This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle. It only lets you view the content on the Kindle. No printing articles. no emailing articles to a friend. no using it in presentations. You are stuck. Very evil is it not !So. if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend."
12,"My nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii. Once I purchased the game for him. we found out that the Wii controllers won't work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii. After doing a little research. I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card. Once we got both of those. the gamecube game that we bought finally worked! After playing the game for a bit while being &#34;tethered&#34; to the Wii system because of the cable for the controller. we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom. So we got these controller extension cables. He is happy!"
9,"My 5. but soon to be 6 year old daughter is going through a 'princess' phase and everything either has to have princesses on it or be pink.  The 'sweet pea' scooter is PINK.  But it is a nice. soft pink.  All of it is pink except for the upper shaft and the rear fender.  It's extremely well constructed - the same quality as the other Razor A Kick Scooters.  I have no complaints about this scooter whatsoever.  And it came totally assembled in the box.  I didn't have to touch a tool.  All I had to do was to pull the handle bars up and click them in place.  Even the pink pom poms were attached. These are top notch scooters and I have bought 3 Razor scooters so far: Two Razor A Kick scooters and one Pro-Model (for me!).So if your girl is into pink or simply loves girlie stuff but also likes to play and ride hard. this scooter will be perfect for her."
5,"I've always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. I've always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to. Would recommend to any level of guitar player!"
8,"I have 2 Dachshunds and a cat and this fountain is perfect. Purchased a different fountain and it stopped working after a few days. This fountain got great reviews. that's the reason why I got it and I'm very pleased with it. My pets have no trouble drinking out of it and they have fresh water all of the time. I do empty the water out and wash the bowl twice a week to get out the junk that the dogs' leave from drinking. which I would do with any bowl. Other than that. I'm sold!"
7,"When I first opened the package. I was disappointed.  This cover and box is about the same thickness & quality as a jiffy mini-greenhouse that you could pick up for less than 10 bucks.  If you're expecting a heavy duty piece. this isn't for you.  It seems to do the job though.  The little side and top vents are the same quality as the rest. so don't expect anything mind-blowing.  On the positive side they seem to do a pretty good job controlling humidity.  I have them just a crack open to keep things nice and moist and the heating pad is generating enough heat to fog up the cover.  As long as it doesn't fall over and get stepped on. I am sure I'll be happy.  One misstep though and this thing is going to crack and be ready for the trash bin.  I WOULD buy this again. although I'd be much happier if it were 15 bucks."
9,"I compared this to a standard whistle (the ones with the &#34;pea&#34; inside).  This is louder. so in an emergency. this can be heard from farther away.  However. it takes a lot more air to blow it.  Therefore. if an emergency includes you being injured or weakened in some way. you might not get much sound out of it.My suggestion is to have one of these. but also have the traditional (easier to blow) whistle in your pack or emergency bag.  If you have the energy to blow this. do so. if you can only blow the other one. even though it isn't as loud. it may still save your life."
7,"I recently received this product and just put it out yesterday.  It seems to be working wonderfully and there was a pile of dead insects this morning to show for it!!  I will post again if I have any compaints...but don't really anticipate any.  12/30/08  I now have a complaint!  The light in this unit was faulty.  It still comes on but the light is yellow and not white like it's suppose to be and it doesn't attrack the insects now. The light went out about 2 months ago so it wasn't but maybe 4 months old. 7/27/09 I ordered a replacement bulb on March 22. 2009 to get ready for the mosquito season...today is 7/27/09 and that bulb burned out 2 days ago! 4 month life span...AMAZING!  Needless to say...I WON'T be replacing it again at a cost of $21.99.....and will be looking for another bulb that will work in this unit."
8,"I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning. though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks. and it came apart into twisted. jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws. he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust. though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view. but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping."
3,"I just love these old mysteries and Freeman's are not as slow moving nor as  lugubrious and verbose as others. For myself. I find they are an easy read; that is. beautifully written. engaging and enjoyable.I especially liked the short stories and Helen Vardon and did not find the typos to be onerous. not finding above half a dozen in the last full-length novel. I am definitely going to be acquiring more of this author's work.  Thank you Amazon for making these pieces available and at such reasonable prices. In fact. many are free!!"
4,"As someone who has read a few books about the physical suffering Jesus went through. I was amazed at how real the physical events were portrayed in this movie; almost like Mel Gibson took a time machine and filmed the crucifixion as it took place.  Now if we could only build a time machine to send the critics back in time.Even non-JesusFreaks should admit this movie was filmed to perfection.Every actor was great.  Every scene captivating.  Every word. needed.  Not only was this a great movie. it is fact.  The most real FACT there has ever been.  The man (God) on that cross took those nails for all of us...even those that dare reject His sacrifice.  Buy this movie and share it with friends - believers and non-believers.God Bless!(...)"
8,"I found two young female cats wondering around my neighborhood and eventually caught them. their fur was rough and dirty from malnourishment and the harsh weather. After a bath and some good science diet cat food. they're as healthy as can be! Their fur is soft and their teeth are so healthy! I also leave a bowl of science diet cat food for the other two feral cats that don't want to be caught. I will not be taking my two new kitty cats off this food. they love it to much!"
3,"I was hooked from the very first page.  I had no idea what was going on and had to keep reading to find out what was happening.  Isn't that the point of a good read?  I wish that the storyline had been expanded more especially regarding the lead-up to the sting as well as the separation period.  The idea that Alex was beginning to accept his sexuality change was covered pretty well as well as the point of Shaun being in love with him for so long and finally had a chance to 'show' him.  I still thoroughly enjoyed the story very much."
8,"Our dog is an American Eskimo and we live in Miami. Florida. We have exterminated the yard. his bedding and had been using the Preventic Collar.  We also used Rose Geranium oil. all with no success of the tick infestation on our dog.We finally tried Frontline Plus and it has been a couple of weeks now and we are still having the same tick problem.  Adult ticks and baby ticks.  It's not doing a thing to help get rid of the tick problem so far.There are no fleas at all and plenty of ticks on the dog every day."
5,"I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it's EQ. Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to &#34;bassy&#34;. and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little. I really didn't expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. If you're looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar. I'd recommend this."
7,"This thing is awesome! Just big enough to cook for a small get together. but small enough to fire up for just two.  I currently have 8 different Weber Grill/Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them.  A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours.  Still learning different ways to cook with it. but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer.  TheLodge Logic 5-Quart Pre-Seasoned Dutch Ovenfits perfectly on top. and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue.It's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it. then after cook marshmallows.  Food. Friends & Drink!  Life is good......"
2,"This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.  I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.  I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).  I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.  I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.  It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.  I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.  I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto."
8,"I bought this product to supplement my Siberian husky&#8217;s home cooked diet that is supplemented with high quality kibble.  We have been adding Nupro to her 3 daily meals for nearly 2 months now and her coat is noticeably smoother & shinier.  Previously she had hotspots around her mouth from licking; Nupro has almost totally alleviated this.  Shockingly. she turned the powder down at first (we have read reviews that said dogs couldn&#8217;t refuse the smell/flavors) but now we mix the powder with water and top it onto her food and she can&#8217;t get enough.  This is a great product for anyone looking for a top quality dog food supplement."
3,"'True love doesn't need a happy ending. because true love never ends.'If you have read Dirty. the story about Dan and Elle. then you should also read this short novella. It's kind of an epilogue to Dirty. Elle and Dan are married now. and Dan would like to have kids. Elle is a bit surprised and can't decide immediately whether she's ready or not. Having children is a big step for her. After all. a woman can be convinced... :)I'm glad to see Elle again and to know that she's happy and loved. She needed this so badly! Dan is really a wonderful man and he cherishes Elle a lot. He's a good guy!Dirty was a very special read to me and it was nice to read this short novella. It made me feel good! I've read that Dan has a brother. Sam. and I am really tempted to read 'Stranger'."
12,"Tomb Raider 3 is the hardest of the Tomb Raider series (at least in my opinion). It has a very complicated plot. decent graphics. and a moderate amount of action--although I have not completed it myself. It could use more action and less puzzles. however. The biggest problem with it that I've faced is that it has a lot of bugs and errors throughout. Some errors can be fixed without a lot of hassle. others can be fixed but with a lot of hassle. and some can't be fixed at all. Myself. I don't have a lot of patience. I just play the game because I love challenges. So. unless you have a LOT of patience. or enjoy tough challenges like I do. TR3 is not for you."
2,"This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff. and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife. wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives. you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest. least-attractive lemon twists ever. and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK. it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane. or maybe a different zester. but this one is a turd. Finally. the handle is not 'comfortable.' it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy."
11,"This is a fun game for players of all ages.  The board depicts a map of the United States (in this version; other versions exist for other locations) with train routes of appropriate lengths between major cities.  Players have tickets from one major city to another.  In order to get credit for that ticket. the player must build their train between those cities.  Combine routes to get points for more tickets.The game requires logic in that you need to plan your route appropriately; longer legs earn greater point values.A good time is had by all!"
2,"Bought for 3rd time in November 2012.  Due to misadventures in moving we have had to buy this exact product 3 times.  The grip stays in hand with no slipping even if hand gets wet while using.  Peels excellent with little pressure.  My gal friend has rheumatoid arthritis and this is the only style she can use.  Got stupid once and bought the Kitchen Aid red colored one just because of the color and regretted on 1st use - handle was uncomfortable. slippery. and blades would not peel properly.  The OXO is easy to use. easy to clean. very reliable product and company.  Amazon price slightly better than any other store we researched."
9,"I have a philosophy about my new commuting experience that can be summed up as visibility trumps cool.  If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night (I guess folks do that) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light.  Essentially. this will do.  The Bell light makes light and flashes.  I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road.  It is fairly cheap construction. but it shouldn't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work.  The light is inexpensive and it works.  If you are concerned with batteries and the environment. buy a generator light... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one."
8,"I didn't get what picture and ingredients showed.  So I went to Pet store to rebuy My dog's treats.  They didn't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.the pet store was told the packaging would change. Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change.  So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed.  I may buy them again. I don't knowthank you Peggy W.Actually they turned out to be good. My new little chihuahua mix pup loves them and my sweet Jeffery who has passed away loved them.  review from 2 stars to 5 stars."
7,"I lost my pruners in a move and had let my plants get sadly overgrown while I was SURE I was going to find my old pruners. Finally. my front yard looked pretty ridiculous and I came here in search of relatively inexpensive bypass pruners. I read lots of reviews and decided to go with this. and I'm glad I did. I had no problem using these to cut small branches and bushes. The handle felt comfortable in my (fairly small) hands. it hasn't stuck or jammed. and they feel like they're made to last. Thanks for steering me right. other reviewers. :)"
9,"The knife itself is well made and comes nice and sharp out of the box. My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full-tang knife. and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt. The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it (the nylon model with the integrated multi-tool pouch) isn't really that great in my opinion. It's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi-tool there. but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it. so to each their own.That said. I have no qualms about my purchase and it's a solid. well-built knife that I anticipate will last me quite some time."
8,"I have been very happy with my Snuggle Safe heat pad. The claims of 10-12 hours of heat are true IF you insulate it a bit. OK. it cools off in 4 hours or so if you leave it sitting out. but under a blanket. it stays toasty for a good 10 hours (I don't think I have every checked it after 12 hours. but I expect it would still be a bit warm).Granted. my cats are not much interested (maybe they will be when the weather gets cold again). but I love it. I stick it at the foot of the bed (under the covers. so it stays warm). or even just hold it while I am reading in the evening.  I also got one for my Mom. who has Reynaud's Syndrome. and she says it is great. She just keeps it nearby and warms her hands as needed."
2,"The day I got this peeler. I compared how it peeled side by side with my other swivel potato peeler. just like an infomercial. or something. The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible. It takes no time at all to peel a potato. whereas I had to spend at least 10 minutes on it before! I'm surprised that most swivel potato peelers don't have any kind of grip on the handle. because after any length of time. holding it can definitely be hard on your hand. It peels carrots equally well. and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun."
7,"I used this in Vietnam. where the local butcher. Hang Kau Pung. asked me to use my gas grille for his yak. After butchering it. we used the grille to smoke it and had a problem when the ribs did not fit on the Weber 3601 Rib Rack. I had 5 Weber Rib Racks so they were useless and we had to put the cooked meat on the fly dirty ground near treated sewer water. I suppose if you are using pig Ribs they fit but be weary of larger meat animals."
1,"After reading the reviews. and recognizing the quality of OXO. I thought I had made a good decision. I was in for a surprise. I have one of those old tubs with some soap build up that is difficult to remove. With a little elbow grease. and with this superb brush. the soap scum is gone. Good grief. what a surprise. For years I have been trying to get that stuff off.  I am now going to scrub my stair carpet. Somehow. coffee stains have ingrained themselves into the rug.The raised handle keeps my hands and fingers above the brush. which makes it so much easier to use your full force. Thecontoured handle gives me a strong grasp for vigorous cleaning. The handle is nonslip. wet or dry. It is great for cleaning a variety of surfaces. from tile to carpet. There are two types of bristles for the optimum scrub. I have never found anything better for scrubbing out those darn spots!Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-08-14"
3,"Written poetically. But the horror of the trenches. he does not come too close.He sees the war from the stage. The wanton destruction of civilian buildings. churches. public buildings is just another step on the road of history. From the destruction of the Alexandrian library-up to the current Coronation Hiroshima. Nothing has changed. It is just waiting for things to come.He could imagine the horror only partially. The book does not fall into the category of war propaganda. It's the surprise. the mourning over the extinction of cities that have grown over the centuries."
5,"Arrive on time and as described.  I have yet to install but do not expect any surprises as have used these strings in the past.  I have read many of reviews on guitar strings as well as talked to many different guitarist.  Pretty well  all have their favorite set of strings.  What is interesting is they do not all agree on a specific type and/or brand.  So I reckon each has to find their own.  So far these strings have worked for me but am still experimenting to find &#34;the ones to love&#34;!"
11,"Our weekly DnD group had a set-back tonight. so we grabbed a copy of this from the local Target store as a stand-in.  All of our guys were quite entertained by this game. and it served as a great temporary stand-in for a sorely missed DnD session.  I would highly rate this for a gaming group looking for an engaging and fun distraction.  The variety in the play of this game is excellent. and while it's easy to grasp. it isn't easy to win...especially with a group of gamer's that will 'stick it to you'. The backstabbing is quite fun. and most gamers would get a kick out of the humor.  Overall. a definite thumbs up for gamers out there!"
1,"I am the dishwasher in my home. and I like good tools. It's been a slog to find a truly good dish brush. and here it is. I used the amazon.com info and went to Ace and found the same brush sold individually. Bought one. and have been using it now for two months. It cleans very well. is easy to keep from getting clogged. and it doesn't splay out bristles very much. I've trimmed off about half a dozen bristles all in all. and the brush still has a lot of life left in it. The UPC at Ace for the individual brush is 0 4130104554 3. I like this brush enough to think that I'll buy the dozen-pack when this one gets too far gone. Washing dishes with a good brush makes a lot of difference."
9,"Yes D batteries can be expensive. but my name brand batteries seem to last a long time. Plus the ability to take it anywhere is a BIG plus. My pump works just great on the 4 in 1 Coleman mattress. Inflated both in under 2 minutes. Deflation even faster. Remember. sometimes you get a dud. try again. I got lucky and got a great pump at a great price. I have tried those aero type beds. and not for me. Uncomfortable. heavy. must have a plug near by to inflate. I'm spur of the moment. so this travel pump is just perfect! p.s. it's advertised as a 4D pump. so you know before you buy it takes D batteries. so if you don't want the weight by a bike pump!!"
1,"I have been using this now for about 7 years and it is great.  First it keeps the razor clean and lubricated. so it never gets that bogged down feel or sound. second it has a nice fresh scent not the old stale cut hair smell that electric razors tend to pick up after periods of use.  It is my perception. I don't know if it is an actual fact that my blades tend to last longer before I need to replace them.  I love these cartridges. mine also last longer than the product description often not having to change them but every 2-3 months."
1,"I have had several maglites over the years and while reading the reviews decided to get this light because it is LED. WRONG. for some reason most of the reviews are on the LED version and this light is the battery eating krypton version.I have drawers full of these old ones and don't use them because they are just old inefficient technology.I was bummed out and requested a refund and planned to refuse the fedex shipment. But when I cancelled the order they said to just keep it. I really don't wont the damned thing but I think it would cost them more if I now refuse the package.Moral quandary.Maybe I'll upgrade it with the LED kit.UPDATE####################I bumped it up a star because it is now perfect since I added the L.E.D. mod kit by Nite-ize.It now has 25 hour battery life and is twice as bright."
8,"I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also. the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading. which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro. the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory."
9,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good. affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the 'tack' on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- . could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ . Holds air wellFeel - B+. more tacky than other basketballs. but feels greatBounce - B. GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- . I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors. recommended."
8,"I recieved this fountain in the mail approximately 2 weeks. ago. so I will enter a new review later if my opinion changes...That said. this is a great fountain so far.  Fairly easy to assemble. extremely quiet (almost silent). and very easy to refill...you can leave it running. remove the water container. refill and replace without having to turn the unit off.That said. it is not the petmate 'deluxe' model..no in-line power switch. no flow adjustment valve... so. don't buy this if you are looking for those features.Only time will tell if the pump continues to work as silently and as quietly as it has so far. but as of now. this is a good purchase for the money...given the mistake in labeling it as 'deluxe'.  It is still at least $10.00 cheaper than the same model at my local pet chain store."
11,"This game is a devastatingly brilliant example of a co-op game (all the players team up in an attempt to beat the game itself) where there is a near-perfect game balance. Unlike many other co-op games. this one feels like tactics can make a difference. and though it's not easy. victory seems achievable. Even more important. losing the game is just about as fun as winning (and very much in keeping with the Cthulhu Mythos genre).This game is very complex. however. and I highly recommend a rules- and detail-oriented person take the lead. facilitating the ability of other players to enjoy the game without getting bogged down in detail. In the case of this game. the complexity is enjoyable and well worth it. but it is notable because it may overwhelm new players and give them a bad first impression."
2,"I had never used a pressure cooker before but have been planning to buy one for a while. and decided to buy this one because it looks well made and has good reviews.I tried cooking several vegetables and some Sirloin tips (separately) and found the Sirloin surprisingly tender. the vegetables retained a lot more flavor.I did carefully read the instructions and after one or two uses found it easy to use. I bought a timer to use with it because cooking times seem to be important as does making sure it does not boil dry.This is a great time and energy saver. resulting in great tasting food!"
4,"Shiva Damienson has got it all wrong.  Every other movie about the New Testamont has been inacurate in their dipiction of Christ's crusifixtion.  If you've seen movies like Jesus of Nazereth and others from that era. than your eyes will be opened when you see this film.  If you consider the film to be overly violent than stay away from it. even if you are a Christian like me.  I am a Christian and was disturbed by the violence. but that was because it was commited against my savior: an inoccent man.  The movie is rated R for a reason. so this movie is not appropriate for a younger audience. but for anyone who has the stomach to handle it. than see it."
12,"Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played.  The graphics are excellent. you forget you are playing a game.  My dad thought it was a cartoon.  The story is wonderful. too.  I won't give anything away. but I almost cried at the end.  And the music is great.  You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song.  I highly recommend this game. but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one...It's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else...I had to start over about three times.  But the replay value is good. too. That's why I give Zelda 5 stars!!!"
12,"I was never a big fan of the first-person shooter (FPS) genre. but after giving Half-Life a try (thanks to all of the glimmering reviews). I am absolutely hooked. From the opening tram sequence. you're mesmerized by  Gordon Freeman's plight and the falling Black Mesa world surrounding him.  It's a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of  sunlight (apologies to my wife!). After dishing out punishment to those  Marines. be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes.  The fun gets even better. and the taste of death is even sweeter when you  blow apart that guy with 196 kills. Half-Life is truly a work of art.  Opposing Forces. here I come."
8,"I've had two of these fountains. and several family members also have them.  Yes. weird things happen. and at least one was returned to company with pump problems.  For whatever reason. they do not include the following information routinely in their packaging.  For a pdf that illustrates routine cleaning. and some FAQ's. go to: [...]  You need to take the pump apart and despite the instructions in pdf. use the pointed type q-tips. a wire cake tester. in-between-teeth cleaner brush(really). you get the idea. to clean it inside and out! My cats love this fountain. but we joke that one of them has a 'drinking problem.' because she likes to belly-up at front of fountain and drink from waterfall. resulting in a drenched bib.  The pdf should address many of the common complaints about this product.  Good luck!"
2,"So I actually bought this thinking it was the entire Lesson 2 kit. However. I've found through experience that having the book without having to take the class is a good thing. I've taken the Wilton Lesson 1 class and the number of Wilton items you have to purchase ALONG with the Lesson kit is a little ridiculous. I've worked my way through Lesson 1 and now I'm working my way (by myself) through lesson 2. I recommend anyone that likes to work on their own time to just purchase this book."
11,"If you enjoyed this dice-infused worker placement game. this expansion adds five new &#34;modules&#34; to mix in to your base game. Larger building boards. alternate building rows. unique roles. yearly condition cards. and non-random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time. The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game. Notably there is no board extension. no more dice. and no more monster cards but that doesn't hurt the expansion at all."
9,"This is a beautifully constructed. solid tool. Being so it is on the heavy side. The only faults that I find with it are: the phillips head screwdriver blade is hard to remove and there are three slot head screwdriver blades. In this day and age it is rare to find a slot headed screw and rarer still to need three different blades. On the other hand. the one phillips headed screw driver is of an in-between size (size 1?). a larger or smaller one would be more useful. I have found that it works fairly well with larger Phillips head screws.The locking mechanism for the blades is positive and easy to remove.I agree that the snap closure on the holster is inadequate.If the combination that includes three flat screw driver blades works for you then this tool is nearly perfect."
6,"My company uses over 50.000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them.  These stickers are top quality in every respect.  They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems.  The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers.  The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond. but will pull off.  It appears they are designed to do this.  I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.  However. in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us.  You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you."
2,"This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes. I personally took the other 2 levels of classes in the series. but couldn't fit this one into my schedule. so I bought this lesson plan and theWilton Flowers and Cake Design Student Kitthinking I could learn on my own. I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator. and very good at self-study on many topics. But there were still some things in this book that it would be helpful to watch someone else do instead of teaching yourself - fortunately there are plenty of videos on the internet that helped me get through this. Overall. this is a great guide to decorating. but be prepared to do a little more searching on your own if you want to learn to perfect everything."
9,"I've taken this to work. outside. to the beach etc.  I can't get enough of this thing!  When it starts getting boring I put it away for a week or two then shoot the dog with it.  Since he can't see it coming he things something just jumped in front or above him!  I even hit my mother in law several times and she had no idea the &#34;thump&#34; was what was causing her hair to jump!!!!!  This is even fun for my 4 year old. she can pull it back enough to get a nice air slug out even though she can't pull it back all the way and still aim.  Great fun!!!!!!!!!!"
9,"I spent quite some time researching and trying to find a pocket knife that I liked that was made in the USA.  Unfortunately the information about that is very sketchy online.  This one doesn't say it anywhere. so I took a chance and got lucky that it had the Portland. OR stamp on the blade.  I have been using it for several months now and have absolutely no complaints about it.  I love the cut outs on the blade for one handed opening vs. the typical thumb posts.  It fits in my pocket very well and was extremely well sharpened when it arrived."
9,"Everlast is a well known name and they make good products.  I wanted something cushy for my exercise class so something a bit more thicker than a yoga mat.  This is definitely thick and cushy.  But.... it's kind of bulky and heavy to carry.  It does have handles but it is still kind of cumbersome and I am pretty strong.  It was not worth returning so I will deal with it.  But if I had to do it over. I'd buy the yoga mat."
6,"What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain. cylindrical body. a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap. and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests. but they do put ink on paper. and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that. these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat."
3,"This was a fast paced tale.  It started off so innocently in the Holy Land with a pleasant trip with just a hint of something wrong.  Greg's  senses were picking up little nuances. but couldn't quite put a finger on what was bothering him.  Just too many coincidences.  After they got home. the fun started.  With Jill kidnapped he had to pull out all the stops and call in every favor he could.  As this is the beginning of the series. it made you think a little harder.  Loved the relationship and the genuine love between them.  A great read.  Recommend reading all this series."
4,"I started kickboxing with this video. only to find it too challenging.  Though Kathy instructs you on careful and precise movements and good posture. you are really better off going to a class first where someone not  only instructs you but checks that you are doing the moves correctly.  However. after learning how to do the moves correctly. this video is  excellent. though occasionally repetitive.  Kathy and her friend can be a  little bit annoying. but once you break a sweat. they are the last thing  you're thinking about!"
2,"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock. and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all. but I've really been craving sorbet. and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix. but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours. only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."
12,"This game had the potential to be great. but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with. as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game. If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games. or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations. than you just may be good to go. but you can easily take a lot of damage. and you can't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games. or Quake. If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you. then go ahead and play this. but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements. I think you are better off playing Doom 3. Silent Hill. the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3.These are my two cents."
1,"I had a HUGE newly healed scrape that took up half my forearm and it was starting to scar up in a weird bumpy way.  I wasn't sure if this was really going to work because reviews seemed mixed. but it sounded like the newer the scar is. the better it works.  Honestly. I've been using it for a few weeks (I try for once a day. but I occasionally forget) and the results are AMAZING.  It literally looks better every day.  The weird bump &#34;over scarring&#34; areas were gone after TWO days.  Now my scar had JUST healed.  I started applying it a few days after the last of the scabbing had gone. so I suspect that's why I've had such great luck."
7,"It worked great for one season but when I went to start it up for this season it wouldn't start. I did everything the manual and website said to do when I put it away last fall and did everything the manual and website said to start it up this spring. including wasting three of the 'clean out' cartridges and it still doesn't work. Plan on buying a new one every year if this is the one you choose.  Their tech support does not answer emails and the wait for them to answer the phone is nearly endless.Bottom line: avoid this product."
8,"My little boxer-pit bull mix has chewed through every 'durable' toy there is.  I got her the 'wolf' size Galileo and had to help her start it (it's slippery before they scratch it up) but now she loves it.  If you have a dog that can chew the other durable Nylabone products down to a nub then this is for you!  It doesn't even seem to matter that it's not flavored (at least not to my knowledge).  I would also recommend the Nylabone Double Action Chew - this one has also lasted far longer then the Nylabone durable regular bones."
7,"Though I have several string trimmers. there are areas best cut by hand - like around the vines climbing the two metal arbors out front. If I accidentally cut those vines. I'll be in big trouble. and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks.  The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well. and though I only use them a few times a year. they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely."
2,"This coffee maker makes good coffee. but all the little parts. which don't fit together quite right will make you crazy.  This is a pain to clean.  The basket is large and over time became more difficult to remove.  After a few months. I couldn't get it out. even with a pliers.  Also after a couple of months the automatic drip control broke off. when trying to remove the basket.  I emailed the vendor several times more repair or a replacement part...no response.  Now that the machine hasn't been cleaned properly for a few months the coffee doesn't taste that good.  In the trash it goes.  The machine also 'beeps' at you a lot....like I need one more complaint!  Good coffee. but needs design tweaks and customer service improvement."
4,"Well. the title explains it. The title is extremely pointless. Why? Why? Why? Why did Toho have to make such a stupid film???! There are some changes they should have made. First. aliens. Why aliens? It is waaaay to corny. Second. Ghidrah. Way did Toho make Ghidrah look like he was a drunken elf? Ghidrah didn't have to shake his legs. heads. and wings uncontrolably! And third. MAKE GODZILLA AND THE OTHER MONSTERS GOOD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've given this movie five stars if Godzilla wasn't good! That mistake made the rest of the Showa series dumb. In the later movies. Godzilla acts more like Barney than a giant monster."
1,"While there is nothing wrong with the product. I am APPALLED by the magnitude of over-pricing on Band-Aid branded bandages. I am not blaming the retailers. I have also noticed that Band-Aid seems to be &#34;eliminating&#34; competing generic offerings. especially if they are in similarly sized boxes.Right after I received this I found packages of generic bandages with 100 total strips of assorted sizes at Walmart for 88 cents. That's $0.88! I checked several Walmarts BEFORE I ordered Band-Aid. but there was no better generic offerings. it was only AFTER ordering that I found them.Nonetheless. I don't have a &#34;good reason&#34; to return these (oh. I would. if I could. but it's not the seller's fault. so I don't want to make them take losses on S&H;). but I will be avoiding Band-Aid brand with even more resolve now."
7,"I sure do love having this set in my shed.  I've used the blower extensively and the weed-whacker extensively.  I've never used the hedge trimmer. so I can't comment on that.Some perks..* it comes with two rechargeable batteries. which is super handy for heavy work days.  The battery charger also holds/chargers both batteries at the same time. Bonus.* Lightweight.  I never felt worn out carrying any of these around the lawn.* A wall mount with hooks comes with the set. So. I was able to hang these all neatly in my shed. just like in the photo.* Durable. good B&D; quality.The only bummer I've found with this set is that the leaf blower sucks the life out of the rechargeable batteries rather quickly.  So. don't dawdle when using the leaf blower."
3,"This is not my first time reading this collection. I have the paperback copies that I have kept over the years. It is a totally engrossing set of books. Maggie Shayne is one of my favorite paranormal authors. one that I can be sure when I pick up one of her books. I will enjoy it.Wings in the Night. Part 1 contains six wonderful tales about the creatures of the night known as vampires. I read that Maggie's line of vampire stories are the original ones. the ones that came before. You will see they are people just like you and me. You'll fall in love at least once. Maybe more.If you like paranormal romance. get this collection. You won't be disappointed. All I was disappointed in was that I couldn't give it more than five stars. I am looking forward to obtaining more of her books for the Kindle or Nook."
7,"I like the fact that Deer Off is all-natural or I wouldn't have used it.  It comes with a battery-operated sprayer that works fairly well and delivers a good stream.  I walked twice around my garden while spraying a steady stream of Deer off around the perimeter.  The sprayer should be flushed out with clean water after each use.The odor around my garden wasn't unpleasant to me.  An application is supposed to last for 90 days but long before 90 days I saw rabbits in the garden.  On the plus side I haven't seen any signs of deer in the garden. and they potentially eat a lot more than rabbits.So it's effectiveness is inconclusive but at least it doesn't hurt to try."
12,"Are you joking. This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion. Man. are you guys even trying anymore?  I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh. you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics. horrible gameplay. sucky battle system. hard to understand. VERY difficult to get into it. too confusing. dumbxxx characters like cloud. hes the worst.(except sephiroth). sometimes too long of cutscenes. boring cutscenes. you can barely see their eyes &amp; mouth. etc. etc. etc. etc. times a million.I hate this game."
2,"This little Eureka vac works well for me to pick up cat litter. crumbs. and easily tackles quick clean ups on the hard surface floors around my home. It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces; I've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time. On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards. I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go. I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space. The beater brush setting can be on on or off. The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum. Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet."
9,"Speedo makes great goggles with great quality.  I usually buy a pair every year or two to replace older ones that I have scratched up and or stretched out...yes I have a big head.  :-)That said I figure I would try a pair of these.  True to form. they are perfect goggles and very high quality.  Not much else can be said.I rate them 5/5 but with a hint of CAUTION!If you are ok with wearing what seems like a pair of sunglasses under water..then these are for you.  They do in fact block sunlight and make the experience a bit better during the bright mid afternoon but they do darken things up quite a bit  Just a note....in the end its your choice."
7,"This charcoal slow-cooker & smoker does everything as advertised.  It is well made and easy to assemble.  I have done 2 cooks so far (baby back ribs. chicken. sirloin tip & salmon).  As long as you don't keep adding smoke-wood. but only do it at the beginning (and do it sparingly) you will have well cooked and flavorful food.  I recommend trying the 'best ribs in the universe' procedure for your first cook - found at [...]  I highly recommend this cooker and think you will do the same.  P.S. - Amazon.com has about the best prices and delivery you will find around."
4,"This movie will make you laugh til you cry. it really is hilarious from beginning to end. Woody Allen is at his best in this film that he also directed.I'm giving it 4 stars as I did not like Janet Margolin as his girlfriend in this movie. thought a better choice could have been made to play this role. She seemed to be reading the lines throughout. not breathing any life into the role.Other than that. loved everything about this film. A great pick me up if you've had a bad day and need some big laughs. This one is a keeper!"
9,"This griddle is well made. and built to last. Provided you take care of it. like you should for anything cast iron.Even though it is pre-seasoned. I went ahead and seasoned it again anyway. It can't hurt.This is one item that will be in my camping gear for a long time to come. and works just great. Flipped some pancakes on it one morning. and they couldn't have been better. Also made some reuben's. and it toasted each side flawlessly.If you need a cast iron griddle. don't hesitate to pick this one up."
6,"Those of us who've used a i950 don't need to be told that they drink ink like... I don't know... like how a thirsty something drinks water. In my case. this has been a good incentive to think twice before I go to print anything. Now. this set is a true price break from what I was used to. I don't really need an 8-pack but I did get one once. by mistake and I had no problem with the i950. I just ended up with 2 extra cartridges.It's low price. free shipping... if this was a grocery item. I'd probably set it up as an Amazon subscription. If anyone is aware of a better deal anywhere - it's got to be genuine Canon ink - please leave a comment to this review and I will be more than grateful."
3,"Novella length urban fantasy along the lines of Butcher's Dresden.I like this authors style. It has such a devil may care attitude to it and that is exactly how he has written his main character. With the debonnaire flair of  an outcast gentleman and the sarcastic wit of a person who doesn't give a flying monkey what anyone says or thinks.A few minor errors. one being the use of the word reign instead of reins.Other than that this is quite an excellent read. just a shame it isn't a full length novel. Saying that though novellas often feel 'interrupted' for wont of a better word and this doesn't. it fits snugly and ends well. Like the first cup of coffee in the morning.It just feels right.AVP-UK"
9,"The AirZooka is a rather large toy that launches a blast of air up to 20' or so. We gave this to my son for Christmas and it turned out to be a surprise hit! The AirZooka was a little hard for my son to assemble on his own. but he was eventually able to get it.Everyone (young and old) had a lot of fun playing with this toy and the cats soon learned to go upstairs when anyone picked it up (Note: No animals were harmed in the writing of this review :-)Recommended!"
11,"Without repeating what has already been said in other reviews. I simply want to add to the advice that this game is for hardcore Simpsons fans.  I thought I was one...until I played this game.  I have watched the Simpsons since the early 90's and have seen most episodes at least 4-5 times.  This game was still very difficult for me. I thought that I would be able to play it with my kids (10 and 5) who watch the Simpsons with me. but it was really to difficult for them. However. I enjoyed watching the clips and it's a great collectible for serious fans.  I also got it for a fantastic price on Amazon. so no regrets!"
3,"I was hooked from the very beginning of this story. The character of Robyn is a fantastic underdog. You want her to overcome all of the pain she's gone through in her young 18 years. The beginning of this story is an intense journey for Robyn. as well as the reader. As the story goes on. it seems to become a bit predictable.I personally wasn't a fan of Trigg as a character. I think I would have liked a little more backstory on him. in hopes of having more of a connection with him. I love the premise behind the Watchers. and am thrilled to see there are so many more Watchers books out these. I enjoyed the brief glimpses we had of the other Watchers. and I think I will love the following books!"
11,"For players who like a meaty game. Talisman will give you hours of fun time. A typical game can last over two hours and the rules are more complicated than Monopoly but it isn't hard to master. For a modest investment in learning the game. you can have many afternoons and evenings of fun with kids age 10 and up. great for adults getting together for a game night as well. We play with all adults. mixed kids and adults. and all games are fun.The large number of cards and races make for varied reply and the available expansions are well worth addeding for new races. cards and regions. There is a random component to the game but the focus is more on steady advancement of your character which favors good play over luck.For those who play RPGs. this game could be considered 'D&D; lite'. a good way to get a fantasy gaming fix in when you can't get your regular group together.Materials are sturdy and the game holds up to lots of use."
1,"We got a new point and shoot camera. and it was chewing up regular brand name AA's like they were going out of style.  Discovered these at the local big box store and decided to give them a try.  Wow.  In the name of full disclosure. they cost more than a standard pack of batteries might.  But let's face it. you don't want the camera conking out prematurely at the championship soccer game or that once in a lifetime vacation.  I simply can't recommend these Lithium Energizers enough."
11,"This ship is probably one of the most important ships for the rebel side in the game. and almost all competitive rebel squadron lists have at least one. in fact the world champion used two X-wings and two B-wings. It does come in the Core Set bu this expansion has some very nice cards that add to the lethality of the X-wing. Mostly the usefulness is the two named pilots Wedge and Garvin. both are good with Wedge being the more useful of the two. The upgrades are decent with the highlights being the Astromechs.Whether it comes from this expansion. the Core Set. or the Rebel Transport the X-wing is a good ship. but all come with the different pilots that make it a great ship and I recommend picking up this expansion especially if you want to fly rebels."
3,"I have read three of this author's books and so when I came across this one I decided to give it a go. It's a romance book which is not my thing but...to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised.Despite it having your typical love secenes (attraction. break up. apology) and emotions (oh how could he. I hate him etc). I particularly like the author's approach. It's not a lovey-dovey story where everything turns out well (as is the case with most romance books). It's a story about genuine love and sacrifice in the name of love. It's a story about a woman who finally wakes up and smells the coffee after being bogged down for so long. And this is the aspect that I love the most. The ending is left hanging so noone knows what happens but....still a good read."
1,"I've been a user of Braun electric shavers for over 5 years. I recently upgraded to a new model and I have been noticing that the Clean & Renew cartridges have a shorter life span. from about 3 months to less than 2 months. not sure if it has to do with the new shaver using more cleaning product or that Braun changed the formula and it now has a higher evaporation point. I keep monitoring and researching around to see if I'm the only one. but so far I give it only 3 stars because of thisBut the Frustrarion Free Pack is great. it greatly reduces the amount of useless cardboard and excess material. Good job there!"
12,"There always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered! Zelda is one of those games .its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun!!!!!!!!!!! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection.one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around."
6,"The gel rest is comfortable.  However if you look at the picture closely. the pad is actually a bit thinner 4/3rd of the way to the left. I think the designer's ideal is to make the thickest part near the number pad on the right side..But the problem is that number pad is least used part of the keyboard. and when my hand rest on &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; key the right side gets a lot less coverage than the left side. and feel very unbalanced."
6,"I see too many negative comments. It's 5 bucks. How powerful of a book stand do you want for 5 bucks? No it doesn't lock. No it doesn't hold 2000 page dictionaries. However....Yes. it's 5 bucks....Yes. it holds a college books....Yes. it stays still (even without a lock!). Good stuff for 5 bucks. It holds a book.If you're thinking this will hold a large book. it won't. A large hardcover book. like a certification book. would have to be less than 400 pages to fit in here. The only way it would fit a large dictionary. as pictured. would be if you opened it to the middle page and never wanted to read any place else."
2,"I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go. I really like how fast it makes ice cream. I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out. Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl. So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream. The texture is just right when its finished. I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer. So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy"
11,"This is the Non-Deluxe Edition of the awesome game. Munchkin. It has all the same stuff as the Deluxe edition. save for the board. the figures. and the female/male cards. Although you can play without all those things. I would not suggest it as it gets very confusing very fast. The game is a bit difficult to master. but it is well worth your time and effort! The monsters are hilarious and the rules are obscure so indulge in some healthy arguments as you play. It's good practice for your next friendly facebook debate over the superiority of certain ice cream flavors as well as your stance on current gun control legislation.Bottom line: go get this and learn how to play it! It's worth your time. Heads-up. you'll need 3-6 players. so go make two friends before making your purchase. (SIDE NOTE: If you're having any trouble learning how to play. go watch TableTop on youtube.)"
4,"The film has it's own value. but some people underestimate the work by the team that made all of these films. todays CGI animation is great but the quality of such recent CGI hits in theatres wouldn't be there if this team never existed. The blazed the trail the same way Lewis and Clark blazed the trail across the united states and the work in all these films proves it because of how the stand the test of time. Besides. the cast of these films in beyond stellar they are legendary. Not &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF TTHE BOARD&#34; was in one along with other ledgends and if it's good for &#34;THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD&#34; it perfect for my household."
8,"My dog LOVES heat so I thought this would be perfect to put in her cage while we are at work. I buried it underneath the blankets. and had the blue cover over it. She ripped off the blue cover and chewed all the way around the warmer. and punctured it so I can't use it at all.Now I'm stuck with the blue cover. paw print cover. and dog stuffed animal.The warmer is a lot harder than I thought it was. so I can see how some dogs wouldn't find it very comfortable to lay on. but if you use the stuffed animal the heat doesn't go through it very well.The one good thing is I was surprised at how long it stayed warm."
12,"Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find. but that effort has a very good reward. 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...). it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes. I know that graphics... forget about the graphics. 'cuz first. it's the N64. and second. graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64. and you don't have already MK64. you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness)."
9,"I found that these were really useful when used in a quiet environment with loud sounds that come periodically. like a gun range. When worn with ear plugs. they amplify speech so you can hear conversations in between shots or bangs.However. when used in an area with high ambient noise (engine room. construction site). they function about the same as regular earmuffs because the amplified audio cannot be heard over the ambient noise.Pros: Works well for the rangeCons: Doesn't work well for areas with high levels of ambient noiseOverall: 3/5 starsI recommend using rechargeable batteries."
12,"When you first buy this game. you will need to give it time. Reading the  Manual first just might be alot of help. The game starts out in pause mode.  This gives you time to zone space for roads. residental &amp; commercial or  indutry zones. water pipes and electrical wires. It times take to know the  best way to zone RCIs. It's not easy and money can disappear fast so don't  go crazy zoning everything and destorying things. it will cost you. It sum  this review in one sentence. It takes time to build a perfect city so try  different approaches and eventually your get it right."
9,"It didn't clean my hands. which weren't very dirty in the first place and it ruined my hair.Maybe it's just me. but I tried one *drop* for washing my hair. Even pre-mixed it with warm water. No amount of rinsing could get it out of my hair. It left my hair all greasy/oily. My hair was cleaner before I put this horrid stuff in it!Had to re-wash a FEW times with regular shampoo to get it all out.Now I don't dare use it on anything else. It's awful. Sitting on a shelf collecting dust."
6,"You can't go wrong with Avery.  They are the masters of the office products genre.  And these labels are no exception.  They are perfect.If you are doing a mass mailing. and don't want to print out envelope by envelope. here is the solution.  If you so choose. they. of course. can also be used for individual mailing.They are 1' x 2-5/8' and very appropriate for No. 10 or smaller envelopes.  Tasteful but unobtrusive size-wise.  They peel off easily and adhere easily.  They also adhere securely.This is a great find for me as I have a mass mailing of my own to do and was wondering just how to handle posting the addressee without labels appearing to make the mailing look like it could be bulk mail.  These don't appear that way and I think they are perfect for their purpose."
9,"This SOG 'Flash II' pocket knife is an excellent 'every day' carry knife. While I personally prefer theGerber 22-47162 Fast Draw Spring Assisted Opening Stainless Steel Fine Edge Knife. my son did not due to the weight so we found someone that was willing to trade the SOG for the Gerber. Here are my observations:Pros:+ Quality; this is a well made knife that will hold up to daily use quite well+ Speed; opens one-handed quite quickly+ Blade; comes razor sharp and holds an edge quite well+ Pock Clip; very sturdy. no worries at+ Positive Locks; this locks open/closed with a sliding buttonMisc:* Weight; this a very light knife compared to my other pocketknives. I prefer a little more heft but (as noted above) my son doesn't. so this is a matter of personal preferenceAn all around good knife at a reasonable price!Highly Recommended!CFH"
12,"Although the graphics arent as good as one would expect. the characters are very well done.  Espeically Sephiroth. he seems to be the very essence of evil with the tricks he pulls of in the game.  Many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the mini-battle game available in the Golden Saucer. also why didnt they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript?  This was probably to save money so Square wouldnt have to hire voice actors. Although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written story."
4,"I have to admit. I cried in the movie theater. at least twice. The guy next to my boyfriend wept like a repenting sinner. people cleared their noses and throats. They clasped their mouths.The brutal portrayal of Jesus's last 12 hours were gory. unhuman. bloody. tragic. and filled me with sorrow and love for him.It was an amazing movie. and the cast was perfect for it. A must see for anyone appreciating the deep topics.I think in a funny way. this hollywood production made me feel closer to God. it did not make me think any less of Jewish people. and it made me cry deeply when I got home. to let those emotions that I bottled up during the showtime. free.Go see it. I think everyone should."
12,"If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game. All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts. It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere. Even if this game was a buck it's so bad it couldn't even be a novelty. People who know this game might even make fun of you. Anyways I don't think there will ever be a good superman game it's sad."
8,"My kittens love this food and they certainly seem to be growing at healthy rate. My adult male cat doesn't really eat it but he's always preferred dry food so I buy this for the younger ones and their mother.  Mom and the litter were abandoned so I'm not sure what she was fed before but she seems to really like the food and its put some much needed weight on her. They seem to really like this flavor and the beef and chicken. Both are a bit smellier and oiler then the others but that's probably what they like."
7,"I live in one of those communities that have common grounds which are kept up by a service; as a result. I only have to tend the grounds in and around my house.  I used to have to lug a power cord out to do it.  With this device. though. I can charge it up overnight and then bounce outside for perhaps 3 minutes of effort at the most.  You have not experienced convenience until you've had the luxury of no gas and pullcord startup or long troublesome power cord. just a battery powered tool.  It is definitely not for large estates. but for simple short jobs. it is perfect."
8,"My box was definitely genuine because I bought it at Costco. Did NOT get rid of adult fleas and the infestation is as bad or worse as ever. I have to find something that works because my pets are miserable and the house has fleas now too. Too bad these medications are all becoming useless. They used to work so well. Does anyone know which one actually works nowadays. All these meds are way too expensive to fool around with duds. I need something that works and is safe for my dog."
4,"We all know the story of Jesus Christ. He lived as a human and committed no sin. He was the perfect man. Because of this he was able to settle the debt we have built with our sins buy acting as a human sacrifice. This movie gives us a look at how his final hours may have transpired. It's very powerful and very upsetting.This is an incredible movie. It is passionate. as the title suggests. and very realistic. The acting is perfect and the message is timeless. Whether you believe that Jesus was the son of God or not. you can appreciate the passion and love he had for his fellow man. It's amazing to think that he endured what he did as a human. when he also possessed the power of God. If you can handle the brutality and emotional toll this film will take on you. I strongly recommend it. Be ye warned! It's extremely graphic and hard not to look away from at times."
12,"My favorite character is Sephiroth.He also makes an appearance in &quot;kingdom Hearts&quot; as the toughest boss in the game.(but i beat him!)Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mind-blowing game.Cloud is the main character of this game.He also makes an appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as 3 or 4 bosses.he's easy.The thing is.I couldn't even get past the mechanical scorpion!The game is just way too hard for me.But I beat it.The Sephiroth's are also Hard.If you're in for some action.buy this.Cloud is just such an amzig character.and so is Sephiroth.sincerly.kenny"
7,"After chasing food around the typical round metal & wood skewers for quite a while I decided to go on the hunt for a better skewer. and I found them! The 'flat vs round' design allows whatever food you have on them to stay in place so that everything cooks evenly. The point. although sharp is not overly so but still sharp enough to easily pierce raw meat and the 18' length gives you plenty of room to 'load em' down with goodies or space the food out whichever suits the food being grilled. The loop handle makes it easier to grasp the skewers with a mit or tongs.A previous reviewer mentioned the 18' length and I'll agree depending upon your grill this length may be a bit long and they may be a tad better 2' shorter [that reviewer just cut his to fit].I gave these skewers 5 stars as I don't anticipate having to find anything better for kabobs!"
11,"This game really hit the mark for in a lot of different areas. It has really nice art work. cool plastic miniatures. play is fast and exciting. and the rules are clearly written. The board is really nice. and well designed. The rule book was easy to understand and walk through to figure out the game. The rules themselves are pretty simple and easy to teach (always a big consideration for me. since I usually am the one teaching the game to others). The games don't take too long or bog down. and there is a great tension between escaping the pyramid or sticking around to try and gather more. but risking getting trapped inside. I would recommend this as a fun family game or as a light break between more intense games. if you have a serious gaming group."
8,"Current version of littermaid does not work well at all. The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it. The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original. The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version (on Amazon). It worked for six days and then died. It was replaced at no charge. The second one worked for six weeks and then died. I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase. So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product. This system forced me to give this product at least one star. I would give it -5 if I could."
6,"This is not of the same quality as the Kensington foot rest.  I now have both it and this one.It is a smaller version and does not have the same range of motion and comfortable gel foot pads.BUT. it is far cheaper.So in balancing the function versus the price it is a very acceptable solution to leg pain when working for prolonged periods at a computer desk.I was needing another foot rest at my L shaped computer desk but did not want to pay the high price of the Kensington model.When balancing the cost and usability of this foot rest I am pleased with my purchase.  It provides most of the same qualities of the more expensive options.  It is worth the price asked and I find it to be restful."
11,"I love having a stripped down version of the game for the kids or new players that get intimidated with how crazy the original can get with new rules and Creepers.  My kids love it and they don't need to read the cards as much as the pictures are fairly self-explanatory.  This might also make a good large expansion to throw in your original Fluxx game. though it might make some of it too easy and some of the new rules don't won't make sense unless you are playing with your family."
2,"Yes. upfront I'll say it's a little noisy. but that kind of goes with the territory.  Works perfectly. just as described in the directions.  I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.  It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.  Makes great ice cream. ice milk. bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.  Once you do that you may never make it any other way.  Once you price the ingredients. I cannot honestly say making ice cream is all that much cheaper than buying it. but the quality is far superior to store bought. and you have the added bonus of knowing exactly what is in your ice cream."
1,"I have used Superfloss for years- this new version is a caricature of the original product.What's wrong with it?1- the threader part used to be longer & stiffer. thus making it easy to pass the floss under permanent bridgework. especially those of molars way at the back of the mouth. Now it's short. flimsy. & bends so easily. it doesn't do the job it was designed to accomplish2- the floss portion used to be much thicker. fluffier & stronger. Now it is a mere shadow of itself. and as such is totally useless. And. it shreds!I had read the poor reviews. and always try to keep an open mind. Now I know that the poor reviews are spot-on.  This stuff is worthless. Do not waste your money. Regular floss used in conjunction with individual threaders is a much better solution."
9,"This knife is so handy. When I first received it I thought it was so small that I would loose it. I thought I would have to replace it right away. I am amazed that I have not lost it. The blade is very sharp. The scissors are very sharp too.The thing I use this the most for is opening packages in the car. after purchasing something in the store. It is a very sharp. sturdy for it's size and just a great little knife. I have had this knife about a year now and it is still in like-new condition. I highly recommend this knife."
6,"Although I have had the opportunity to use other brands through the Vine program. I am still very pleased with the price and performance of the Avery brand of labels.  I have never had an issue with these labels smudging or jamming in my laser printer.  I use these not only for address labels. but also for frequently used notes on packages (e.g. Fragile) and to label file folder boxes as well.  The templates to use create the data for the labels are included with Microsoft Word and make easy work out of getting them printed properly."
8,"No matter how good the nutritional value is. or how good it smells. it's no good if the dog won't eat it. and mine won't.  I am SO disappointed.  I tried mixing it in warm water to make a gravy.  Smelled great.  He hated it.  I then tried heating the &#34;gravy&#34; to really mix the powder into the HOT water.  I let it cool.  Put it on his food.  Hated it.  Next I tried it dry. just sprinkled on top.  He hated that. too.  The good news is that my brother's Rottweiler loves it.  But he loves anything!  I wanted this supplement because I am concerned about my fussy eater.  Unfortunately. it didn't help ME. at all."
4,"Surprised this didn't make a bigger release and it's only available in limited quantities from Twilight Time. I bought this after hearing this movie was based on a novel by Dauphne Du Maurier who also wrote the classic &#34;Rebecca&#34;. This movie I found is almost just as good as Rebecca and is basically about a man bewitched by a mysterious woman. Performances from Richard Burton and Olivia De Havilland are great and it contains maginificent Oscar Nominated black and white cinematography and a haunting score by Franz Waxman. I recommend this movie to all movie buffs and you better hurry and get it before it goes out of print."
11,"The board consists of a map of the world in old parchment color tones. Once you setup the board with your character standees. other world gates. monsters. and clue tokens. you get a sense of the adventure you're about to embark on. If you can get behind the below. this game is perfect for your gaming group:- Cthulhu / Lovecraft enthusiasts. or Arkham Horror board game enthusiasts- A small amount of setup but thematic rules make it easy to learn how to play- No plastic miniatures and few dice. but a lot of cards which contain the meat of your adventure- Ultimately a storytelling game through card play and strategy discussion amongst the players- Lots of fun and immersive mechanisms in the game such as having your investigators go insane or defeated. fighting monsters. going to other worlds. encountering and dealing with personal conditions/setbacks. improving skills and gaining items and allies.- Long game of about 3 hours with 4 players and even longer with the full 8 player game"
2,"I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many. many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps. It has sat out in broiling sun. freezing winter. pouring rain. and the worst that happened was that the color faded and it started looking a bit grungy. I was delighted to see that these were still available. and the new one looks just like the old one. but with brighter colors (and less dirt!) It should be good for another 20 years!"
2,"This is a great basic vacuum. It is great for my small apartment. I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood. I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off. My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose. That sliding mechanism is great. but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum. So. from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand. That said. i can always slap a piece of tape on that part. because otherwise this vac is so good. Suction is really great. Cant beat it for the price."
9,"I have discovered. through purchasing this pan to replace a different crepe pan. that I am crepe-handicapped. I tried. I really did to make beautiful crepes the likes of which I had in France all to no avail. Nothing to do with the pan and everything to do with me apparently. I do love this pan though. It is wonderful for pancakes and probably anything else you may want to cook. This is the lightest Lodge pan I own and it is so nice to work with. No hot spots. no cool spots just perfectly cooked pancakes that were made after my bitter dissapointment with the crepe batter. If you are not crepe-challenged (as I am) I highly recommend this pan. You cannot go wrong with lodge."
6,"I'm usually dissapointed in card makers but these are the best I have every used.  The paper looks much better right out of the box. works great in the printer. does not smear and most important gives you a photo-like image on the paper.They are a nice big size and come with their own envelopes (which is good since they are so big).  The images are really as good as premium photo paper when compared side by side.  They fold well. envelopes are good quality also.These might cost a little more than generic ones but well worth the price. cannot find one bad thing to say about them."
9,"Originally I had bought the Howard Leight Impact Sports electronic muffs but had to return them due to fit. I bought these to replace them and I really like them. The fit is really nice and they are comfortable. The noise cancellation works well too in outdoor and indoor ranges. I didn't find the battery compartment too difficult to get in to using a flat head screw driver. The negative thing I found was that the on/off button knob fell off when I first turned them on. Perhaps putting some locktite might help there."
11,"The game is great fun and has a different feel than most boardgames or euro-games out there. The first couple reviews were very thorough and they are accurate in their praise. If you like boardgames and you like Cthulhu. you will like this game. If you also like Lovecraft. you will LOVE this game. It is very horror based. and while the investigators can choose combat options. there is a lot going on that is pure horror based that has nothign at all to do with shooting things. Sure. as the keeper. I can summon all sorts of nasties to try to kill the crew. but its so much more gratifying to slowly drive them all insane and have them do the job for me! Very happy with the purchase."
9,"For pancakes. this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly. and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT. repeat. NOT to use any soap of any kind. sponge. steel wool pad. on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it. you can scrub the surface with a hot. clean water. handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning. pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap."
4,"Ben Carson was more then just a gifted surgeon. but a man who had drive and ambition within him that he did not even know he had.  His mother was a great influence in his life and it shows in this movie about Ben Carson's life.  If you really want to know what drives a man then you need to get the movie.  You will learn that what he said at the National Prayers Breakfast was real and that is why the media has since launched a campaign to keep him from advancing his philosophy on life."
9,"The issue I have with the CLUB CHAMP PUTT N' HAZZARD (sic) putting green is that every aspect of it feels cheaply made and likely to fall apart quickly. The back &#34;3D&#34; wrap-around uses Velcro and doesn't fit properly. It leaves gaps between the base and the wrap no matter how much I fiddled with it. The putting surface isn't bad at all. but needs a little ironing to lay flat. The ball return works well enough. The plastic cup. &#34;sand trap&#34; and &#34;water hazard&#34; are made of very thin plastic. Not durable at all. If you use this at your office. it will probably hold up. But if you have little kids like me. they'll destroy this thing pronto.Overall this putting green feels cheaply made. I'd look elsewhere."
2,"I'm very disappointed in this device. It's basically just a coat hanger with two plastic guides.  The only thing it has going for it is portability.  It can only hold regular sized hard covered books. Forget about any size paperback. it will not work. Even hard cover books are nearly impossible to align correctly and they slip and slump in all kinds of odd positions.  Then you have to completely remove the book from the stand every time you need to turn a page and try to realign it all over again.  I tried with over 10 textbooks and it didn't do well with any of them.  For home reading I'm going to buy and suggest you buy a more substantial stand. The only reason to keep it is to slip in a backpack and take with you and hope you have the desk space wherever you take it to use it."
12,"I love this game.  I love this game.  I love this game.  I just got Ocarina of Time and it's been a few years since it has come out - it still rocks even in comparison to what's out now.  I've had a Playstation 2 for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there. but after playing Ocarina of Time. I realize that I had forgotten the beauty of Nintendo games.  They just have a special feel to them (and they make me remember the years that I was a little tike playing old Nintendo games).  I just beat the game about 5 minutes ago.  I certainly won't spoil anything. but I will tell you that the ending is over 30 seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see...  A video game hasn't brought me this level of satisfaction in a while.  Bravo Nintendo. bravo."
11,"The Programmer Rover was a huge hit for my boys. one 9 average student and the other 10 who is in  accelerated/challenge classes.The instructions for the rover come in a laminated spiral bound book. very good as it is needed to be referred to often for every programmable action and therefore be built to last. The instruction booklet is well illustrated. the written instructions were clear and my nine year old was able to program the easier beginner tasks without a problem.Our boys and their friends spend hours playing with and programming the rover.  The Smart Lab ReCon Rover has turned out to be both an educational and fun electronic 'toy'. well worth the money. A++"
6,"For me. I prefer the college ruled notebooks and paper because it just plain holds more info and the notebook last longer. This Mead is top notch quality that I use in different colors and write with different pens and pencils. The paper is of excellent quality so that whatever pen or pencil I choose. the page is highly readable with no smears.This notebook is suitable for any age from young students to senior adults. And I have found these notebooks I keep records in and love to use them next to my computer when I take notes from my computer research.This is a must have spiral notebook as in my opinion. Mead is the BEST ONE!"
4,"I gave this one star to be polite. but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga. and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes. frankly). not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes. starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.&amp; Tone. Tot. Body Cond.. and Cond.&amp; Stress Relief. among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations. and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things."
1,"It's so soothing to the insides of my nose. Some types of weather makes my nose very dry and the AYR helps a lot. When my nose get too dry it might bleed when I blow it but because of the AYR it doesn't bleed as often. The only thing is that you will need Q-tips to apply the AYR. You could use your fingers but I wouldn't. You never know what's under them. no matter how much you wash your hands. I would recommend this to any one with this problem."
3,"Lady Amelia has decided to take a lover. Announcing it to her husband over breakfast probably wasn't the way to begin this adventure.Victoria Alexander has a way of making me laugh that no one else does! The antics of this husband and wife are truely hilarious. She really doesn't want a lover - just her husband's attention. He really doesn't want her to take a lover - but he offers to help. They both enlist the help of his twin brother and renowned rake in achieving their true goal.It really is one of the funniest books I've read in a very long time - and Victoria Alexander is always a favorite!"
2,"Without a doubt. this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift. but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).  It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.  Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.  Perhaps their freezers need adjusting?  In fact. after making ice cream (about 20 minutes) my bowl is still mostly frozen.Recipes do not seem to be as important as when baking. so don't be afraid to try something innovative.  Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it. then improvise.We are healthy eaters.  It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.  It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!"
6,"I don't know how Avery continues to improve on products that seem to work so well. but they manage to find ways to tweak their labels to make them even easier to use.These labels work as promised - no jamming in my printer. the print is legible and clean. and the labels peel off like magic. I've used Avery products for years and I'm never disappointed. These labels are no exception. They zip out of my printer in a jiffy. and the labels are great to use on all sorts of packaging. I ship a lot of things in the craft bubble mailers. and these labels stick like a charm."
1,"I sweat a lot. for no reason! I was limited to wearing black or white shirts because of the constant wet pit stains. Someone recommended this to me. and I'm so glad I bought it. It's really been a miracle product! I've tried those 'clinical strength' antiperspirants. and they do help a little. but nothing like this. I absolutely cannot believe how effective it is. even on my 'faucet pits!' I was nervous just applying it at bedtime and nothing in the morning. but I followed the directions diligently and it did what it said it would! And no BO during the day either! My ONLY small complaint is that it made my pits extremely itchy for the first few nights I used it. but that stopped after about 4-5 days. I swear it seals your pits shuts. I will never buy a different antiperspirant!"
4,"The Most conteversal film of the year is also one of the best. a brilliant but tragic film. I Still liked Braveheart better .but this is a triumph for Mel Gibson. I saw this movie in theaters and this is the first movie I've seen in another language and english subtitles. This film is one of highest grossing movies of the year. I recommend this movie. you might think it will be boring. so did I .but once I saw it really wasn't boring. If your into gripping epics. then this is a great one. If your only into happy feel good movies then of course ignore this one. If you liked Braveheart I say see this too. experience the Grace. the Power. the Passion of this gripping epic starring Jim Caviezel."
3,"These stories were just not on a par with the original. TWILIGHT PHANTASIES. and I was so disappointed.  Now this is just my take on this.  Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley.  I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me.  Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they don't have as many skills.  Also. they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright.  Just off somehow."
1,"This bottle brush has a flexible handle and even fits into bottles with very small spouts (1' or 1.5'. I'm not sure).  I use this to clean out my bottles weekly and am very happy with this purchase.  I chose to purchase this specific bottle brush because it is so highly-reviewed.  I bought this to replace a former bottle-brush. whose bristles were attached to the stem with wire (so they got bent out of shape).  I really prefer this one. it cleans so well. stays clean. and seems indestructible!"
4,"I loved this story about Joseph. It's one of my favourite stories in the Old Testament. I felt the actors brought this very important story to life in a manner that was refreshing and interesting. The direction was very good. the costumes inhanced the film. and acting was top notch. I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way. It's close to Scripture without being confusing and perfect for those who are beginners and delightful for those who aren't."
3,"I tried this book because I wanted something light and happy for this Christmas season.  I was very surprised to find it concerned an older hotel in San Francisco. one of my most favorite cities.  The heroine was a strong woman and she meets a man who is instantly attracted to her.  She is a little klutzy but all sorts of fun.  Personally. I can relate to that. I read this book I one short evening and think you'd enjoy this romance too.  If nothing else. it is a little different from the usual Contemporary Romance.  Happy Reading!"
3,"Girls this book is hot and sexy. After reading and laughing at some of the reviews. I really am stumped for what more to say about this book. Chick-lit this book is not. but from a chick-porn perspective it is pretty good! This book is short but that is a good thing. I don't need drama with my chick-porn. Marie Harte gives you just enough to be vested in the characters of this book without dragging out the story and a fine job of it! Check out Derricks story by this author. it is good too."
3,"The storyline was very unique.  I am not going into the plot. because others have described it.  What I DIDN'T LIKE. was our H was nothing but a bully and was very demeaning in the first half of the book towards our h.  What I LIKED about the story. was the sex.  it was raw. very imaginative. and hot.  There was somewhat of a  story. in between the sex.  I didn't feel a connection to any of the secondary character's to read the rest of the series.  The next book is only 96 pages and is $2.99. at least this one was free. (ljb)"
2,"Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far. So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem. This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air. It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler. As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate. It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise. But for the price it does a good job. One thing however is that this fan scares my cats. It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review"
12,"Now u can have all of the classic games on ur ps1. It has many things to do on it unstead of just playing the original arcade game. What u can do is walk around the museum and look at all of the game rooms or just explore and see what is there. Each room that u walk in that is a game has a really cool movie clip before u play them. There is this one room that tells u all of the info about games and when they came out and how popular they were. Which is awsome to learn about it. The graphics in the museum r great for the ps1 but when u play the arcade games they got changed from the original by a tiny bit and the music is more clear. It has many of the classics that u can play single or multiplayer on which is fun. When u get this game dont think all there is is the arcade games in it. there is much more than that. It is an awsome game."
6,"These are the standard size/weight address labels. There's really not any way to make these exciting. but then again. do you really want excitement from an address label? These are exactly what you expect. and I have to say I really do prefer the name brand labels to the office store brands. They just seem to feed & stick more reliably.These feed easily in both the drawer and tray of my laser printer. peel cleanly (the non-label backing is already off the waxy paper. so removing them from the backing is super easy.I also really like that the label/template number is printed right on the label so you don't have to hunt down the package to generate the appropriate template. Finally. I like the box. It's sturdy corrugated with a flip-top lid so the lid won't go astray and the labels stay in the box. even if it's sideways on as shelf.Mine came with a sample of note tabs. a nice extra bonus."
4,"I watched The Passion at my church saturday night.  This was the second time.  The first was when it came out and it was a lot to take in.  This time it was different.  It was far more spiritual the second time - a year later.Being done in the language of the day is HUGE.  Both times I saw the movie I got the feeling that I was actually witnessing the day Christ was crucified.  Now when i see movies about Christ that are in English I have trouble connecting with them and somewhat even taking them seriously.I suggest that anyone. who thinks that Christ did not take on the sins of the world. should see this film with an open heart and mind."
6,"The folder labels are fine. but only time will tell how well they stick. I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD). but when you print or go to print preview. you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label. particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution. but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out."
6,"This is an excellent product that makes an ordinarily tedious job much easier.  The trick is the 'Easy Apply label strips.' which allow you to print all five index tab labels at one time using a Word template that Avery makes available online.  Once they're printed. you just peel the group of labels off of the sheet and press the labels onto the folder tabs.  There's also a set of individual labels if you don't need sets of five.  It takes less time to do it than it takes to read this explanation.  The dividers themselves seem very sturdy. and they should survive pretty rough handling in a notebook.A new way of doing divider tab labels isn't going to change the world. but this Avery product makes life just a little easier.  Bottom line:  Well worth the money."
4,"I loved this movie. it would be a GREAT movie to show to a Youth group at church as I believe this movie teaches not only about Hosea. but it has a GREAT message about acceptance and how we all are going through things at one time or another and how we should not judge others because of their seemingly standoffishness.... (if this is a word).... I was shy as a young teen. and was going through things at home.... had no friends and I could relate to this girl..... thank you Beverly Patton"
9,"Meh...I bought these when a &#34;friend&#34; said they were better than the Howard Leights.  They're not.They do the same job. but complicate the issue.  Instead of one battery compartment (like the HL's). there are two. one in each ear.Rather than a single volume control. you now have one for each ear.  Great if you're a geriatric with varied hearing capacities in either ear. but just a nuisance when you want them both on the same volume anyways.Changing the batteries is a PITA!  Just a really disappointing design. to be honest.  I'd recommend the HL's over these 100% of the time.  Same price and better design."
2,"One messy African Grey together with a kibble-strewing canine in a kitchen where bread is baked 3-4 times a week was driving me nuts. I was so tired of schlepping out the Dyson 2-3 times a day to vacuum the above mentioned mess. The Eureka Quick Up Cordless is my new best friend. It was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger. The bonus battery pack ensures there is always plenty of power to get the job done. Because the Eureka Quick Up wasn't designed to suck the chrome off a truck's fender. don't expect it to take the place of a traditional vacuum. For those little messes that make you tired of dragging out and plugging in the big guns. the Eureka Quick Up is friggin' awesome!"
2,"LOVE this ice cream maker.  I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are. Doesn't take up much room. It's the perfect size for my husband and me.  Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.  IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things. like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.  I admit I wasn't sure it would work the first time. it seemed too easy. but sure enough in 25 minutes we were in ice cream heaven.  We like to transfer the ice cream to a tupperware container and stick it in the freezer for an hour or so before eating so it's firmer. but if we can't wait....  I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.  We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something."
3,"I'm not sure where to go with this. The kindle formatting on this book is not good.  There are random carriage returns mid-sentence. no spaces between paragraphs or even chapters. And it's one of the most poetically well written novels I've read in some time.The writing is fairly stark and unadorned.  It gives the overall story a very gritty and dark feel that keeps it moving.  Even some of the random carriage returns help in this overall feel by giving it a poetic character that contrasts the grit and adds a little flavor.I would have given this 5-stars.  But. while some of the formatting flaws add to the story. there are just too many.  At the beginning they added to the story but after awhile I had to stop reading because they would more often disturb me than anything."
1,"Niacin is quite effective in reducing bad cholesterol in your blood. especially in my case. I am sensitive to most statin drugs prescribed by doctors.  The usual downside to it's regular use is flushing from dilating the blood vessels while it is being absorbed.  Slo Niacin has an enteric coating that slows the absorbtion. so that the &#34;flush&#34; is not a problem. It is important to watch the date on the product. as the enteric material loses some of it's effect with time. Slo Niacin is also much less costly than statin drugs."
3,"I very much enjoyed. It was sensual. and romantic.. Cal and Laurel were wonderfly done. I cheered for her through the entire story. A bit of mystery and a lost sole finding home. I could almost hear the wind in the trees. Miss Wildes painted such vivid pictures with her words.Will add Miss Wildes to my authors to watch.Storyline: outlaw romanceIntimacy: sensual. but not eroticEnjoyment: read with out stopping. did not want to stop for dinner.Book length: 41.000 wordsKindle length: na read in ePub format"
11,"I played this game once and was hooked! The rules are simple. You can modify it for kids. by. for example. not requiring their words to connect with each other. I like the speed. and in my family it's very social. True. during the game itself. you don't talk all that much--only groans of pain when you get a bad letter or get stuck and have to 'Dump' or wait for someone else to 'Peel.' Then there's the aftermath. where we critique each other's boards. make charges of cheating or bogus words. call each other 'Rotten Bananas.' etc.--all in great fun with lots of laughter. Scrabble can be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow--you could take a nap in a four person game while you await your turn. Takes about 10 minutes. max. This version of the game works for up to four people--for more than that I'd go for the double version. I love it!"
11,"I Love the idea of this but didn't like the story. We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect. I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is &#34;naughty&#34;. We will encourage striving for the &#34;nice&#34; behavior without threats. Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior? I really hope not so why make the threat. Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic..."
11,"This unique game requires one player on his turn to come up with a word or phrase which describes a picture in their hand. It could be one word. a phrase or a sentence. The other players pick a card from their hand which they think matches that word or phrase. The pictures are fanastical and engaging. Selected cards are mixed and placed face up on he table. Players then vote on which picture they believe was the one who spoke the word or phrase. Points are awarded accordingly. The player who chose the word wants at least one person to pick their card. but not everyone. I highly recommend this game!"
6,"This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen. If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear. Granted. when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images. If you are not constantly printing. the nozzles will clog. It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer. After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer. I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000. My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable!"
6,"I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping. and was very pleased with how it performed.First. it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape.  It has a subtle satin finish that just blends easily with ... well .. almost everything.  Second. it holds VERY securely.  If you're used to lesser tapes that let you carefully peel and reposition a flap. you'll soon find that this tape behaves differently.  Make sure you have things just where you want them before you stick down the tape.I would consider this a definite 'step up' from my old stand-by. Scotch Magic Tape.  Definitely outperforms it by a long shot."
1,"I received this last week.  I bought it to clean jars and glasses.  Does not feel flimsy. does a good job.  The last two bottle cleaners I bought in the grocery store were of appalling quality.  This is in a whole different class.. it works!  I expect to feel the same way next month.June 2012:  This little miracle lasted for more than a YEAR.  I finally retired the first one two months ago and am now using the second one.  Talk about value for money spent!"
7,"I swapped out my old plastic hummingbird feeders for this glass one because the plastic ones kept getting moldy and were so hard to clean properly. This one is the perfect size to hold 2 cups of homemade sugar syrup. which the birds love. It took a good few days to a week before the birds would use this feeder. I don't think they like the perches. as they loved my old feeders which didn't have perches. They don't seem to feed for as long on this feeder as my old feeders either. I also think they preferred my old feeders because they had the raised yellow flowers. this feeder has flat flowers which doesn't seem to attract them as much."
2,"I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years. It rolls easily and with the sharpness of the wheels blade it'll cut through just about any kind of pizza you want it to.The grip (like on all of the OXO Good Grip items) is excellent. and it is made to last. High quality construction. great blade. and grate grip. and great price. What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"I bought this a couple weeks ago to use to scrub up some stains out of our carpet and it has worked wonderfully. And while the bristles are delicate enough to not destroy a carpet. they are also robust enough to use to scrub a shower. sink or tub - I've used it for all of these. This is a bit more expensive than other bargain scrub brushes you might find. but the ergonomic grip really is worth it. If you are going to be using this for any extended period of time. your hands and wrist will feel the difference."
6,"These Avery labels are specially designed to coverup anything underneath them.  They call this TrueBlock. and if you want to be extra sure that nothing can be seen through the label you put on something then this is valuable.  If you don't need this then these labels would be an unnecessary expense in comparison to ordinary mailing labels.These labels are designed for laser printers. though you could also use them in an inkjet.  Just make sure you set the proper template in your word processor before printing.  These labels are something that I'll have available whenever I need to re-use a package/shipping envelope that has dark writing on it."
7,"Let me start by saying DO NOT BUY STINGER!!!  I bought 2 from Wally World and both are dead within a week.  I mean the light is barely visible already and it is no longer attracting insects.  I bought them because they were less expensive basically to save a buck.  I ended up throwing them away and buying 2 of these to replace them.I already have been using a Flowtron 1 Acre in one corner of my house for the past 4 years and it is on all the time.  It has been incredibly reliable and effective.  These are the only Electronic Insect Killers I recommend."
1,"I was afraid to order  after getting bootleg blades before online . These are the real deal as long as you use Amazon they should take them back no hassle if they weren't  . Amazon also sells  a in shower shaving mirror that helps make the blades last longer too .Deluxe Shave Well Fog Free Shower. It isn't truly fog free none of the are  but it works pretty well so far for me . You need to follow the directions of the company . Toothpaste works great to clean their mirror .  If I have a problem I will post in a review there but it has worked well just like these blades . Together my shaving experience is affordable and painless ."
7,"I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house. and I love them.  They are practically indestructable. and exceeds my expectations.  I have them hooked up to hoses. bypassing our water softener.  I also use the double connectorsGilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connectoras well. which are equally as good.  A must have for every home.I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors.  If corrosion does take place. it can become very difficult to unscrew it."
3,"This is quite a bit different from Volume 1.  The first few stories were written from the perspective of the criminal committing the crime which was somewhat different.  But enter Dr. Thorndyke and justice is served.  The author is somewhat of a loquacios writer in that 10 or 20 words are used when 1 or none would do.  But he really does set the scene.  The authors of mysteries always need to create the  crimes and clues to match the expertise of esoteric knowledge of the protagonist but some of the these stories are over the top. However they are still very interesting and impart facts that I wasn't aware of.  They are extremely fun and interesting reads and I will continue to search for more like them."
12,"Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission. the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench. in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though. After you hit your target it just says 'Mission Complete' They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied."
7,"I have a compost bin (two actually) and can't wait to use it in my garden this year! The Compost Plus seems to be making my compost material even better. richer. darker. I love this product! The only issue is that the directions say not to add paper to your compost. What??!! Doesn't everyone add paper? Well. I called the company and after a few passes around the office. I was told. then confirmed by another employee. that they don't want to have to list all the kinds of paper you can and shouldn't use in composting. So. they just wrote 'no paper' on their box. Easier for them I suppose. but I'm glad I called because I love adding old newspaper to mine.  Hope this helps! Happy composting!Sheri - writer. mom. mage"
8,"My cats got infested with fleas and I had a hard time getting them under control. as a result I had many outbreaks of tapeworm in my three cats.  The vet bills got expensive after awhile. and since I had learned to identify tapeworm infection. with some research. I deemed these safe.  I am an infectious disease researcher myself. so I do have some experience.  These do work. BUT please ALWAYS check with the veterinarian FIRST before you try to self treat your pets.  The wrong treatment for the wrong diagnosis can lead to damaging consequences."
7,"Said to be drinking safe. this cute little 4 ft hose is perfect for me as a split-off from the main faucet where I have the big hose. On a hot day I like to drink the really cold well water which comes out after garden-watering. The connections are tight. I always put a bit of Vaseline on washers at the beginning of the season. OR replace them with new rubber ones. I do this on sprayers as well. Maybe that's why I had no leakage problems."
4,"While the film was shot beautifully and the acting was fantastic. it did not help to overcome the hollow feeling this film left. Yes the violence was extreme. but in this regard it did more to hinder the emotion that was trying to be conveyed. There comes a point when it is TOO much. We. the audience. become desensitized and detached from what the filmmaker is trying to get across. In other words. the point is gotten across so much that we feel hit over the head with it. Whether you believe this stuff really happened or not (personally I do not). speaking from a film-only critique. it did more damage than good. And does anyone else find it a bit sad how they sell nails from the movie as necklace charms? Ugh! I'm sure if there is a Jesus. he wouldn't be so happy at a blatant grab for cash as opposed to helping a fellow man in need."
8,"I bought this product to stop the problem we were having with our 6 month old puppy. We have 5 little dogs that are paper trained. The product smells horrible to me. enough to make my stomach turn. I mixed it with canned food and all but one dog really loved it. I forced myself to tolerate the smell and continued to feed it to them for a couple of weeks once a day. It has helped to stop the problem even though one dog wouldn't eat it. I have stopped it for about a week now and it still seems to be working. I have my fingers crossed because I really don't want to smell it as I feed it anymore."
2,"Cutting bread without a bread knife is futile exercise. This bread knife works well and is very inexpensive. The blade is only about 8 inches. so it is not quite long enough to cut bread from a bread machine if the loaf is placed on its side.  I thought I had to get a longer knife. but then I figured I can stand the bread up so that it is much narrower.  That works. the knife is now long enough to cut very thin slices of bread that has about the same thickness as the Wonder sandwich bread that I used to buy in grocery stores."
9,"Kidding.  I've had the Classic SD for about 2 weeks now and am in love with it.  I bought it as a set along with the larger Tinker.  All tools function well.  My favorite is the toothpick.  The fingernale file comes in at a close second.  the little blade is sharp and workes well for its size.  This would be a usefull peice to add to a first aid kit. but this one travels in my pocket as my mini EDC.  Funny how quickly a small multi tool can become indespensible.  I rotate all my other blades. but this one is my constant companion.  Now if only they would add a corkscrew."
7,"I sprayed this on my yard. not to protect any of my greenery but to stop the squirrels from climbing up the wall and into the gutters and roof. So far. I can't tell if its the rain or the Havahart spray that stopped the squirrels but so far I haven't seen any squirrels running around in the general area. This leads me to believe its the rain that is shooing the squirrels away. I will save the rest of the Deer Off when spring time arrives or when the squirrels come back around."
11,"For anyone who likes board games. miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular. this is a great. fun. simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.What would the game be without Han & Chewie? The Falcon gives you these two characters as well as Lando and more. some extra abilities and a really nice. to-scale. model that you can also have fun with. 'Pew! Pew!' noises are an optional extra that you will have to supply yourself."
3,"Re-discovering all of Frank L Baum's 'Oz' books has been a hoot.  I read as many as I could get my hands on as a child; and so decided to check this one out on my new Kindel.  It's a lot of fun.  But no illustrations -- which are part of the fun of reading those books -- so that was a bit of a disappointment --  some misspelling and some dropped words from page to new page - but not so much that you cannot figure out what was supposed to be there.  I'd buy it in a hardcopy rather than Kindel edition. just to explore the illustrations (historical and fun in and of themselves)."
3,"The first three of these books fit together wonderfully as the opening trilogy of the John Carter of Mars series.  For pure fantasy adventure. few books have topped these.  The other two are somewhat lesser works but still very enjoyable.If  you are interested in Sword and Planet fiction for the kindle ebook. you should also check out the Alan Burt Akers series. which are direct descendents of Burroughs.  Transit to Scorpio is the first in that series.I would also recommend my own Talera series. which includes Swords of Talera. Wings Over Talera. and Witch of Talera. They are also available as ebooks. I see a lot of folks brag on their own books but I am proud of these books. and if you look at the reviews under the paperback versions you'll see that others enjoy them as well and consider them excellent modern continuations of the Sword and Planet tradition."
1,"We have sensors for temperature and humidity in our attic.  We found that regular batteries do not work well in the cold of Maine winters. Buy these Lithium batteries has made a huge difference. The extra cost is absorbed by their longevity.Here's my TIP on those attic sensors or transmitters: TIP: I did find it best to purchase and use &#34;Energizer Ultimate Lithium&#34; AA cells. Not only do these last longer but are not really affected by the hot or freezing temperatures found in attics (and you don't need to climb up there to replace batteries every couple of months)."
2,"Just received my Steamvac Jr. today and had pet stains waiting to be cleaned.  After they'd been around for a few weeks this little device didn't hold back the cleaning power.  Suction is awesome and I was so impressed I started to find things I wanted to clean...couch pillows. etc.  I just couldn't stop!  I'd recommend to anyone who's considering a handy. powerful tool of this nature.  (One note of caution...I didn't have the handles locked down all the way...my fault...and when lifting it off the counter after filling it up. it all hit the floor!!  Be aware of TWO locks. not one...)  It does come with a small bottle of cleaning agent which worked just fine but I purchased one separately anyway.  Enjoy!"
1,".Recently I have been on oxygen most of each day.  Although the oxygen helps the condition for which it was prescribed. it drys my nasal membranes.  So I get frequent nosebleeds.  Sometimes the nosebleeds cut off access to the oxygen.One of my therapists suggested I try Ayr products.  I found that Ayr produces a gel. nose drops. and a mist.  I decided upon the mist.Ayr Saline Nasal Mist is very helpful.  When my nose begins to bleed I spray the mist into my nose and it stops the bleeding.  My doctor explained that the sodium chloride in the mist helps form blood clots.I recommend Ayr Saline Nasal Mist for anyone struggling with nosebleeds."
2,"... is home-made ice cream. I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit. No mess. quick. easy. home made ice cream. Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted. Great for frozen drinks. too. including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction. powerful motor. It's noisy but not too much.The ice cream from this (or any) ice cream maker comes out soft serve. but it's really true. if you put the ice cream in the freezer for another 1-2 hours. it hardens to the exact same consistency as store-bought ice cream. It's surprising the first time you try this. because you think it'll come out solid like a block of ice. but it doesn't - it's soft but scoopable."
6,"I got this at the Big Box retailer that I despise.  Apparently. they only carry this in black.  URGH!!!  I LOVE that it comes in pink.  (Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it.  Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership. not that I'm plugging Amazon. but I love Amazon.)  I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries.  That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys. so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard. and it's also time consuming. I love this calculator - very useful."
4,"Most Reliable biblical movie. The Gospel According to Matthew WORD-FOR-WORD is in the form of a movie. If a movie is not word-for-word it is not biblical. It is Hollywood. i.e. the Devil. Hollywood versus the Bible. You choose what you will feed your mind with. This is my favorite movie of all the &#34;biblical&#34; movies I have. Part 2 to Matthew is Acts. also by Visual Bible and also word-for-word. I give them out as gifts. They are less offensive to unbelievers and the religiously lazy who has never even read their Bible."
3,"I am a new Kindle user and downloaded my first issue of Reader's digest and was simply delighted with it!  I read it from cover to cover over a few days time which I have never done in the hard copy of the magazine.  I love that there are no ads and found it easy to navigate between the articles and features.  Thanks Kindle and Reader's digest!Its a few months later and I am updating that I still LOVE this magazine in Kindle format. I have seen a few people complain about not getting their back issues but I have no trouble at all with it. I had been off for a few weeks and when I returned I went to my Manage my Kindle on Amazon and there was a down arrow where I could select which issue I wanted to download so I selected both I had not read and voila! Both are on my Kindle now for me to read.  No problems at all.  Enjoy the magazine!"
3,"I downloaded this as a Kindle freebie and since it was short. I read it in between other books in my TBR list. It was just okay on all counts - as erotica. it was passable; the plot wasn't exciting. but I did make it through to the end (although there wasn't really a burning need to); the characterization was okay - if the author had fleshed out her characters more. and improved the dialogue. it would've made a better book. There was some heat to it. and some of it was written pretty well. so that helped move the story along a little more than it would have otherwise. Since I did finish it to the end. and didn't hate it. I rated it as a 2.5. rounded up to 3."
3,"Mason doesn't believe his eyes/feelings because &#34;After all. it wasn't every day that one of his kind found his life mate in a throng of jacked-up caffeine addicts.&#34; A bull in a china shop would describe someone like him or half of the rest of the world. We all think we will never find our life mates but they are out there just keep reading this awesome story and you will see how it can be done.  &#34;Perhaps not the most erudite of phrases. but what it lacked in eloquence it more than made up for in conviction.&#34; and we are still in the first chapter.&#34;He stared down at her. his breath rushing through his slightly parted lips=and then he smiled. slow and sweet and beautiful.. &#34;Trust me. baby . I noticed&#34; smooth line.  Rhyannon Byrd does at up just right for this one and has me convinced. I hope to read more of her books. I enjoy her style. Keep up the good work"
4,"If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects. this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player. this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai. as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza. deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson. I have to say. has a very different personality. melodic approach. and technique from Vai and Satriani. but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."
1,"I get UTIs when I get overtired/overtextended. around twice a year.  I had been taking AZO but it did not control the pain from the most severe infections (which always happen Saturday at 4 pm when the Doctor is not available until Monday!).  AZO was OK for mild infections.So this time I did some research and people spoke highly of Cystex. Since I didn't have enough time to order it from Amazon I bought it at CVS.  It is significantly (25-30%) cheaper than AZO and works better (at least for me). For the most severe UTIs I would still go to the Doctor and get antibiotics but for moderate and inconveniently timed UTIs. Cystex works beautifully and is a real savior. The pain went away in about 20 minutes and after 2 days of suffering. it was wonderful."
1,"Its pretty good. its a lot like icy hot.  I guess I thought it would be stronger though.  Im using it on a sprained neck thats very painful so I didnt expect it to knock this kind of pain out completely but it helps ease the tension a bit.  My only complaint is it REALLY stinks.  Someone across the room from me at work asked me if I was eating a tunafish sandwich..lol.  It smells like tuna and kinda like rubber a little.  The smell makes me nausea after 3 days of use.  I never want to smell it again if my neck EVER heals..."
6,"I can always depend on Avery to give me a quality product.  These little labels are what we use the most in our household.  They are handy for everything.  We use them with the free downloadable templates from their website so they are positioned accurately and look crisp and professional.  You can just print one or a whole sheet... and now the directions are right on the back of each sheet. very handy.  If you collect boxtops for education. they are cleary displayed in an area that can easily be cut out without disturbing the contents.No jamming. yet each individual label is easier to pick up without dislodging the outside border.  No problems.Highly recommended quality product."
4,"As I watch this movie for over the 50th time. have to laugh more and more. The movie is fun. yet have to wonder how Santa tolerated the elf and reindeer bullying. Reindeer tease poor Rudolf because of his nose. The elves tease poor Herbie because he doesn't want to make toys. and the head elf makes him work through his ten minute break. a true labor law violation.The Land of Misfit Toys is quite the site. can't help but to blame the elves for such mistakes. And why santa never knew about this place. since he knows everything and everyplace.The Abominable Snowman is more funny than scary. and is very entertaining.Always a classic and the flaws in the plot have holes bigger than the Grand Canyon. but that adds to the fun.A great way to enjoy a night by the fireplace with the family and friends."
11,"I recently wrote a review for the Forbidden Island board game.  In it. I said that I have been playing board games for a very long time and it is getting harder to find games that I can say are actually better than most of the games I have played before.  Forbidden Island was one of them that I would say that about and so is Ticket To Ride.  Like Forbidden Island. Ticket To Ride is very easy to learn and to teach how to play.  It will appeal to players of all ages.  You play as the owner of a railroad line and you are trying to fulfill contracts by placing trains on routes that connect cities all over a map of the United States.  The more contracts you can fulfill. the more victory points you can accumulate.  There are a lot of expansion sets released. with lots of new maps from all over the world and many more ways to play.  Ticket To Ride is a must have for any board game collection."
11,"This is a lovely puzzle. The image is fun and the pieces go together very well. The size is just right for little hands too! The box is great too - I opened the top flap and my daughter had fun putting the pieces away. The rope handle makes it easy for her to lug it around too.However. it's lower quality and more expensive than other brands such as Ravensburger. It's going to get beat up faster - the pieces were easily bent and just in shipping some of the pointier corners were bumped up."
12,"Sim City 3000 is really cool!  You start off by making a Power Plant(I prefer Fusion or Microvave).laying power lines.zoning Residentail.Commercail.and Industrial areas.disposing of garbage.Making Roads and/or a Mass Transit System.Make Water Structures and pipelines.and Take care of Civic needs.  Later in the game you might want to enact some ordinances(rules/laws).Make business deals with neighbors and organizations.set a budget(earlier on the computer does it for you).build rewards which most of them can only be optained thru Business Deals( ones optained without deal:county courthouse.Mayoral Mansion also know as you're house.city hall.performing of arts center.and Monument/statue. ones optained thru deal:Gigamall.Amusement Park.Space Port.Defense Contractor.Country Golf Club.etc.).  Plus you can add Landmarks to you're City.  This is a Great game.but for Sim City 2000 fans that want a totaly different game get the Unlimited Version(also known as Sim City 3000 Unlimited)."
3,"Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids. to the extent that some are viewed as 'Jacen books' or 'Jania books.' The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However. the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel. but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order. Book 14). which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel. so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises."
4,"This entire series of Bible stories by this Italian production group is simply splendid.  These are relatively low cost films but they are very skillfully produced to maximize the quality of the story being told.  Of course we Christians and Jews will sit around and pontificate about every little error or short cut the movie script incurs. never the less. it is ultimately left to the actors and directors and their considerable skill to pull off what I consider to be. for the most part. some of the most successfully done Bible story dramatizations that have ever been produced on film. with or without a big budget.  My favorite is the story of Abram. the movie Joseph coming in a close second. and this movie. Moses. coming in a close third or even equalling Joseph.  Bravo bravo - Please make more!  My five stars applies to this complete series of movies - Obviously some are done a little better than others. but the effort is exemplary."
6,"We have been using Scotch brand tape products for decades but not. until now. have we used this product. It is difficult to rate it because of infrequent need but on the one occasion we have used it thus far. it did all that we had hoped it would. If the item remains firmly attached after a month or so. I will add a star to my rating. Meanwhile. perhaps other uses will emerge. Tests and evaluations continue.Meanwhile. again. I say 'Thank You' to the Amazonians for the Vine Program."
3,"I have a version of 'Star by Star' that does not include the novella 'Recovery.' so I downloaded this book onto my Fire.  'Recovery' tells of Leia's recovery after she was nearly killed in 'Balance Point.'  If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia's relationship. it surely failed.  There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation.  They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read?  Not really.  I could have skipped it (I actually did) and not miss much.  It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out. like in the DVD's. where it's billed as the extras.  People pay to see those extras.  I did.  It was worth it. but probably not to everyone."
9,"I am buying our third one for our third child.  This is a 'must have' for our kids between 18 months and 2 years.  The one we bought seven years ago is still going. albiet with a limp.  They have been used so much that the tires do wear out but the kids don't care!  The six and seven year olds still love their trikes as much as they do their two wheelers and they don't seem to notice that the wheels aren't round anymore.  Name one other toy you can buy for 25 bucks that lasts a kid from toddlerhood to first grade!"
12,"This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software. Then it did not have any voice sounds. Then it was running on windowed mode only. Now. everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer (BSoD).I give up. Codemasters. next time. dont rush a game out just because you have to. Test the game! If not for yourself for Colin himself. If he was alive he would be embarrassed.And don't buy the game using Steam because if it does not work. Steam will show you the finger :)"
9,"I love cooking with cast iron. This pan is great for making those 3 egg omlets. pancakes. fried eggs. etc. The low lip makes it easy to get the spatula under the eggs and flip them. On the down side if you fry bacon or sausages in it. the grease will spatter the stove. On a campfire that of course won't be a problem.However if you have limited space in your kitchen cabinet get the combo cooker. The lid is nearly as large as this one and you get the fry pan as well.On the plus side. this pan being thin fits right under the stack of cast iron pans I already own. So if you cook for a large family and want to serve everyone faster. this is a good way to go as an additional pan."
8,"I had purchased the Petmate Deluxe model of the 50-ounce Pet Fountain for my cats. That works exactly as described and my cats drink more than they did from bowls of water around the house. I like blue. and the basic model seemed as if it would perform the same as the deluxe model. My cats still drink from this model. but it doesn't fit together as well as the deluxe model and. as a result. it often leaks. leaving puddles around it. If I purchase another. I will only get the Deluxe model."
3,"I'm not fairy tales redux. but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and gobbled it up in one sitting. This was a great turn on the Beauty and the Beast plot.the sex scenes were hot and I actually like both the hero and the heroine.Don't get me wrong I wanted to slap the hero's face a time of four due to immature and often cruel behavior. but the author did such a great job with developing Hunter's character and weaving in his reasons for acting like a tyrant that I forgave him in pretty much the same vein as the heroine.  And he really redeemed himself at the end.Of course it was hard to stomach the heroine's self-sacrifice. but if she didn't then this book wouldn't have been a take on Beauty and the Beast.  So. I totally bought it and her not wanting to have sex with him but liking it because when she firsts meets him she's instantly attracted to him.This was another great read from Eve Vaughn."
11,"My 3 year old daughter LOVES animals. so this puzzle was a hit from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  The actual box it comes in has a nice flap top and it has a rope handle which makes it easy to carry around.  The puzzle itself is shiny cardboard.  The picture has great colors and is very bright. My only complaint is that the pieces didn't fit together easily unless you're on a perfectly flat surface (We tried to put it together on the carpet and we had a hard time getting everything to fit into the each other).  It's a fun puzzle and great for toddlers!"
3,"This book was a little slow in the beginning. but once the killing started. I had a hard time putting it down.  The kindle edition is a little rough due to some formatting problems. but it was definitely readable.  Williams does a great job with character definition and more than makes up for what the book lacks in plot.  The author's descriptions of violence are so well done that it is easy to visualize the gory details.  For fans of gratuitous violence. this book does not disappoint!"
1,"Gimmicky tech stuff drives me crazy. but this product is worth every penny you pay for it.  Although you might be used to scrubbing your teeth (and I admit that can be therapeutic at times). the super-charged foam will actually do a much more thorough job of ridding your teeth of plaque.  My oral hygenist said that use of the Sonicare has made my normally very good-looking gums fabulously heatlhy.  I'm another person that wishes I had had one years ago; it may have helped me prevent the loss of a tooth.My oldest son's orthodontist gave him a Sonicare. because they believe it is the most effective toothbrush for cleaning teeth with braces.  We're buying another for my younger son. as he now has a retainer. The sensation of using it may be a little unusual at first. but you will quickly become used to it.  Believe me. you want this product!"
1,"Sometimes it just makes sense to shell out the additional funds for a superior product. I have a very tough and fast-growing beard that is a challenge to all the different razors (manual and electric) I've tried over the past 45 years.  I have stayed with the Mach 3 ever since it first came out and even convinced my wife that it would be good for shaving her legs. Actually she picked it up once instead of using her usual disposable and from then on I kept finding my razor in the shower.I learned a long time ago when using knives and axes that a good cutting edge needs to be complimented by a proper handle.  Normally the heavier and more durable the handle. the better the cut.  The Mach 3 handle is slightly beefier than most and it makes a difference. resulting in a good angle during application and a smoother shave with no irritation.  Until someone can prove to me that there is a better razor out there. we're sticking with the Mach 3."
9,"Great and stone compacts inside the handle for smaller storage.  I bought this to sharpen my Cold Steel shovel and Trail Hawk while camping.  It's just the right size so you dont cut yourself while sharpening anything like a smaller stone.  It worked perfect.  this stone is better for sharpening items like shovels. axes and machete's than for a knife.  I have always been a fan of the verticle v shaped ceramic sticks for sharpening kinves and although this item would work.  its better for larger blades."
9,"We've had a great time as a family throwing this around the soccer fields.  Luckily we have a large park area with enough space for 4 soccer fields all together cause this thing really flies.  Its soft so that it doesn't hurt if one of the small ones misses their catch.  The hole in the middle provides a good way for someone to get a grip or to catch it ring toss style.  Light and easy to throw for all ages.  Get one of these. and get out for some family disc time.  You will be glad that you did."
3,"...with a twist of goth and one seriously bad serial killer!This book really held my interest all the way through. but then the ending came and went in a flash.  With so much build up. I would have thought the ending would take longer to complete itself - not so.The detail given to describe the setting of each scene was incredible.  Also. you were provided deep insight into the characters. even the lesser ones.  There was nothing vague about this book.Formatting was off. but it wasn't too distracting after a while."
